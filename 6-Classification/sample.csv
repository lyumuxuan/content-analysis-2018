0,"As part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Janssen to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of their drug ustekinumab, an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor, for treating moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease (CD). The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and Centre for Health Economics (CHE) Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the Company's submission, the ERG's critical review of submitted evidence, and the resulting NICE guidance. The main supporting clinical evidence was derived from four well conducted, randomised controlled trials, comparing ustekinumab with placebo in two sub-populations (conventional care failure and anti-TNFÎ± failure patients) of adults with moderate-to-severe CD. Three trials assessed treatment induction over 8Â weeks, while the fourth recruited successfully induced patients into a maintenance trial for 1Â year. These trials showed ustekinumab to be more effective than placebo in terms of its ability to induce and maintain clinical response and remission. In the absence of any direct head-to-head data, the Company conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA), which synthesised induction trial data on ustekinumab and relevant comparators (vedolizumab, adalimumab and infliximab) using placebo data as a common comparator. This analysis found ustekinumab to be of comparable efficacy to previously approved biologics in treatment induction. A 'treatment sequence analysis' compared long-term treatment efficacy, finding ustekinumab to be comparable in maintaining treatment response and remission to the three other biologic therapies. However, the ERG had identified many limitations and potential bias in this analysis, and urged caution when interpreting the results. The Company's economic model estimated ustekinumab to be dominant in both sub-populations compared with conventional care; however, the ERG's preferred base-case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Â£109,279 in the conventional care failure sub-population, and Â£110,967 in the anti-TNFÎ± failure sub-population when compared with conventional care. However, the ERG identified significant failings in both the model structure and data inputs, which could not be addressed without complete restructuring. The ERG considered that the economic analysis presented by the Company failed to adequately address the decision problem specified in NICE's scope. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended ustekinumab within its market authorisation, on the grounds of sufficiently similar efficacy and costs to previously recommended biologic therapies. However, the ERG's analyses demonstrated that all currently recommended biologics are unlikely to be cost effective relative to conventional care, raising broader questions regarding the appropriateness of cost-comparison exercises for decision making.",New Zealand,PharmacoEconomics,29192397,2017,Ustekinumab for Treating Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease after Prior Therapy: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.,n
1,"Although the effects of periphyton on water quality and its relationship with flow conditions have been studied by researchers, our understanding about their combined action in eutrophic shallow lakes is poor. In this research, four aquatic model ecosystems with different water circulation rates and hydraulic conditions were constructed to investigate the effect of periphyton and flow condition on water quality. The concentrations of NH4+, TP, and chlorophyll-a and flow conditions were determined. The results show that, as a result of the rising nutrient level at the early stage and the decline in the lower limit, the presence of periphyton can make the ecosystem adaptable to a wider range of nutrients concentration. In terms of the flow condition, the circulation rate and hydraulic condition are influential factors for aquatic ecosystem. Higher circulation rate in the ecosystem, on one hand, facilitates the metabolism by accelerating nutrient cycling which is beneficial to water quality; on the other hand, high circulation rate leads to the nutrient lower limit rising which is harmful to water quality improvement. At low velocities, slight differences in hydraulic conditions, vertical velocity gradient and turbulence intensity gradient could affect the quantity of phytoplankton. Our study suggests that, considering environmental effect of periphyton, flow conditions and their combined action is essential for water quality improvement and ecological restoration in eutrophic shallow lakes.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192398,2017,Water quality in simulated eutrophic shallow lakes in the presence of periphyton under different flow conditions.,n
2,"According to literature data, some of the main factors which significantly affect the quality of the indoor environment in residential households or apartments are human activities such as cooking, smoking, cleaning, and indoor exercising. The paper presents a literature overview related to air quality in everyday use spaces dedicated to specific purposes which are integral parts of residential buildings, such as kitchens, basements, and individual garages. Some aspects of air quality in large-scale car parks, as a specific type of indoor environment, are also discussed. All those areas are characterized by relatively short time use. On the other hand, high and very high concentration levels of xenobiotics can be observed, resulting in higher exposure risk. The main compounds or group of chemical compounds are presented and discussed. The main factors influencing the type and amount of chemical pollutants present in the air of such areas are indicated.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192399,2017,Indoor air quality of everyday use spaces dedicated to specific purposes-a review.,n
3,"Mercury concentrations in the environment tend to decrease in recent years due to environmental restrictions. Lakes store mercury in their sediments, making them potential secondary contamination sources. In South America, the occurrence of mercury in lake systems has been associated mainly with volcanic emissions and only few records anthropogenic contamination in the pre-Hispanic period. The objective of this research was to study historical anthropogenic mercury concentration in two lakes in Central Chile (La SeÃ±oraza and Pillo), in order to establish background mercury levels and their variations from preindustrial to modern periods. Different background levels and mercury concentrations were found in each lake, with significantly higher concentrations in Lake La SeÃ±oraza during the last 150Â years. Mining-related activities during the nineteenth century could have a negligible influence on mercury concentrations. Later on, the use of coal railroads and subsequent employment of mercury in the cellulose industry were associated with three- and fourfold increases in mercury concentration over the nineteenth century background levels, which decrease once these activities ceased. However, in the case of Lake Pillo, an important increase in mercury concentration can be observed between 1990 and the early twenty-first century, which could be related to a higher watershed/lake area ratio, extensive agriculture, and volcanic emission, being the latter that could have contributed with mercury to both systems. Nevertheless, sedimentological characteristics in Lake Pillo can be favorable to retain mercury in this aquatic system up to the present day.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192400,2017,Historical anthropogenic mercury in two lakes of Central Chile: comparison between an urban and rural lake.,n
4,"The occurrence, partitioning, and spatio-temporal distribution of seven pharmaceuticals for human use, three steroid hormones and one personal care product were determined in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment of PiraÃ­ Creek and JundiaÃ­ River (JundiaÃ­ River Basin, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). The maximum average detected concentrations of the compounds in the PiraÃ­ River samples were <â€‰30Â ngÂ L-1, except for caffeine (222Â ngÂ L-1). In JundiaÃ­ River samples, most of the compounds were frequently detected, wherein caffeine had the highest concentration, with maximum average concentrations of 14,050Â ngÂ L-1, followed by atenolol (431Â ngÂ L-1), ibuprofen (268Â ngÂ L-1) and diclofenac (214Â ngÂ L-1). Atenolol, propranolol, estrone, and triclosan were the contaminants most frequently detected in sediment and SPM samples. Triclosan had the highest average proportion of SPM as opposed to in the aqueous phase (>â€‰75%). Contaminants with acid functional groups showed, in general, a lower tendency to bind to particulate matter and sediments. In addition, hydrophobicity had an important effect on their environmental partitioning. The spatial distribution of contaminants along the JundiaÃ­ River was mainly affected by the higher concentration of contaminants in water samples collected downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results obtained here clearly showed the importance of the analysis of some contaminants in the whole water, meaning both dissolved and particulate compartments in the water, and that the partitioning is ruled by a set of parameters associated to the physicochemical characteristics of contaminants and the matrix properties of the studied, which need be considered in an integrated approach to understand the fate of emerging chemical contaminants in aquatic environments.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192401,2017,Spatio-temporal evaluation of emerging contaminants and their partitioning along a Brazilian watershed.,n
5,"In the present experimental analysis, two non-edible oils namely neem oil and pumpkin seed oil were considered. They are converted into respective biodiesels namely neem oil methyl ester (B1) and pumpkin seed oil methyl ester (B2) through transesterification process and their physical and chemical properties were examined using ASTM standards. Diesel was used as a baseline fuel in Kirloskar TV1 model direct injection four stroke diesel engine. A fuel preheater was designed and fabricated to operate at various temperatures (60, 70, and 80Â Â°C). Diesel showed higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) than biodiesel samples. Lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was obtained with diesel than B1 sample. B1 exhibited lower BSFC than B2 sample without preheating process. High preheating temperature (80Â Â°C) results in lower fuel consumption for B1 sample. The engine emission characteristics like carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke were found lower with B1 sample than diesel and B2 except oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission. In preheating of fuel, B1 sample with high preheating temperature showed lower CO, HC, and smoke emission (except NOx) than B2 sample.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192402,2017,Comparative studies on the performance and emissions of a direct injection diesel engine fueled with neem oil and pumpkin seed oil biodiesel with and without fuel preheater.,n
6,"Sulfaquinoxaline (SQX) is an antimicrobial of the sulfonamide class, frequently detected at low levels in drinking and surface water as organic micropollutant. The main goal of the present study is the evaluation of SQX reactivity during chlorination and UV irradiations which are two processes mainly used in water treatment plants. The SQX transformation by chlorination and UV lights (254Â nm) was investigated in purified water at common conditions used for water disinfection (pH =â€‰7.2, temperature =â€‰25Â Â°C, [chlorine] =â€‰3Â mgÂ L-1). The result shows a slow degradation of SQX during photolysis compared with chlorination process. Kinetic studies that fitted a fluence-based first-order kinetic model were used to determine the kinetic constants of SQX degradation; they were equal to 0.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4 and 0.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10-2Â s-1corresponding to the half time lives of 162 and 1.64Â min during photolysis and chlorination, respectively. In the second step, seven by-products were generated during a chlorination and photo-transformation of SQX and identified using liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). SO2 extrusion and direct decomposition were the common degradation pathway during photolysis and chlorination. Hydroxylation and isomerization were observed during photodegradation only while electrophilic substitution was observed during chlorination process.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192403,2017,Transformation of sulfaquinoxaline by chlorine and UV light in water: kinetics and by-product identification.,n
7,"The sorption of both classic and emerging organic contaminants onto aquatic solids is a critical process that controls their fate in natural waters. Sorption is affected by numerous factors, including coexisting heavy metals. The mechanisms of the influence of heavy metals, especially those occurring in acid radical anions, are still unclear. Here, the effects of Pb, Cd, Cr, and As on the sorption of lindane and norfloxacin (NOR) onto natural biofilms, suspended particles, and sediments from one river were investigated following batch equilibration methods. In addition, changes in representative components that have important roles in sorption from these solids in the presence and absence of metals were characterized by spectrum analyses. The results indicated that sorption of lindane and NOR on the three solids in the absence of heavy metals was highly linear and nonlinear, respectively. Pb and Cd promoted and Cr and As suppressed hydrophobic lindane sorption on the three solids. This was because Pb and Cd enhanced but Cr and As weakened the hydrophobicity of these solids. Pb, Cd, Cr, and As decreased NOR sorption on sediments and suspended particles at pHÂ 5.7~6.3. This was due to electrostatic competition between cationic Pb/Cd and NORH2+, and the combination of Cr/As acid radicals with NORH2+, which suppressed its ion-exchange adsorption. Pb, Cd, Cr, and As generally increased the sorption of NOR onto the biofilms at pHÂ 5.7~6.3. Pb and Cd strengthened the flocculation of dissolved organic matter combined with NORH2+ onto the biofilms. Cr and As enhanced the hydrophilicity of biofilms, and then increased their sorption of NOR with active hydrophilic groups. The mechanisms of how different heavy metals affect NOR sorption by biofilms were more complicated than the mechanisms affecting lindane sorption, as well as by sediments and particles.",Germany,Environmental science and pollution research international,29192404,2017,"Effects of lead, cadmium, chromium, and arsenic on the sorption of lindane and norfloxacin by river biofilms, particles, and sediments.",n
8,"The formulation factors relevant to developing immediate and controlled release dosage forms containing poorly soluble drugs dispersed in amorphous systems are poorly understood. While the utility of amorphous solid dispersions is becoming apparent in the pharmaceutical marketplace, literature reports tend to concentrate on the development of solid dispersion particulates, which then must be formulated into a tablet. Amorphous solid dispersions of itraconazole in high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were prepared by KinetiSolÂ® Dispersing and tablets were formulated to immediately disintegrate or control the release of itraconazole. Formulated tablets were evaluated by two non-sink dissolution methodologies and the dosage form properties that controlled the gelling tendency of the dispersion carrier, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, were investigated.

10,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) are useful cell model to study adipogenesis and energy metabolism. However, the biological characteristics of bovine ADSCs (bADSCs) remain unclear. This study aimed to isolate and identify bADSCs and further investigate fatty acid (FA)-related gene expression and composition of FAs during adipogenesis. The growth curve showed the bADSCs of P5 cells had rapid proliferation superior to P10-P50. The colony formation assay showed colony number of P5 cells was higher than that of P50 cells (51.67Â Â±Â 3.06 vs 35.67Â Â±Â 6.43, PÂ <Â 0.05). The immunofluorescence showed that bADSCs were positive for CD13, CD44, CD49d, CD90, CD105, and Vimentin while negative for CD34. The multipotential towards adipocyte, osteocyte, and chondrocyte was confirmed by specific histological staining and lineage gene expression. During adipogenic induction, the genes related to lipogenesis and lipolysis were assessed by real-time PCR and the FA composition was detected by GC-MS. Expression of lipogenesis-related genes showed coordinated regulation as peaking on day 7 and declining until induction ended, including PPARÎ³, SREBP1, ACC1, FAS, ELOVL6, SCD1, and FABP4. FA deposition-related genes (DGAT1 and ACAT1) increased until day 14. Lipolysis genes (CPT-1A, VLCAD, and ACO) showed a variant expression pattern. The profile of FAs showed that proportion of the FAs (C4-C15, â‰¥Â C22) increased, but proportion of long-chain fatty acids (C16-C20) reduced after induction. And saturated FAs (SFA) decreased while monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) increased during adipogenesis. These data suggest that bADSCs possess the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells and have active de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and desaturation of FAs during adipogenesis.",Germany,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

11,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is a potent inducer of bone formation that is currently used in a limited number of clinical indications to treat extensive bone loss. Extending the field of applications of this molecule requires design of the delivery system to protect the protein from early degradation and allow a slow long-term release. This study describes the use of a non-polymer hydrogel, based on the self-assembly of small amphiphilic glycosyl-nucleolipids into micellar structures, as a new type of delivery system for BMP-2. BMP-2 was readily encapsulated in glycosyl-nucleosyl-fluorinated (GNF)-based gels and slowly released in vitro, while maintaining its osteogenic activity. When hydrogel pieces containing fluorophore-tagged BMP-2 were deposited onto a calvaria defect in mouse, the signal detected in living mice gradually decreased and was still detectable at 3Â weeks. Gel-embedded protein promoted significant calvarial bone defect regeneration at 8Â weeks after surgery. In contrast, when a solution of BMP-2 without hydrogel was injected into the defects, the fluorescence signal decreased rapidly and no significant bone formation was observed. The unique property of the GNF-based hydrogel as an injectable delivery system for low doses of BMP-2 was revealed in a subcutaneous model of ectopic bone formation. Injected BMP-2-laden GNF hydrogel blocks elicited the formation of cancellous bone, showing all the typical features of remodeling bone that contains bone marrow. These results show that this GNF-based hydrogel is an easy-to-use, efficient delivery system for BMP-2 and osteogenic material to support bone regeneration.",United States,Drug delivery and translational research,29192408,2017,Prolonged delivery of BMP-2 by a non-polymer hydrogel for bone defect regeneration.,n
13,"OBJECTIVE
A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment. The authors have developed software through which students can experience the practice of psychiatry (in particular, with dementia patients) in its entirety. This study compares this software with conventional learning methods.


METHOD
The control group was 43 fifth-year medical students in 2014 who studied using a conventional learning method (taking lectures and being in contact with actual patients). The experimental group was 36 fifth-year medical students in 2015 that used computer software (taking lectures and with reduced time in contact with actual patients). The authors compared the two groups. Each group was tested before and after clinical training on their acquisition of knowledge of dementia. The control group was tested in 2014, and the experimental group was tested in 2015.


RESULTS
The difference in average test scores between the two groups was statistically significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), with the experimental group scoring higher.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that students who were taught using a computer-based software method were better able to answer a standard series of questions designed to evaluate their understanding of dementia than those who were taught in a conventional manner.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between serum NRG4 levels and various metabolic parameters in women with PCOS. This cross-sectional study included 40 women with PCOS and 40 age- and BMI-matched controls without PCOS. NRG4, fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, hs-CRP, LDL-C, HDL-C, SHBG, DHEA-SO4 and total-testosterone levels were measured in all the participants. HOMA-IR was used to calculate the insulin resistance. Serum NRG4 levels were higher in women with PCOS than in healthy women (24.89 Â± 9.32 [ng/mL] vs. 18.98 Â± 6.40 [ng/mL], p = 0.002). FBG, LDL-C, HDL-C, LH, SHBG, FAI, DHEA-SO4, insulin, hs-CRP, HOMA-IR and total-testosterone levels were significantly higher in women with PCOS than controls. Circulating NRG4 levels were positively correlated with HOMA-IR, insulin and hs-CRP for both groups. There was a positive correlation between NRG4 and FBG in the PCOS group. HOMA-IR and hs-CRP were associated with NRG4.

To assess the safety and efficacy of electrosurgical bipolar vessel sealing during vaginal hysterectomy in morbidly obese patients MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 105 morbidly obese patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy due to benign gynecologic pathologies between January 2010 and April 2017 were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether conventional suture ligation technique (n = 64) or electrosurgical bipolar vessel sealing (n = 41) were used during vaginal hysterectomy. The surgical procedure was performed with the same technique in both study groups. The primary outcomes were duration of surgery and estimated blood loss. The secondary outcomes were intra-operative complications and post-operative complications.


RESULTS
The duration of surgery and estimated blood loss in the vessel sealing group was significantly less than in the conventional suture group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was present between the two groups in the rate of intra-operative and post-operative complications.


CONCLUSIONS
The primary outcome of our study is that the EBVS system can be used equally and even more effectively in some aspects; and as safe an alternative approach to conventional suture ligation technique during vaginal hysterectomies performed specifically on morbidly obese patients with reduced operation times and blood loss, and without increasing the complication rates.",Poland,Ginekologia polska,29192412,2017,Safety and efficacy of using advanced electrosurgical bipolar vessel sealing during vaginal hysterectomy in morbidly obese patients: a retrospective cohort analysis.,n

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. TNBC is usually diagnosed at a relatively young age and is characterized by high risk of developing metastases. Some epigenetic regulation of gene expression is associated with TNBC. Expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as a potential tool for identifying critical biomarkers in TNBC. The aim of our study is to examine expression of selected miRNAs in TNBC and to assess the relationship between miRNA expression and clinicopathological factors.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Expression levels of 19 selected miRNAs were compared between cancerous and normal breast tissues by use of qPCR method. We have evaluated the relationship between the expression level of miRNAs and clinicopathological factors such as: age, tumor size and lymph node status.


RESULTS
We found that in TNBC tissues, when compared with normal breast tissues, the expression of miR-190a, miR- 136-5p and miR-126-5p was significantly reduced (p = 0.0041, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0007, respectively) whereas expression of miR-135b-5p and miR-182-5p was significantly increased (p = 0.0194, p = 0.0041, respectively). We found a linear trend for tumor size and expression of miR-126-5p (p = 0.0296) and miR-135b-5p (p = 0.0241).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study confirms that miRNA expression profile is dysregulated in TNBC patients compared to healthy controls. MiR-190a, miR-136-5p, miR-126-5p, miR-135b-5p and miR-182-5p may be associated with development and progression of TNBC.",Poland,Ginekologia polska,29192413,2017,Dysregulation of microRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer.,n

The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of advanced stage (stage IIIB-IVB) ovarian cancer (OC) patients with intestinal metastasis, and to investigate the factors that affect survival.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery (CS) for FIGO stage IIIB-IVB OC with metastasis in the intestinal system, at Tepecik Research and Treatment Hospital between 2008-2014, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with borderline ovarian tumor; those who had previously undergone radiation therapy and/or hysterectomy and patients having secondary or tertiary cytoreduction were excluded and 49 patients were included and analyzed in this study. Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling, resection of bulky lymph nodes and omentectomy were performed. Optimal cytoreduction was accepted as that which left residual tumor â‰¤ one cm maximum size.


RESULTS
The risk factors affecting OS interval were investigated according to Cox' regression analysis. Optimality of the primary CS (P = 0.008 and HR = 5.202) and cancer stage (P = 0.016 and HR = 6.083) were found to be statistically significant factors.


CONCLUSIONS
Achieving optimal CS is the most important aim for the general surgeon carrying out an intestinal resection procedure. Although resection procedures are superior in providing the desired optimal results when compared to excision surgery, their higher complication rates and subsequent lower quality of life must be taken into consideration when choosing either resection or excision methods; surgical intervention should always be kept to the minimum possible.",Poland,Ginekologia polska,29192414,2017,Outcomes of patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer with intestinal metastasis.,n
18,"OBJECTIVES
Downregulation of DIRAS3 (DIRAS family, GTP-binding Ras-like 3) is related to ovarian and breast cancer progression. A possible mechanism that silences this gene is the promoter region DNA methylation. The potential reversibility of this epigenetic mechanism makes it more attractive candidate for new mode of cancer treatment. DIRAS3 regulates cell cycle, tumor dormancy and inhibits cancer cell growth and motility, all of which may indirectly depend on interaction with STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) classified as a potential oncogene. The restoration of DIRAS3 expression could inhibit cell proliferation and invasiveness.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Human ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780) and human breast cancer cell line (MCF7) were exposed to two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi): decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) [25 Î¼M and 12.5 Î¼M] and RG108 [150 Î¼M and 100 Î¼M]. In vitro migration changes of cancer cells were examined with wound healing assay. After 7 days of DNMTi treatment cells were harvested and DNA and RNA was isolated. The methylation status of the promoter sequences of DIRAS3 and STAT3 genes was determined using methylation specific PCR (MS-PCR). Level of target genes' expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (QRT-PCR).


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The in vitro wound healing assay showed changes in the migration rate of both adherent cell lines after DNMTi treatment compared to the untreated cells. Relative balance between methylated and unmethylated variants of DIRAS3 after MS-PCR was shifted towards unmethylated version after DNMTi treatment in A2780 cells.

To investigate the possible association of vasculogenic mimicry (VM), VE-cadherin and MIG-7 expression with clinicopathological features of women with malignant ovarian masses.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
VM was studied with the PAS reaction and VE-cadherin was assessed with immunohistochemistry in 108 women with malignant ovarian tumors. Additionally, quantitative expression of MIG-7 mRNA was performed in 52 ovarian cancers with qRT-PCR.


RESULTS
VM was found in 48/108 cases (44%), more often in higher FIGO stage tumors (83% cases; 40 vs. 8; p = 0.01). High expression of VE-cadherin was present in 37% of all ovarian masses. Ovarian tumors without VM more often expressed low levels of VE-cadherin than tumors where VM was found (37.6% vs.14.6%). No expression or very low expression of MIG-7 mRNA was found in all normal ovarian tissues and in 32 cancer samples. Median RQ of MIG-7 mRNA in tumor samples was higher than in normal ovarian tissue (RQ = 0.29 vs. RQ = 0.05, respectively; p < 0.005) and higher than in non-malignant ovarian masses (0.98 vs. 0.05 respectively; p = 0.03). Expression of MIG-7 mRNA was significantly correlated with VM (p = 0.039). In tumors with PAS-positive structures median RQ MIG-7 mRNA was higher than in tumors with PAS-negative findings (1.89 vs. 0.13 respectively). VE-cadherin expression was more frequently found in tumors where MIG-7 mRNA was present (p = 0.004).


CONCLUSIONS

20,"Although hysteroscopy is currently the undisputed gold standard for the examination of the uterine cavity in women with suspected endometrial cancer, it remains controversial as a procedure that can enhance metastasis spread. Endometrial cancer cells may shed during hysteroscopy and be passively transported with fluid flow into the peritoneal cavity. The paper presents the review of current knowledge regarding the risk of neoplasm metastases in women who had diagnostic hysteroscopy and the conditions that have to be met for the procedure to be safe. We searched PubMed, Ovid, Medline and Scopus databases for data published in the years 1985-2017. The following browsing criteria, the ""MeSH headings"": hysteroscopy, endometrial cancer, intraperitoneal or metastatic spread were used to find relevant papers. Based on the current data analysis we conclude that (1.) diagnostic hysteroscopy performed in women with endometrial cancer, especially in its early stages, is a very useful, efficient and safe diagnostic method and (2.) the distension media used for endoscopic procedures in the uterine cavity must be strictly controlled for relatively low pressures to prevent the increase in risk of endometrial cancer intraperitoneal spread.",Poland,Ginekologia polska,29192417,2017,Diagnostic hysteroscopy and the risk of malignant cells intraabdominal spread in women with endometrial cancer.,n

Mitotane is the most important drug in adrenal cancer chemotherapy. Mitotane's mode of action is not entirely explained. Animal studies have shown that the substance exerts a direct cytotoxic effect on the cells of the adrenal cortex. This activity is selective, progressive and affects only the zona reticularis and fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Mitotane inhibits cortisol synthesis by disrupting the chain of cholesterol. It has been suggested, that mitotane also affects the peripheral metabolism of steroids, especially of transcortin (CBG).

24,"BACKGROUND
Although critical care ultrasound (CCUS) in the Intensive Care Unit has been increasing exponentially for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, the lack of a uniform formal training structure and programme has posed the question of whether scans have been appropriately performed or reported, and whether there exists proper clinical governance to ensure a high standard of care.


METHODS
An online survey was sent to the representatives of various national intensive care societies via the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine CoBaTrICE committee. A comparison between 5 worldwide accreditation programmes was also made.


RESULTS
Twenty-seven out of 42 countries replied our survey. Five countries had a nationally accredited programme in ICM Echocardiography while six were in the process of developing one. Three countries had a CCUS-accredited programme. Most had local programmes. Transthoracic echocardiography, lung and vascular ultrasound were considered essential. Although CCUS training programmes should incorporate a combination of theoretical and practical teaching, it is not clear which is the best format. The main barriers to delivering CCUS training included a lack of formally agreed competencies, as well as a lack of trainers and time. There is also a lack of agreement between the five accreditation programmes.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a need for a well-structured and competent CCUS training program. The use of ultrasound in critical care for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes has been increasing exponentially. Once the remit of radiologists and cardiologists, point-of-care ultrasound and focused echocardiography is becoming an increasingly routine instrument for all acute specialties including intensive care medicine, despite the lack of evidence that it improves patient mortality in the ICU setting.",Poland,Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,29192421,2017,The state of critical care ultrasound training in Europe: A survey of trainers and a comparison of available accreditation programmes.,n

26,"BACKGROUND
Bisphosphonates are considered to be the treatment of choice for people with Paget's disease of bone. However, the effects of bisphosphonates on patient-centred outcomes have not been extensively studied. There are insufficient data to determine whether reducing and maintaining biochemical markers of bone turnover to within the normal range improves quality of life and reduces the risk of complications.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for adult patients with Paget's disease of bone.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge and trials registers up to March 2017. We searched regulatory agency published information for rare adverse events.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of bisphosphonates as treatment for Paget's disease in adults.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed studies for risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 20 trials (25 reports, 3168 participants). Of these, 10 trials (801 participants) compared bisphosphonates (etidronate, tiludronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, olpadronate, alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate) versus placebo, seven compared two bisphosphonates (992 participants), one trial compared a bisphosphonates with a bisphosphonate plus calcitonin (44 participants), and two studies, the largest trial (1331 participants) and its interventional extension study (502 participants), compared symptomatic treatment and intensive treatment where the goal was to normalise alkaline phosphatase.Most studies were assessed at low or unclear risk of bias. Six of 10 studies comparing bisphosphonates versus placebo were assessed at high risk of bias, mainly around incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.Participant populations were reasonably homogeneous in terms of age (mean age 66 to 74 years) and sex (51% to 74% male). Most studies included participants who had elevated alkaline phosphatase levels whether or not bone pain was present. Mean follow-up was six months.Bisphosphonates versus placeboBisphosphonates tripled the proportion (31% versus 9%) of participants whose bone pain disappeared (RR 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 8.90; 2 studies, 205 participants; NNT 5, 95% CI 1 to 31; moderate-quality evidence). This result is clinically important. Data were consistent when pain change was measured as any reduction (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.01; 7 studies, 481 participants).There was uncertainty about differences in incident fractures: 1.4% fractures occurred in the bisphosphonates group and none in the placebo group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.31; 4 studies, 356 participants; very low-quality evidence).None of the studies reported data on orthopaedic surgery, quality of life or hearing thresholds.Results regarding adverse effects and treatment discontinuation were uncertain. There was a 64% risk of mild gastrointestinal adverse events in intervention group participants and 48% in the control group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.92; 6 studies, 376 participants; low-quality evidence). The likelihood of study participants discontinuing due to adverse effects was slightly higher in intervention group participants (4.4%) than the control group (4.1%) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.52; 6 studies, 517 participants; low-quality evidence). Zoledronate was associated with an increased risk of transient fever or fatigue (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.44; 1 study, 176 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Bisphosphonates versus active comparatorMore participants reported pain relief with zoledronate than pamidronate (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 89 participants; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 11) or risedronate (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.74; 1 study, 347 participants; NNT 7, 95% CI 4 to 24; very low quality evidence). This result is clinically important.There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude differences in adverse effects of bisphosphonates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.76; 2 studies, 437 participants; low-quality evidence) and treatment discontinuation (2 studies, 437 participants) (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.59; 2 studies, 437 participants; very low-quality evidence).Intensive versus symptomatic treatmentThere was no consistent evidence of difference to response in bone pain, bodily pain or quality of life in participants who received intensive versus symptomatic treatment.Inconclusive results were observed regarding fractures and orthopaedic procedures for intensive versus symptomatic treatment (intensive treatment for fracture: RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.44; absolute risk 8.1% versus 5.2%; orthopaedic procedures: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.11; absolute risk 5.6% versus 3.0%; 1 study, 502 participants; low-quality evidence).There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude an important difference in adverse effects between intensive and symptomatic treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.41; low-quality evidence).There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude an important difference of risk of rare adverse events (including osteonecrosis of the jaw) from the regulatory agencies databases.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
We found moderate-quality evidence that bisphosphonates improved pain in people with Paget's disease of bone when compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the results of head-to-head studies investigating bisphosphonates. We found insufficient evidence of benefit in terms of pain or quality of life from intensive treatment. Information about adverse effects was limited, but serious side effects were rare, and rate of withdrawals due to side effects was low.",England,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,29192423,2017,Bisphosphonates for Paget's disease of bone in adults.,n
27,"BACKGROUND
Cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by a parasitic infection, is considered one of the most serious skin diseases in many low- and middle-income countries. Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis (OWCL) is caused by species found in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and India. The most commonly prescribed treatments are antimonials, but other drugs have been used with varying success. As OWCL tends to heal spontaneously, it is necessary to justify the use of systemic and topical treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effects of therapeutic interventions for the localised form of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis.


SEARCH METHODS
We updated our searches of the following databases to November 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We wrote to national programme managers, general co-ordinators, directors, clinicians, WHO-EMRO regional officers of endemic countries, pharmaceutical companies, tropical medicine centres, and authors of relevant papers for further information about relevant unpublished and ongoing trials. We undertook a separate search for adverse effects of interventions for Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis in September 2015 using MEDLINE.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials of either single or combination treatments in immunocompetent people with OWCL confirmed by smear, histology, culture, or polymerase chain reaction. The comparators were either no treatment, placebo/vehicle, and/or another active compound.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias and extracted data. We only synthesised data when we were able to identify at least two studies investigating similar treatments and reporting data amenable to pooling. We also recorded data about adverse effects from the corresponding search.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 89 studies (of which 40 were new to this update) in 10,583 people with OWCL. The studies included were conducted mainly in the Far or Middle East at regional hospitals, local healthcare clinics, and skin disease research centres. Women accounted for 41.5% of the participants (range: 23% to 80%). The overall mean age of participants was 25 years (range 12 to 56). Most studies lasted between two to six months, with the longest lasting two years; average duration was four months. Most studies were at unclear or high risk for most bias domains. A lack of blinding and reporting bias were present in almost 40% of studies. Two trials were at low risk of bias for all domains. Trials reported the causative species poorly.Here we provide results for the two main comparisons identified: itraconazole (200 mg for six to eight weeks) versus placebo; and paromomycin ointment (15% plus 10% urea, twice daily for 14 days) versus vehicle.In the comparison of oral itraconazole versus placebo, at 2.5 months' follow up, 85/125 participants in the itraconazole group achieved complete cure compared to 54/119 in the placebo group (RR 3.70, 95% CI 0.35 to 38.99; 3 studies; 244 participants). In one study, microbiological or histopathological cure of skin lesions only occurred in the itraconazole group after a mean follow-up of 2.5 months (RR 17.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 612.21; 20 participants). However, although the analyses favour oral itraconazole for these outcomes, we cannot be confident in the results due to the very low certainty evidence. More side effects of mild abdominal pain and nausea (RR 2.36, 95% CI 0.74 to 7.47; 3 studies; 204 participants) and mild abnormal liver function (RR 3.08, 95% CI 0.53 to 17.98; 3 studies; 84 participants) occurred in the itraconazole group (as well as reports of headaches and dizziness), compared with the placebo group, but again we rated the certainty of evidence as very low so are unsure of the results.When comparing paromomycin with vehicle, there was no difference in the number of participants who achieved complete cure (RR of 1.00, 95% CI 0.86, 1.17; 383 participants, 2 studies) and microbiological or histopathological cure of skin lesions after a mean follow-up of 2.5 months (RR 1.03, CI 0.88 to 1.20; 383 participants, 2 studies), but the paromomycin group had more skin/local reactions (such as inflammation, vesiculation, pain, redness, or itch) (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.01; 4 studies; 713 participants). For all of these outcomes, the certainty of evidence was very low, meaning we are unsure about these results.Trial authors did not report the percentage of lesions cured after the end of treatment or speed of healing for either of these key comparisons.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
There was very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of itraconazole and paromomycin ointment for OWCL in terms of cure (i.e. microbiological or histopathological cure and percentage of participants completely cured). Both of these interventions incited more adverse effects, which were mild in nature, than their comparisons, but we could draw no conclusions regarding safety due to the very low certainty of the evidence for this outcome.We downgraded the key outcomes in these two comparisons due to high risk of bias, inconsistency between the results, and imprecision. There is a need for large, well-designed international studies that evaluate long-term effects of current therapies and enable a reliable conclusion about treatments. Future trials should specify the species of leishmaniasis; trials on types caused by Leishmania infantum, L aethiopica, andL donovani are lacking. Research into the effects of treating women of childbearing age, children, people with comorbid conditions, and those who are immunocompromised would also be helpful.It was difficult to evaluate the overall efficacy of any of the numerous treatments due to the variable treatment regimens examined and because RCTs evaluated different Leishmania species and took place in different geographical areas. Some outcomes we looked for but did not find were degree of functional and aesthetic impairment, change in ability to detect Leishmania, quality of life, and emergence of resistance. There were only limited data on prevention of scarring.",England,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,29192424,2017,Interventions for Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis.,n

Thus, with the help of theoretical understandings, especially those by Michel Foucault, medical secrecy is considered a defense of rationality specific to populations' government.

67,"In our western world, it has long been thought that humans are exceptions within nature. They have defined themselves as human beings as opposed to animals and things, on account of characteristics that they regarded as essential. However it now seems necessary to question this perception of humanity and the human condition.Indeed, longer life expectancy together with its related pathologies and medical progress lead us to think differently. Today we realise that those qualities which were thought to belong specifically to human beings, such as awareness, reason, memory and free will, can disappear. Should we conclude then that those whose capacities have decreased or disappeared have become less human or have even lost all human qualities?Such questioning leads to new ways of describing humans whereby they would be defined not in substantial but rather in interpersonal terms.Surely being a person means first and foremost that we live through and for others. And the ethics of care that define men as vulnerable beings, that is to say dependent and needing their fellow human beings' solicitude, would surely offer the possibility of creating a new ?revisited' concept of the person?",France,Recherche en soins infirmiers,29192464,2017,,y
68,"In nursing institut teachers accompany students with whom they establish a pedagogical relationship, while guaranteeing compliance with internal rules, particularly concerning the banning of mobile phones during teaching. This complex double mission includes, among others, the forbidding of cell phones in classroom.


OBJECTIVE
this study aims at understanding the involved relational mechanism through the following question: how teachers articulate pedagogical relationship with their required authority at the same time?


METHODOLOGY
qualitative study performed between 2015 and 2016 using semi structured interviews interviews of teachers and students of the nursing school.


RESULTS
teachers give importance to the quality of relationship, but arrange differently to link authority and training missions. Students accept and recognize this authority as it is part of the internal rules. This legitimacy allows setting up a cooperative pedagogical relation. The internal rules contribute to build up the authority of teachers' team.


CONCLUSION
This study opens perspectives for reflection on the notions of relationship, rules, legitimacy and collaboration. Authority is a complex phenomenon which fits, just like pedagogical relation, in a frame providing stability and legitimacy. The internal rules would not standardize the behaviors, but would allow expressing individual liberty.",France,Recherche en soins infirmiers,29192465,2017,,y

This positive recovery despite a deleterious context of study questions about this schooling, and on possible resilient mechanisms and tutors of resilience. This research paper in educational sciences will begin with a synthesis of the results of publications about stressors and risk's factors of burnout of these students. We will see how this schooling can be linked to the concept of vulnerability and resilience. Then, we will present the results and the thematic analysis of 30 semi-directive interviews. The objectives of those ones were: to check factors vulnerability of this training, to determine if resilient processes can be observed, and to identify the characteristics of the resilience tutors of these weakened students. After the presentation of the results and of the analysis, we will discuss the links between vulnerability, post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout. We will explain the concept of compassion as one of the predominant characteristics of tutors.

72,"BACKGROUND
Natural antioxidants represent an effective option in the prevention and/or improvement of ultraviolet radiations (UVR)-induced/aggravated skin conditions. UVR cause DNA damage in keratinocytes, directly, in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), or indirectly, through oxidative stress production. Failure of the repair system can result in genetic mutations primarily responsible for the initiation of NMSCs. The aim of our study was to evaluate the in vitro protective effect of milk thistle and olive purified extracts on cultured keratinocytes after solar simulator irradiations (SSR).


METHODS
Immortalized keratinocytes were pre-incubated with different concentrations of milk thistle and olive purified extracts, and irradiated with increasing doses of SSR. Thereafter, CPDs and p53 expression were evaluated to assess DNA damage, whereas cellular antioxidants consumption and lipid membranes peroxidation were measured to analyse oxidative stress.


RESULTS
The study substances were well tolerated by cells and displayed good cytoprotective and anti-oxidant activities, being milk thistle dry extract more effective in limiting the direct DNA damage, and olive extract particularly able to reduce lipid membrane peroxidation and to increase cellular antioxidants.


CONCLUSIONS
Both study substances can be defined as safe compounds, showing differential cytoprotective and anti-oxidant activities and might represent interesting options for NMSCs chemoprevention.",Italy,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",29192469,2017,Milk thistle and olive extract: old substances with a new mission against sun-induced skin damage.,n
73,"BACKGROUND
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis in up to one third of psoriatic patients. Clinically it's characterized from an insidious onset. To help clinicians screen for PsA, several screening tools have been developed. The psoriatic arthritis screening and evaluation questionnaire (PASE) is one of the most used in the Psocare units. The sensibility of PASE is of 83% with a cut off of 47 or greater. The aim of our study is to create an Italian self-administered questionnaire, lighter than the PASE, able to identify patients who need a rheumatologic consultation.


METHODS
Between April and June 2016 an Italian group of dermatologists and rheumatologists from north Italy developed a new questionnaire called Screening Tool for Rheumatologic Investigation in Psoriatic Patient (STRIPP). Two hundred and twelve patients with the diagnosis of psoriasis, were screened with STRIPP by dermatologists and all of them sent to the rheumatologist.


RESULTS
Forty seven out of 212 patients received the diagnosis of early psoriatic arthritis. Statistical analysis (Spearman Rank correlation test, Mann Whitney test) showed a specificity of 93.3% and a sensibility of 91.5% taking a point of 3.5 as a cut-off.


CONCLUSIONS
The STRIPP is a very easy questionnaire, quick to out and has a very high sensitivity and specificity, higher than the PASE. Our future goal will be to screen more patients for validating the STRIPP questionnaire.",Italy,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",29192470,2017,The STRIPP questionnaire (Screening Tool for Rheumatologic Investigation in Psoriatic Patients) as a new tool for the diagnosis of early psoriatic arthritis.,n
74,"BACKGROUND
Inadequate treatment and delayed access to care represent critical issues regarding psoriasis. In Italy, patients treated with biologics are scanty and patients' misinformation could interfere with both biologics prescription and access to care. Literature provide data on disease awareness and perception about biologics in already-treated patients, but there is a lack of information concerning patients never treated with such drugs.


METHODS
We conducted a national survey including three academic-based psoriasis care centers at Bologna, Rome and Catania. A questionnaire named Psoriatic Patients's Awareness on Biologics (PPAB) was administered to patients naÃ¯ve for biologics and accessing for the fist-time to a psoriasis care center.


RESULTS
Patients from Northern Italy referred to more reliable sources of information and awareness on biologics decreased from North to South. The increase of the Psoriasis Area Severity Index was associated to unawareness about biologics and impaired self-evaluation on the eligibility to treatment. Patients under systemic conventional/multiple therapy were more likely to be unaware about biologics.


CONCLUSIONS
Our survey demonstrates that psoriatic patients' awareness is still an unmet need. For more, patients potentially eligible for biologics (severe or treated with systemic conventional/multiple therapy) were less informed. We believe that patients' misinformation could have delayed the access to a psoriasis care center, so that when patients sought help their condition was more severe and required systemic conventional/multiple therapy. Our results reiterate the importance of physicians in the information process and urge the need of a common network among office dermatologists, general practitioners and psoriasis care centers.",Italy,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",29192471,2017,Biologic agents perception in patients attending for the first-time to psoriasis centers: a multicenter Italian survey.,n
80,"Mast cells (MCs) are a potent proangiogenic factor in tumors, they product several pro- angiogenic factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF), tryptase and chymase. Tryptase is a serine protease classified as Î±-tryptase and Î²-tryptase, both produced by MCs. Tryptase degrades the tissues, playing an important role in angiogenesis and in the development of metastases. Serum tryptase increases with age, with increased damage to cells and risk of developing a malignancy and it could be considered the expression of a fundamental role of MCs in tumor growth or, on the contrary, in the antitumor response. Many biomarkers have been developed in clinical practice for improving diagnosis and prognosis of some neoplasms. Elevated tryptase levels are found in subgroups of patients with haematologic and solid cancers. In the current review, we want to update the perspectives of tryptase as a potential biomarker in daily practice in different neoplasms.",Italy,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",29192477,2017,Mast cells and cancer: a review of literature.,n
90,"The chemical compatibility between electrolytes and electrodes is an extremely important aspect governing the overall impedance of solid-oxide cells. Since these devices work at elevated temperatures, they are especially prone to cation interdiffusion between the cell components, possibly resulting in secondary insulating phases. In this work, we applied X-ray microspectroscopy to study the interface between a samarium-doped ceria electrolyte and lanthanum ferrite cathodes (La0.9Sr0.1Fe0.85Cu0.15O3 - LSCF; La0.4Sr0.6Fe0.8Co0.2O3 - LSFCu), at a submicrometric level. This technique allows to combine the information about the diffusion profiles of cations on the scale of several micrometers, together with the chemical information coming from space-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In SDC-LSCF bilayers, we find that the prolonged thermal treatments at 1150 Â°C bring about the segregation of samarium and iron in micrometer-sized perovskite domains. In both SDC-LSCF and SDC-LSFCu bilayers, cerium diffuses into the cathode perovskite lattice A-site as a reduced Ce3+ cation, while La3+ is easily incorporated in the ceria lattice, reaching 30 at.% in the ceria layer in contact with LSFCu.",United States,ACS applied materials & interfaces,29192487,2017,Cation diffusion and segregation at the interface between samarium-doped ceria and LSCF or LSFCu cathodes investigated with X-ray microspectroscopy.,n
91,"The emergence of a rich variety of layered materials has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their exciting properties. However, the applications of layered materials in optoelectronic devices are hampered by the low light absorption for mono-/few-layers, the lack of p-n junction, and the challenges for large-scale production. Here, we report a scalable production of Î²-In2Se3/Si heterojunction array using pulsed-laser deposition. Photodetectors based on the as-produced heterojunction array are sensitive to a broadband wavelength from ultraviolet (370 nm) to near-infrared (808 nm), showing a high responsivity (5.9 A/W), a decent current on/off ratio (~600), and a superior detectivity (4.9*1012 Jones) simultaneously. These figures-of-merits are among the best values of the reported heterojunction-based photodetectors. In addition, these devices can further enable the detection of weak signals, as successfully demonstrated with weak light sources including a flashlight, lighter and fluorescent light. Device physics modeling shows that their high performance is attributed to the strong light absorption of the relatively thick Î²-In2Se3 film and the rational energy band structures of Î²-In2Se3 and Si, which allows efficient separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. These results offer a new insight into the rational design of optoelectronic devices from the synergetic effect of layered materials as well as mature semiconductor technology.",United States,ACS applied materials & interfaces,29192488,2017,Self-assembly High-Performance UV-vis-NIR Broadband Î²-In2Se3/Si Photodetector Array for Weak Signal Detection.,n

The strategy employs spherical and cylindrical micelles, which are formed by controlled solution self-assembly of block copolymers, as the soft templates for the construction of well-defined spherical and cylindrical mesopores in the 2D PANi/MoS2 nanocomposites, respectively. With a potential application as supercapacitor electrode materials, the resultant 2D composites show excellent capacitive performance with a maximum capacitance of 500 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, good rate performance, as well as outstanding stability for charge-discharge cycling.

This method increased its surface area by a factor of â‰ˆ 1440 in comparison with an original lithography-based prepared array.

However, blue emission from perovskite QDs with strong quantum confinement is rarely reported and suffers from lower luminescence efficiency. Here we report blue-emitting ultrasmall (~3 nm) CsPbBr3 QDs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield as high as 68%. Using time-resolved and steady-state PL spectroscopy, we elucidate the mechanism of the highly efficient PL as recombination of excitons localized in radiative band tail states. Through analyzing the spectral-dependent PL lifetime and the PL lineshape, we obtain a large band tail width of ~80 meV and a high density of state of ~1020 cm-3.

This not only adversely impacts their much desired properties, but also is a roadblock for their applications. Here, we introduce diazonium molecule functionalization based surface engineering route that greatly enhances their environmental stability without sacrificing their much desired properties. Spectroscopy and microscopy results show that diazonium groups significantly slow down the surface reactions, and consequently gallium telluride (GaTe), zirconium telluride (ZrTe3) and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) gain strong resistance to surface transformation in air or when immersed under water. Density functional theory calculations show functionalizing molecules reduces surface reactivity of Te-containing 2D surfaces by chemical binding followed by electron withdrawal process. While pristine surfaces structurally decompose due to strong reactivity of Te surface atoms, passivated functionalized surfaces retain their structural anisotropy, optical band gap, and emission characteristics as evidenced by our conductive AFM, PL and absorption spectroscopy measurements.

Because integral membrane proteins are difficult targets for conventional structural biology, we recently developed a MS footprinting method to probe membrane protein/drug interactions in live cells. This method can detect structural difference between apo and drug-bound states of membrane proteins, with the changes inferred from MS quantification of the cysteine modification pattern, generated by residue-specific chemical labeling. Here, we describe the experimental design, interpretation, advantages, and limitations of using cysteine footprinting by taking as an example the warfarin interaction with vitamin K epoxide reductase, a human membrane protein. Compared with other structural methods, footprinting of proteins in live cells produces structural information for the near-native state. Knowledge of cellular conformational states is a necessary complement to the high-resolution structures obtained from purified proteins in vitro.

To characterize the mechanism underlying maize salt tolerance, we compared the seedling root proteomes of salt-tolerant Jing724 and salt-sensitive D9H. The germination rate and growth parameter values (weight and length) were higher for Jing724 than for D9H under saline conditions. Using an iTRAQ-based method, we identified 513 differentially regulated proteins (DRPs), with 83 and 386 DRPs specific to Jing724 and D9H, respectively. In salt-stressed Jing724, the DRPs were primarily associated with the pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. Key DRPs, such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, NADPH-producing dehydrogenase, glutamate synthase, and glutamine synthetase, were identified based on pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses. Moreover, salt-responsive proteins in Jing724 seedlings were implicated in energy management, maintenance of redox homeostasis, detoxification of ammonia, regulation of osmotic homeostasis, stress defense and adaptation, biotic cross-tolerance, and regulation of gene expression. Quantitative analyses of superoxide dismutase activity, malondialdehyde content, relative electrolyte leakage, and proline content were consistent with the predicted changes based on DRP functions.

Therefore, we examined the impacts of mineral surfaces (goethite and Î³-Al2O3) and organic matter (Suwannee River Fulvic Acid, SRFA) on Fe(II) oxidation rates and the resulting Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides under 21% and 1% pO2 at pH 6. We tracked Fe dynamics by adding 57Fe(II) to 56Fe-labeled goethite and Î³-Al2O3, and characterized the resulting solids using 57Fe MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy. We found Fe(II) oxidation was slower at low pO2 and resulted in higher crystallinity Fe(III) phases. Relative to oxidation of Fe(II)(aq) alone, both goethite and Î³-Al2O3 surfaces increased Fe(II) oxidation rates regardless of pO2 levels, with goethite the stronger catalyst. Goethite surfaces promoted well-crystalline goethite formation, while Î³-Al2O3 favored goethite and some lepidocrocite, and oxidation of Fe(II)aq alone favored lepidocrocite. SRFA reduced oxidation rates in all treatments except mineral-free systems at 21% pO2 and decreased Fe(III) phase crystallinity, facilitating low-crystalline ferrihydrite in the absence of mineral sorbents, low-crystalline lepidocrocite in the presence of Î³-Al2O3, but either well-crystalline goethite or ferrihydrite when goethite was present.

As the use of electronic cigarettes rises, more reports of injuries related to device explosion are surfacing.


METHODS
Presented here is the case of a 35-year-old man sustaining extensive thermal and blast injuries to his hand when the device exploded while he was holding it. He required multiple surgeries involving groin flap coverage, tendon transfer, and nerve grafting to optimize his postinjury function.


RESULTS
While much of his hand function has been restored, he has continued deficits in range of motion and sensation as a result of the incident.


CONCLUSIONS
With increasing numbers of such injuries, hand surgeons must be aware of the blast mechanism involved so as to avoid missing deep soft tissue injury or disruption of deep structures, as demonstrated in this case.",United States,"Hand (New York, N.Y.)",29192506,2017,Extensive Hand Thermal and Blast Injury From Electronic Cigarette Explosion: A Case Report.,n

Subjective tinnitus is a phantom sensation experienced without any external source of sound that profoundly impacts the quality of life. Some investigations have claimed that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces tinnitus, but studies on tDCS have demonstrated variable results. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of tDCS on patients with tinnitus.


METHODS
We searched for articles published through January 5, 2016, in Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar using the following keywords: tinnitus, transcranial direct current stimulation, and tDCS. The study outcomes were change in magnitude estimates of loudness (loudness), tinnitus-related distress (distress), and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI).


RESULTS
Pooled results demonstrated that tDCS did not have a beneficial effect on loudness (pooled standardized difference in means = 0.674, 95% CI, -0.089 to 1.437, P = .083). Further, the pooled results demonstrated a greater reduction in distress for the tDCS group (pooled standardized difference in means = 0.634, 95% CI, 0.021-1.247, P = .043).

112,"BACKGROUND
Calcaneal osteotomy has been used to successfully treat both valgus and varus hindfoot deformities. Pain associated with implanted hardware may lead to further surgical intervention for hardware removal. Headless screws have been used to reduce postoperative hardware-associated pain and accompanying hardware removal, but data proving their effectiveness in this regard is lacking. The purpose of this study is to compare the rates of removal of headed and headless screws utilized in calcaneal osteotomy.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective chart review of 74 patients who underwent calcaneal osteotomy between January 2010 and December 2014. The cohort was divided into 2 groups by fixation method: a headed screw and a headless screw group. Bivariate associations between infection or hardware removal, and screw type, screw head width, gender, smoking status, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, age, and body mass index were assessed using t-tests and Fisher's exact/Ï‡2 tests for continuous and discrete variables, respectively.


RESULTS
Headed screws were removed more frequently than headless screws (P < .0001): 15 of 30 (50%) feet that received headed screws and 4 of 44 (9%) of feet that received headless screws underwent subsequent revision for screw removal. In all cases, screws were removed because of pain. The calcaneal union rate was 100% in both cohorts.


CONCLUSION
The rate of screw removal in calcaneal osteotomies is significantly lower in patients who receive headless screws than in those receiving headed screws.

The aim of this study was to reveal biodetoxification with the cell-free extracts of Rhodococcus erythropolis NI1 and Rhodococcus rhodochrous NI2, which have been already proved to detoxify AFB1. Extracellular matrices of cultures and also intracellular extracts were applied for detoxification. In both cases, media containing constitutively produced and AFB1-induced enzymes were tested, respectively. The pH tolerance of enzymes in the detoxification was examined at pH 7, 7.5, and 8. The remained genotoxicity was detected by SOS-Chromotest and the AFB1 concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. In the extracellular matrix, no reduction of genotoxicity was observed. However, detoxification was completed by intracellular enzymes. In intracellular extracts of both strains, genotoxicity was ceased by the constitutive enzymes within 6Â h but induced and constitutive enzymes collectively achieved this result within minutes.

114,"Engaging in enjoyable activities is an essential part of well-being, but people with dementia can find participation increasingly difficult. Motion-based technologies can provide meaningful engagement in a wide range of activities, but for people with dementia to take advantage of these devices requires a good understanding of how best to select and present these activities to this population. The objective of this study was to explore the use of motion-based technology (Xbox Kinect) as a group activity for people with dementia who attend adult day programmes. This qualitative study took place in an adult day programme for older adults with age-related challenges. Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰23) were observed while playing a digital bowling game presented on Xbox Kinect one hour per week for a period of 20 weeks, to capture naturalistic data. Field notes generated through observations were transcribed and analysed to identify emerging themes. The findings revealed three predominant themes which illustrate the potential of motion-based technology as a group activity for people with dementia who attend adult day programmes: (a) the importance of having a trained trainer, (b) learning versus mastery and (c) playing 'independently together'. People with dementia can learn to play games presented on motion-based technology and enjoy doing so. Furthermore, using the technology in a group setting fostered an encouraging and supportive environment which further contributed to the leisure experience.

115,"Background Apathy is prominent in persons with dementia and apathy assessment is challenging. It remains unclear who should conduct apathy assessments in long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). Methods This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant, and one licensed practical nurse or activity staff. Family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff rated the resident's apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results The results revealed that ratings conducted by certified nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (râ€‰=â€‰0.47, pâ€‰=â€‰.08). None of the other AES ratings among family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were significantly correlated. Discussion Family and clinical caregivers were incongruent on their AES ratings of apathy. It remains undetermined which rater provides the most valid AES rating for residents with dementia. Findings from this study further highlight challenges in rating apathy in this population.

116,"The acute hospital admission of patients with dementia is associated with poor outcome and higher costs. Much of our knowledge on how hospital stays are experienced by patients and staff is generated from short and fragmented data collections, in which the significance of knowledge about day-to-day care might be overlooked, and might partly explain why the poor outcome for this group of patients is not fully understood. This study used participant observation to follow patients with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards after fall incidents. To gather longitudinal data, patients were followed during day and evening shifts, from admission to discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The data showed that, despite having little specific knowledge about dementia care, staff were able to gather information about the patient's needs and wishes relevant to administrating medicine in a person-centred way. However, much of this valuable information was lost between shifts or became hidden among the overwhelming amount of information in electronic patient records. As a consequence, much of the knowledge about individual patients' needs and wishes had to be collected all over again at every shift.

119,"Angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2) is an inflammatory adipokine linking obesity to insulin resistance. Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, is a lifestyle intervention able to prevent obesity and diabetes but difficult to implement and maintain. Our objectives were to characterize a link between ANGPTL2 and intermittent fasting and to investigate whether the knockdown of ANGPTL2 reproduces the benefits of intermittent fasting on weight gain and insulin responsiveness in knockdown and wild-type littermates mice. Intermittent fasting, access to food ad libitum once every other day, was initiated at the age of three months and maintained for four months. Intermittent fasting decreased by 63% (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) gene expression of angptl2 in adipose tissue of wild-type mice. As expected, intermittent fasting improved insulin sensitivity (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and limited weight gain (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in wild-type mice. Knockdown mice fed ad libitum, however, were comparable to wild-type mice following the intermittent fasting regimen: insulin sensitivity and weight gain were identical, while intermittent fasting had no additional impact on these parameters in knockdown mice. Energy intake was similar between both wild-type fed intermittent fasting and ANGPTL2 knockdown mice fed ad libitum, suggesting that intermittent fasting and knockdown of ANGPTL2 equally lower feeding efficiency. These results suggest that the reduction of ANGPTL2 could be a useful and promising strategy to prevent obesity and insulin resistance, although further investigation of the mechanisms linking ANGPTL2 and intermittent fasting is warranted. Impact statement Intermittent fasting is an efficient diet pattern to prevent weight gain and improve insulin sensitivity. It is, however, a difficult regimen to follow and compliance is expected to be very low. In this work, we demonstrate that knockdown of ANGPTL2 in mice fed ad libitum mimics the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting on weight gain and insulin sensitivity in wild-type mice. ANGPTL2 is a cytokine positively associated with fat mass in humans, which inactivation in mice improves resistance to a high-fat metabolic challenge. This study provides a novel pathway by which IF acts to limit obesity despite equivalent energy intake.

This study aimed to develop and validate an in vitro dissolution method based on in silico-in vivo data to determine whether an in vitro-in vivo relationship could be established for rivaroxaban in immediate-release tablets.


SIGNIFICANCE
Oral drugs with high permeability but poorly soluble in aqueous media, such as the anticoagulant rivaroxaban, have a major potential to reach a high level of in vitro-in vivo relationship. Currently, there is no study on scientific literature approaching the development of RIV dissolution profile based on its in vivo performance.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Drug plasma concentration values were modelled using computer simulation with adjustment of pharmacokinetic properties. Those values were converted into drug fractions absorbed by the Wagner-Nelson deconvolution approach. Gradual and continuous dissolution of RIV tablets was obtained with a 30â€‰rpm basket on 50â€‰mM sodium acetate + 0.2% SDS, pH 6.5 medium. Dissolution was conducted for up to 180â€‰min. The fraction absorbed was plotted against the drug fraction dissolved, and a linear point-to-point regression (R2=0.9961) obtained.


CONCLUSIONS

To evaluate intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (APAP) vs. oral APAP use as adjunctive analgesics in cholecystectomy patients by comparing associated hospital length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, opioid use, and rates of nausea/vomiting, respiratory depression, and bowel obstruction.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Premier Database (1/2012 to 9/2015) including cholecystectomy patients who received either IV APAP or oral APAP. We estimated differences in LOS, hospitalization costs, mean daily morphine equivalent dose (MED), and potential opioid-related adverse events. We performed multivariable logistic regression for the binary outcomes and instrumental variable regressions, using the quarterly rate of IV APAP use for all hospitalizations by hospital as the instrument in two-stage least squares regressions for continuous outcomes. Models were adjusted for patient demographics, clinical risk factors, and hospital characteristics.


RESULTS
Among 61,017 cholecystectomy patients, 31,133 (51%) received IV APAP. Subjects averaged 51 and 57 years of age, respectively, in the IV and oral APAP cohorts. In our adjusted models, IV APAP was associated with 0.42 days shorter LOS (95% CI: -0.58 to -0.27; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), $1,045 lower hospitalization costs (95% CI: -$1,521 to -$569; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), 2â€‰mg lower average daily MED (95% CI: -3â€‰mg to -0.9â€‰mg; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0005), and lower rates of respiratory depression (odds ratio [OR]: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.97; pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) and nausea and vomiting (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.86; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).

To analyze the impact of measures undertaken to control brucellosis in the Republic of Macedonia on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the disease in humans.


METHODS
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients with brucellosis were retrospectively analyzed.

RESULTS
A drastic decrease of the number of cases of human brucellosis during the last period when compared to the first two ones (3.9 and 3.3 times lower, respectively) was evident. Patients from the third period were significantly older, with median age 41 years (range 4-73) vs. 31 years (3-77) and 34 years (1-74), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰.013). There were more males (86.6 vs. 73.6% and 63.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and the disease was more often acquired professionally (80.6 vs. 60.1% and 59.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.006).

The comparison between infliximab versus adalimumab achieved an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of â‚¬45,582/QALY, with a 0.900 QALYs difference of efficacy and an incremental cost of â‚¬41,036. Golimumab versus adalimumab reached an ICER of â‚¬2,175,992/QALY, with a difference of 0.001 QALY in efficacy and a raising cost to â‚¬2,611. The comparison between vedolizumab with adalimumab achieved an ICER of â‚¬90,532/QALY, 0.930 QALYs of difference and an increasing cost of â‚¬84,218. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that adalimumab would be cost-effective in the 65.2% of the simulations, infliximab in the 18.4%, golimumab in the 16.4% and vedulizumab for the 0%.

Among all these drugs studied, adalimumab is the most cost-effective drug for the treatment of moderate to severe UC for a threshold of â‚¬30,000/QALY in Spain.",England,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,29192530,2017,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and vedolizumab for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Spain.",n
134,"As integration of nanoparticles (NPs) into products becomes more common, the need to address the paucity of chronic hazard information for aquatic environments required to determine risk potential increases. This study generated acute and chronic toxicity reference values for Ceriodaphnia dubia exposed to 20 and 100â€‰nm silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to generate and evaluate potential differences in acute-to-chronic ratios (ACR) using two different feeding methods. A modified feeding procedure was employed alongside the standard procedures to investigate the influence of food on organism exposure. An 8-h period before food was added allowed direct organism exposure to NP dispersions (and associated ions) without food-to-NP interactions. The AgNPs [chronic lethal median concentrations (LC50) between 18.7 and 31.9â€‰Âµg/L] were substantially more toxic than AuNPs (LC50â€‰=â€‰21Â 507 to >26Â 384â€‰Âµg/L). The modified chronic testing method resulted in greater sensitivity in AgNPs exposures. However, the modified feeding ration had less of an effect in exposures to the larger (100â€‰nm) AgNPs compared to smaller particles (20â€‰nm). The ACRs for AgNPs using the standard feeding ration were 1.6 and 3.5 for 20â€‰nm and 100â€‰nm, respectively. The ACRs for AgNPs using the modified feeding ration were 3.4 and 7.6 for 20â€‰nm and 100â€‰nm NPs, respectively. This supports that the addition of the standard feeding ration decreases C. dubia chronic sensitivity to AgNPs, although it must also be recognized organisms may be sensitized due to less access to food. The ACRs for 20â€‰nm and 100â€‰nm AuNPs (standard ration only) were 4.0 and 3.0, respectively. It is important to also consider that dissolved Ag+ ions are more toxic than AgNPs, based on both acute toxicity values in the cited literature and chronic toxicity thresholds generated in this study that support existing thresholds that Ag+ are likely protective of AgNPs effects.",England,Nanotoxicology,29192531,2017,"Comparison of acute to chronic ratios between silver and gold nanoparticles, using Ceriodaphnia dubia.",n
136,"BACKGROUND
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) survivors are at a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).


METHODS
A population-based study was conducted to investigate the cardiovascular mortality trends to identify NHL survivors at the highest risk.


RESULTS
The CVDs mortality was the second most common cause of death (13.07%) after NHL. There were more patients â‰¥ 60 years old in the cardiovascular group (87.2%), P < 0.001. Patients who died from CVDs had the best survival while patients who died from NHL had a significantly lower mean survival. The overall survival rate was 92.4%. Consistently, older age, unmarried, male patients, not recently diagnosed with NHL and not receiving radiation and/or surgery were associated with a worse survival across all models. The black race and stage IV only had a worse cardiovascular specific survival (CVSS).


CONCLUSIONS
Although the CVSS improved over time, the mortality from the CVDs is still the second most common cause of death after NHL. Older age, not married, black, male patients, not recently diagnosed with NHL, with an advanced stage and not receiving radiation and/or surgery were associated with a worse survival.

137,"BACKGROUND
Patients with brain lesions and resultant chronic aphasia frequently suffer from depression. However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial).


METHODS
In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test).


RESULTS
Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192534,2017,Intensive Communicative Therapy Reduces Symptoms of Depression in Chronic Nonfluent Aphasia.,y
138,"BACKGROUND
Patients with neglect ignore or respond slower to contralesional stimuli. Neglect negatively influences independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most frequently studied treatments, yet there is little evidence regarding positive effects on neglect behavior in ADL.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether PA in the subacute phase ameliorates neglect in situations of varying complexity.


METHODS
A total of 70 neglect patients admitted for inpatient stroke rehabilitation received either PA or sham adaptation (SA) for 2 weeks, with full access to standard treatment. There were 7 time-dependent measurements (baseline and 1-4, 6, and 14 weeks after start of treatment). The primary outcome was change of neglect as observed during basic ADL with the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in performance on a dynamic multitask (ie, the Mobility Assessment Course [MAC]) and a static paper-and-pencil task (ie, a shape cancellation task [SC]).


RESULTS
In all, 34 patients received PA and 35 SA. There were significant time-dependent improvements in performance as measured with the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F > 15.57; P < .001). There was no significant difference in magnitude of improvement between groups on the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F < 2.54; P > .113].


CONCLUSIONS
No beneficial effects of PA over SA in the subacute phase poststroke were observed, which was comparable for situations of varying complexity. Heterogeneity of the syndrome, time post-stroke onset, and the content of treatment as usual are discussed. Basic knowledge on subtypes and recovery patterns would aid the development of tailored treatment.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192535,2017,Prism Adaptation in Rehabilitation?

141,"Families of children with cancer are confronted with unexpected out-of-pocket expenses and productivity costs associated with the diagnosis. One productivity cost that falls on children is the impact of cancer on children's school attendance, performance, and activities (eg, play, friendships, and socialization). Nested within the Childhood Cancer Cost Study, this qualitative descriptive study used convenience sampling to recruit and interview parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer. Content analysis techniques were used to inductively descriptive the semistructured interview data. Sixty-six parents of 65 children with cancer and of 73 siblings participated. The most commonly reported productivity loss in children with cancer was school absenteeism mainly due to cancer treatment. Children fell behind their classmates academically and lost important social time with peers. A few siblings also fell behind their peers primarily due to limited parental attention. Parents adopted various strategies to lessen the impact of the diagnosis on their children's school attendance, performance, and activities.

142,"Murine chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) results in white matter (WM) injury and behavioral deficits. Pericytes influence blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and cerebral blood flow. Under hypoxic conditions, pericytes detach from perivascular locations increasing vessel permeability and neuronal injury.

Mice underwent BCAS or sham operation. On post-procedure days 1, 3, 7 and 30, corpus callosum BBB permeability was characterized using Evans blue (EB) extravasation and IgG staining and pericyte coverage/count was calculated. The BCAS cohort demonstrated increased EB extravasation on postoperative days 1 ( pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) 3 ( pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), and 7 ( pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) when compared to sham mice. Further, EB extravasation was significantly greater ( pâ€‰=â€‰0.05) at day 3 than at day 30 in BCAS mice. BCAS mice demonstrated a nadir in pericyte coverage and count on post-operative day 3 ( pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, compared to day 7, day 30 and sham).

The participants executed two breathing manoeuvres while sitting motionless: quiet breathing (QB) and vital capacity (VC). The 3D coordinates of 32 retro-reflective markers positioned on the trunk were used to calculate the volume of the superior thorax, inferior thorax and abdomen. Principal component analysis was applied in the volume variation of each trunk compartment to search for dominant independent variables in a breathing motion pattern. The correlation coefficient was calculated to verify the coordination between the compartments during the breathing manoeuvres. A predominance of the superior thorax or abdomen movement was found in both groups. The professional ballet dancers have an efficient breathing pattern and maintain the same breathing pattern in QB and VC manoeuvres.

145,"Occupational kneeling is associated with an increased risk for tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis. Forces on the knee in the kneeling posture, as well as the greater incidence of meniscus tears among workers likely contribute to the increased risk. We hypothesize that an additional mechanism may contribute - altered neuromuscular control due to prolonged high knee flexion. Forty participants (20 male, 20 female) completed an evaluation of gait and squatting before, immediately following, and 30 minutes following a 30-minute simulated occupational kneeling exposure. An increase in the peak external knee adduction moment and a delay in vastus medialis activation onset during walking was observed post-kneeling, as well as increased frontal plane knee motion during squatting. This was the first investigation to find changes in high flexion transitions as a result of kneeling. Greater frontal plane knee motion may increase the risk for meniscal tears, and subsequently, knee osteoarthritis. Practitioner Summary A 30-minute simulated occupational kneeling exposure resulted in small but significant gait changes. The greatest effect was on frontal plane knee movement during squatting, which is especially relevant to occupations requiring frequent kneeling/squatting. This increased motion may indicate an increased risk of injury, which supports a link to knee osteoarthritis.",England,Ergonomics,29192542,2017,The effects of a simulated occupational kneeling exposure on squat mechanics and knee joint load during gait.,n
148,"Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate the cardiorespiratory effects, quality of sedation and recovery of intramuscular alfaxalone-dexmedetomidine-butorphanol (ADB) and ketamine-dexmedetomidine-butorphanol (KDB), in cats. Methods Nine adult, healthy cats (6.63 Â± 1.42 kg) were enrolled in a blinded, randomized, crossover experimental design. Cats were sedated twice intramuscularly, once with ADB (alfaxalone 1 mg/kg, dexmedetomidine 0.005 mg/kg, butorphanol 0.2 mg/kg), and once with KDB (ketamine 5 mg/kg, dexmedetomidine 0.005 mg/kg, butorphanol 0.2 mg/kg), in random order. Data collected included heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure and blood gas analysis, respiratory rate, and sedation score. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc correction was used for parametric data, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for non-parametric data. Significance was set at P <0.05. Results Total sedation time was shorter for ADB (90.71 Â± 15.12 mins vs 147.00 Â± 47.75 mins). Peak sedation was observed within 15 mins in both groups. Quality of recovery was excellent in both groups. HR decreased over time in both groups. Diastolic and mean arterial pressure decreased over time for ADB, becoming significant after 30 mins. All cardiovascular variables were within the clinically acceptable range in both groups. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen was significantly decreased from baseline for KDB at all time points (73 Â± 2.5 mmHg [9.7 Â± 0.3 kPa] vs ADB 83 Â± 2.6 mmHg [11 Â± 0.3 kPa]).

However, visualisation of part of the bile duct using ultrasonography can be technically difficult if there is overlying bowel gas. This study investigated the safety and value of drip infusion cholangiography with computed tomography (DIC-CT) in the visualisation of the bile duct in healthy cats and extrahepatic biliary obstruction in cats with cholelithiasis. Methods DIC-CT was performed in three healthy cats and two cats with cholelithiasis. Meglumine iotroxate was administered by intravenous drip infusion over 30 mins. The attenuation value was measured perpendicular to the lumen by a region of interest covering about 50% of the area of the lumen. Results The bile ducts were visualised successfully with DIC-CT in all healthy cats without any significant adverse events. The attenuation value of the contrast medium was 271 Â± 37 HU. In the two cats with cholelithiasis, the presence or absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction was determined using DIC-CT without any significant adverse events. The attenuation value of cholelithiasis in the cat with an extrahepatic biliary obstruction was 933 Â± 119 HU. In the cat with no extrahepatic biliary obstruction, the attenuation value of the contrast medium was 249 Â± 53 HU and the attenuation value of cholelithiasis was 167 Â± 28 HU.

Each group received two screws (WE4 and titanium as a standard material) in artificially drilled defect into right tibia. Animals were euthanized at four-week intervals. Bone samples with implants underwent microfocus CT scans and were histologically examined. Results WE43 alloys showed fragmentation of the material on the 16th week - statistically significant volume loss was found between weeks 12 and 16. Bone healing around the WE43 screws was of similar quality as around titanium screws, and no adverse effect was noticed. Conclusion The study showed good quality of bone healing around WE43 implants.

Simultaneous usage of proximal and distal segments as seen in martial arts is by far less well investigated. Therefore, the aim of the study was to characterise and differentiate the concepts of consecutive (CSM) and simultaneous (SSM) sequence of motion in straight reverse punches as practised in Practical Wing Chun. Four experienced martial artists succeeded an eligibility test for technical proficiency in both concepts and performed a total number of 20 straight punches per concept. Eight MX13 Vicon cameras (250Â fps) and Visual3D were used for motion capture and analyses. Both motion concepts showed proximal-to-distal sequencing of maximal joint velocities but, in SSM, this was coupled with simultaneous initiation. Key characteristics were: high pelvis momentum and backswing of shoulder and elbow (CSM); and importance of shoulder involvement (SSM). Different ranges of motion, timing aspects and achieved maximal angular velocities distinguished both concepts, which led to differences (pÂ <Â 0.05) in fist velocity at contact, execution time, distance and horizontal shift of the centre of mass.

Although many such derivatives showed low nanomolar activity in vitro, they were inefficient anti-T. cruzi agents in vivo. Here, we show that by formulating such sulfonamides as nanoemulsions in clove (Eugenia caryophyllus) oil, highly efficient anti-protozoan effects are observed against two different strains of T. cruzi. These effects are probably due to an enhanced permeation of the enzyme inhibitor through the nanoemulsion formulation, interfering in this way with the life cycle of the pathogen either by inhibiting pH regulation or carboxylating reactions in which bicarbonate/CO2 are involved.

159,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are easily contaminated by bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). The presence of LPS can be responsible for many immune/inflammatory effects attributed to NPs. In this study, we examined the effects of LPS adsorption on the NP surface on the formation of a biocorona in biological fluids and on the subsequent inflammation-inducing activity of NPs. Different gold (Au) NPs with sizes ranging from 10 to 80â€‰nm and with different surface functionalization (sodium citrate, lipoic acid, and branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI), or polyethylene glycol (PEG)) were exposed to E. coli LPS under different conditions. The binding capacity of LPS to the surface of AuNPs was dose- and time-dependent. LPS attached to sodium citrate and lipoic acid coatings, but did not adhere to BPEI- or PEG-coated NPs. By computational simulation, the binding of LPS to AuNPs seems to follow the Langmuir absorption isotherm. The presence of LPS on AuNP surface interfered and caused a decrease in the formation of the expected biomolecular corona upon incubation in human plasma. LPS-coated AuNPs, but not the LPS-free NPs, induced significant inflammatory responses in vitro. Notably, while free LPS did also induce an anti-inflammatory response, LPS bound to NPs appeared unable to do so. In conclusion, the unintentional adsorption of LPS onto the NP surface can affect the biocorona formation and the inflammatory properties of NPs. Thus, for an accurate interpretation of NP interactions with cells, it is extremely important to be able to distinguish the intrinsic NP biological effects from those caused by biologically active contaminants such as endotoxin.",England,Nanotoxicology,29192556,2017,"Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) binds to the surface of gold nanoparticles, interferes with biocorona formation and induces human monocyte inflammatory activation.",n
162,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Several mouse models for IBD are available, but the acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model is mostly used for preclinical studies. However, this model lacks chronicity and often leads to significant loss of mice. The aim of this study was to establish a refined and translationally relevant model of DSS chronic colitis in BALB/c mice. In the first part, we compared several standard therapeutic (ST) treatments for IBD in the acute DSS colitis model to identify the optimal treatment control for a DSS colitis model as compared to literature data. In the second part, we tested the two most effective ST treatments in a refined model of chronic DSS colitis. Cyclosporine A (CsA) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG) caused considerable reduction of clinical scores in acute DSS colitis. The clinical outcome was confirmed by the results for colon length and by histopathological evaluation. Moreover, CsA and 6-TG considerably reduced mRNA expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in spleen and colon. Both compounds also showed a substantial therapeutic effect in the refined model of chronic DSS colitis with regard to clinical scores and histopathology as well as the expression of inflammatory markers.

169,"OBJECTIVE
To examine changes in breastfeeding rates in 0 to 6 month old infants in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, over the period from 2009 to 2015, for the total population as well as for various ethnic groups.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHOD
Breastfeeding rates were examined for the period from 2009 to 2015 in 165,420 registrations of 75,543 infants at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for the entire Amsterdam population and for various ethnic groups. Differences were analysed using Ï‡2 tests.


RESULTS
The weighted percentage of total breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding as well as a combination of breast and formula feeding) increased in the entire Amsterdam study population over the period from 2009 to 2015 (2 weeks: 87.8% to 89.1%; 3 months: 61.6% to 63.6%; 6 months: 39.5% to 42.2%). Increases were mainly the result of increases in weighted percentages for exclusive breastfeeding. The highest exclusive breastfeeding rates were observed among the Turkish ethnic group, the lowest among the Antillean/Aruban and Surinamese groups.


CONCLUSION
Percentages for total breastfeeding as well as exclusive breastfeeding in Amsterdam rose over the period from 2009 to 2015, but there is room for improvement. Breastfeeding promotion, whether or not in combination with formula feeding, may be of particular benefit to children of Surinam or Antillean/Aruban descent.

To determine the result of the assessment procedure, initiated on 1 December 2005, for physicians with a foreign diploma who wish to practice in the Netherlands.


DESIGN
Retrospective, descriptive study.


METHOD
The Commission for Foreign Healthcare Graduates (CBGV) collected data on physicians with a foreign diploma who followed the procedure for requesting a declaration of professional competence and admission to the Dutch Individual Healthcare Professions (BIG) register between December 2005 - December 2015. The procedure comprises a language and communication test, followed by tests of professional competence. On the grounds of the test results, the CBGV can decide if a physician should follow a specific training course. The number of physicians who ultimately obtained BIG registration was determined.


RESULTS
During the study period, 183 of the 206 physicians with a foreign diploma passed the general knowledge and skills tests. A total of 176 of the 183 physicians took the professional competence tests. In 43 (25%) of them no shortcomings in knowledge and skills were seen. They were registered in the BIG register for a period of supervision. In 129 (73%), shortfalls were made up by means of focused training programme. In 4 (2%) of them no training was possible. On the date of assessment, 137 (78%) physicians were registered. This number is expected to rise to 151 (86%).


CONCLUSION
The provision of a further course of training that is focused on the elimination of identified shortcomings in physicians with a foreign diploma, increases the percentage of foreign physicians that are successfully admitted to the BIG register.",Netherlands,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,29192567,2017,[Assessment of physicians with a foreign diploma; results of 10 years of testing of physicians with a foreign diploma].,n

To determine the degree of agreement between delirium experts on the diagnosis of delirium based on exactly the same information, and to assess the sensitivity of delirium screening methods used by clinical nurses.


DESIGN
Prospective observational longitudinal study.


METHOD
Older patients (â‰¥ 60 years) who underwent major surgery were included. During the first three days after surgery they had a standardised cognitive screening test which was recorded on video. Two delirium experts independently evaluated these videos and the information from the patient records. They classified the patients as having 'no delirium', 'possible delirium' or 'delirium'. If there was disagreement, a third expert was consulted. The final classification, based on consensus of two or three delirium experts, was compared with the result of the delirium screening carried out by the clinical nurses.


RESULTS
A total of 167 patients were included and 424 postoperative classifications were obtained. The agreement between the experts was 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.68), based on Cohen's kappa. In 89 (21.0%) of the postoperative classifications there was no agreement between the experts and a third expert was consulted. The nurses using the delirium screening tools recognised 32% of the cases that had been classified as delirium by the experts.


CONCLUSION
There was considerable disagreement between the classifications of individual delirium experts, based on exactly the same information, indicating the difficulty of the diagnosis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the delirium screening tools used by the clinical nurses was poor.

This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs.

Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012.

190,"BACKGROUND
Catheter ablation (CA) of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is an effective treatment. However, the frequency of asymptomatic AF recurrence after CA in patients with PAF and sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is not clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the real AF recurrence after CA in patients with PAF and a pacemaker for SSS.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Fifty-one consecutive patients (mean age 66.6Â Â±Â 7.0 years, male 34) with PAF and SSS and pacemakers underwent CA. All patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the CA using a 12-lead ECG, Holter-ECG, and 1-month event recorder as a conventional follow-up. In addition, the pacemakers were interrogated every 12 months. During a 5-year follow-up after the final CA procedure, AF recurrences were observed in 7 patients (13.7%) with a conventional follow-up, including 1 (2.0%) asymptomatic patient. Pacemaker-interrogation revealed another 10 patients (19.6%) with asymptomatic AF recurrences. Ultimately, the conventional follow-up plus pacemaker-interrogation provided a higher incidence of AF recurrences (PÂ =Â 0.009). Multiple CA procedures contributed to a significant increase in the AF-free survival rate at 5 years: 58.6% after a single CA and 86.0% after multiple CA procedures with a conventional follow-up, but which decreased to 40.6% and 60.9% with a conventional follow-up plus a pacemaker interrogation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
One-third of PAF patients with SSS and pacemakers recurred after multiple CA sessions. However, 65% of them were asymptomatic and difficult to be identified with conventional follow-up.

192,"INTRODUCTION
Limited data exists for types of venous closure and its associated complications in patients after atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation. We evaluated the subcutaneous figure-of-eight closure (FO8) for achieving venous hemostasis after AF catheter ablation compared to manual pressure.


METHODS
284 consecutive patients that underwent AF catheter ablation by two operators were included. All patients received continuous therapeutic warfarin or interrupted novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) and heparin (ACT300-400Â s) without reversal. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) sheaths were left in place and pulled once ACTÂ <Â 180Â s, with hemostasis being achieved with manual pressure (MP); and 2) a subcutaneous FO8 suture closed the venous access site immediately after the ablation on each groin site and sheaths were removed immediately after the ablation despite full anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin or interrupted NOAC. Sutures were removed after four hours, and the patients laid flat for an additional two hours.


RESULTS
The MP group (nÂ =Â 105) was similar to the FO8 group (nÂ =Â 179). Time in bed was 573Â Â±Â 80Â min for MP group vs. 373Â Â±Â 49Â min for FO8 group (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Eleven hematomas were seen in the MP group compared to seven in the FO8 group (PÂ =Â 0.041).


CONCLUSIONS
In fully anticoagulated patients undergoing AF catheter ablation, excellent hemostasis was achieved with figure-of-eight sutures, with no major vascular complications, a lower hematoma rate, and a significantly shorter flat-time-in-bed compared to manual pressure.",Netherlands,Indian pacing and electrophysiology journal,29192589,2017,Figure-of-eight suture for venous hemostasis in fully anticoagulated patients after atrial fibrillation catheter ablation.,n

The incidence of electrical storm (ES) has been increasing with the rise of the indicated uses of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). It is estimated that 20% of patients will evolve to have this complication. Ablative therapy stands out as the treatment for this condition when it is refractory to antiarrhythmic treatment. The objective was to define the current role of catheter ablation in the treatment of electrical storm.


METHODS
An integrative literature review was performed using the PubMed and BVS databases. All identified articles were screened and verified for eligibility by the authors.


RESULTS
Twenty-five out of the initial 951 articles were used in the final analysis. The categories listed for analysis included indication for ablation in ES, modality of the approach, therapeutic success, complications related to the procedure, mortality and cardiovascular follow-up and alternative therapeutic modalities by frequency of these categories in the articles researched.

Nethertheless, this analysis is not possible in about 25% of cases and the development of alternative methods is therefore required. Among them, the search for mutations directly in the blood of patients are promising approaches. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent a particularly relevant direct target. These cells, some of them have inducing-metastasis capabilities, have been able to detach themselves from the primary tumor, then migrate and finally enter into the bloodstream. In this sense, they are particularly resistant to physical-chemical and immunological constraints used by the organism to prevent their dissemination. Consequently, they represent a particularly valuable source of information on the most aggressive tumor cells. As a corollary, these cells are very rare requiring particularly highly performant technologies to be detected.

200,"The management of metastatic melanoma has evolved since the onset of treatments with BRAF inhibitors. In order to predict which patients are likely to respond to these treatments, the therapeutic strategy is now conditioned by the search for the activating mutations of the BRAF gene. Tumor genotyping is routinely performed from DNA extracted from tissue or cellular specimens from the primary tumor, metastases, or neoplastic effusions. Due to their invasiveness, these specimens are rarely repeated during the management. In addition, the analysis of the tumor material requires a pretreatment of the sample (formalin fixation, paraffin inclusion, preparation of tissue sections) and may take up to several weeks, making emergency treatment with BRAF inhibitors impossible. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), released by cancer cells in the blood stream, appears as an alternative to tissue sampling. The pre-analytical conditions are now well defined, and several technological approaches can be used to demonstrate the desired molecular alterations. ctDNA is less affected by tumor heterogeneity, can be collected in a minimally invasive manner and analyzed rapidly.

Isolated bacteria come principally from the skin flora (>60%), but we also isolate potentially pathogenic micro-organisme like S. aureus, E. faecalis, A. viridans and Aspergillus sp. as well as oropharyngeal flora bacteria like A. iwolfii and M. osloensis and fecal like B. stercoris. Some species rarely described in hospital are also isolated such as P. yeei or K. sedentarius. The extraction efficiency of the sampling method on a magazine is 36%.

It uses non-additive modeling of the forward operator that provides intervals instead of single-valued projections. The detailed approach is an extension of the Maximum Likelihood - Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) algorithm based on intervals. The main motivation for this extension is that the resulting intervals have appealing properties for estimating the statistical uncertainty associated with the reconstructed activity values.

210,"OBJECTIVE
Regenerated peripheral nervous tissue possesses different morphometric properties compared to undisrupted nerve. It is poorly understood how these morphometric differences alter the response of the regenerated nerve to electrical stimulation. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the electrophysiological response of regenerated and undisrupted nerve axons to electrical stimulation delivered by macro-sieve electrodes (MSEs).


APPROACH
A 3D finite element model of a peripheral nerve segment populated with mammalian myelinated axons and implanted with a macro-sieve electrode has been developed. Fiber diameters and morphometric characteristics representative of undisrupted or regenerated peripheral nervous tissue were assigned to core conductor models to simulate the two tissue types. Simulations were carried out to quantify differences in thresholds and chronaxie between undisrupted and regenerated fiber populations. The model was also used to determine the influence of axonal caliber on recruitment thresholds for the two tissue types. Model accuracy was assessed through comparisons with in-vivo recruitment data from chronically implanted MSEs.


MAIN RESULTS
Recruitment thresholds of individual regenerated fibers with diameters &gt;2 Âµm were found to be lower compared to same caliber undisrupted fibers at electrode to fiber distances of less than about 90-140 Âµm but roughly equal or higher for larger distances. Caliber redistributions observed in regenerated nerve resulted in an overall increase in average recruitment thresholds and chronaxie during whole nerve stimulation. Modeling results also suggest that large diameter undisrupted fibers located close to a longitudinally restricted current source such as the MSE have higher average recruitment thresholds compared to small diameter fibers. In contrast, large diameter regenerated nerve fibers located in close proximity of MSE sites have, on average, lower recruitment thresholds compared to small fibers. Utilizing regenerated fiber morphometry and caliber distributions resulted in accurate predictions of in-vivo recruitment data.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our work uses computational modeling to show how morphometric differences between regenerated and undisrupted tissue results in recruitment threshold discrepancies, quantifies these differences, and illustrates how large undisrupted nerve fibers close to longitudinally restricted current sources have higher recruitment thresholds compared to adjacently positioned smaller fibers while the opposite is true for large regenerated fibers.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192607,2017,Modelling the impact of altered axonal morphometry on the response of regenerative nervous tissue to electrical stimulation through macro-sieve electrodes.,y
212,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this work is to improve the state of the art for motor-control with a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs use neurological recording devices and a decoding algorithms to transform brain activity directly into real-time control of a machine, archetypically a robotic arm or a cursor. The standard procedure treats neural activity--vectors of spike counts in small temporal windows--as noisy observations of the kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration) of the fingertip. Inferring the state from the observations then takes the form of a \emph{dynamical filter}, typically some variant on Kalman's (KF). The KF, however, although fairly robust in practice, is optimal only when the relationships between variables are linear and the noise is Gaussian, conditions usually violated in practice.


APPROACH
To overcome these limitations we introduce a new filter, the ""recurrent exponential-family harmonium"" (rEFH), that models the spike counts explicitly as Poisson-distributed, and allows for arbitrary nonlinear dynamics and observation models. Furthermore, the model underlying the filter is acquired through unsupervised learning, which allows temporal correlations in spike counts to be explained by latent dynamics that do not necessarily correspond to the kinematic state of the fingertip.


MAIN RESULTS
We test the rEFH on offline reconstruction of the kinematics of reaches in the plane. The rEFH outperforms the standard, as well as three other state-of-the-art, decoders, across three monkeys, two different tasks, most kinematic variables, and a range of bin widths, amounts of training data, and numbers of neurons.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our algorithm establishes a new state of the art for offline decoding of reaches---in particular, for fingertip velocities, the variable used for control in most online decoders.&#13.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192609,2017,"Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm.",y

214,"Daylight photodynamic therapy (dl-PDT) is as effective as conventional PDT (c-PDT) for treating actinic keratoses but has the advantage of reducing patient discomfort significantly. Topical dl-PDT and white light-PDT (wl-PDT) differ from c-PDT by way of light sources and methodology. We measured the variables associated with light dose delivery to skin surface and influence of geometry using a radiometer, a spectral radiometer and an illuminance meter. The associated errors of the measurement methods were assessed. The spectral and spatial distribution of the radiant energy from the LED white light source was evaluated in order to define the maximum treatment area, setup and treatment protocol for wl-PDT. We compared the data with two red LED light sources we use for c-PDT. The calculated effective light dose is the product of the normalised absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the irradiance spectrum and the treatment time. The effective light dose from daylight ranged from 3Â±0.4 to 44Â±6 J/cm2 due to varying weather conditions. The effective light dose for wl-PDT was reproducible for treatments but it varied across the treatment area between 4Â±0.1 J/cm2 at the edge and 9Â±0.1 J/cm2 centrally. The effective light dose for the red waveband (615-645 nm) was 0.42Â±0.05 J/cm2 on a clear day, 0.05Â±0.01 J/cm2 on an overcast day and 0.9Â±0.01 J/cm2 using the white light. This compares with 0.95Â±0.01 and 0.84Â±0.01 J/cm2 for c-PDT devices. Estimated errors associated with indirect determination of daylight effective light dose were very significant, particularly for effective light doses less than 5 J/cm2 (up to 83% for irradiance calculations). The primary source of error is in establishment of the relationship between irradiance or illuminance and effective dose.

216,"INTRODUCTION
This study examines the use of the number of night-time sleep disturbances as a health-based metric to assess the cost effectiveness of rail noise mitigation strategies for situations, wherein high-intensity noises dominate such as freight train pass-bys and wheel squeal.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty residential properties adjacent to the existing and proposed rail tracks in a noise catchment area of the Epping to Thornleigh Third Track project were used as a case study. Awakening probabilities were calculated for individual's awakening 1, 3 and 5 times a night when subjected to 10 independent freight train pass-by noise events using internal maximum sound pressure levels (LAFmax).


RESULTS
Awakenings were predicted using a random intercept multivariate logistic regression model. With source mitigation in place, the majority of the residents were still predicted to be awoken at least once per night (median 88.0%), although substantial reductions in the median probabilities of awakening three and five times per night from 50.9 to 29.4% and 9.2 to 2.7%, respectively, were predicted. This resulted in a cost-effective estimate of 7.6-8.8 less people being awoken at least three times per night per A$1 million spent on noise barriers.


CONCLUSION
The study demonstrates that an easily understood metric can be readily used to assist making decisions related to noise mitigation for large-scale transport projects.",India,Noise & health,29192613,2017,A Health-Based Metric for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Noise Barrier Mitigation Associated With Transport Infrastructure Noise.,y
217,"PURPOSE
To determine the accuracy of smart devices (iPods) to measure intermittent noise and integrate a noise dose in the workplace.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In experiment 1, four iPods were each paired with a Larson Davis Spark dosimeter and exposed to randomly fluctuating pink noise in a reverberant sound chamber. Descriptive statistics and the mean difference between the iPod and its paired dosimeter were calculated for the 1-s data logged measurements. The calculated time weighted average (TWA) was also compared between the devices. In experiment 2, 15 maintenance workers and 14 office workers wore an iPod and dosimeter during their work-shift for a maximum of five workdays. A mixed effects linear regression model was used to control for repeated measures and to determine the effect of the device type on the projected 8-h TWA.


RESULTS
In experiment 1, a total of 315,306 1-s data logged measurements were made. The interquartile range of the mean difference fell withinâ€‰Â±2.0 A-weighted decibels (dBA), which is the standard used by the American National Standards Institute to classify a type 2 sound level meter. The mean difference of the calculated TWA was withinâ€‰Â±0.5 dBA except for one outlier. In experiment 2, the results of the mixed effects model found that, on average, iPods measured an 8-h TWA 1.7 dBA higher than their paired dosimeters.


CONCLUSION
This study shows that iPods have the ability to make reasonably accurate noise measurements in the workplace, but they are not as accurate as traditional noise dosimeters.",India,Noise & health,29192614,2017,Using Smart Devices to Measure Intermittent Noise in the Workplace.,n
218,"CONTEXT
According to the attention restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors.


AIMS
By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50-min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40â€‰min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were re-tested. The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately re-tested. The difference between the two test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents the attention restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig.â€‰=â€‰0.027 (<0.050)].


RESULTS
The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95%) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8.4), 'traffic sounds group' (2.4) and 'machine sounds group' (-1.8).


CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, have a positive effect on the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration.",India,Noise & health,29192615,2017,Effects of Soundscape on the Environmental Restoration in Urban Natural Environments.,y

Hyperacusis is defined as a reduction in tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Hyperacusis can occur in individuals of all age groups, making daily life difficult for the sufferers. Although there is no objective test to accurately diagnose hyperacusis, questionnaires are useful for the assessment of hyperacusis. The aim of this study was to explore the reduced sound tolerance in university students using a hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 536 university students (300 females and 236 males) aged between 18 and 25 years, with a mean age of 21.34â€‰Â±â€‰1.87 years, were assessed using an HQ developed by Khalfa. The mean total score of all the participants was 16.34â€‰Â±â€‰7.91, and 5.78% of the participants had total scores indicating hyperacusis, where a majority of them were females.


RESULTS
Females had significantly higher scores than men in terms of both the total and the attentional and emotional dimensions. The scores of the participants who reported noise exposure or a decrease in their tolerance to noise were significantly higher than those of the other participants. Even among young adults, there was a group of participants suffering from some problems related to decreased tolerance to everyday sounds.


DISCUSSION
Although the Turkish translation of the HQ seems to be a reliable tool for evaluating hyperacusis in young adults, further work with various populations of different age groups is required to establish validity and to assess the psychometric qualities of the Turkish form.",India,Noise & health,29192616,2017,Assessment of Reduced Tolerance to Sound (Hyperacusis) in University Students.,y

Evaluation of the effect of low-frequency noise (LFN) on the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells and on the content of low-molecular-weight DNA (lmwDNA) in the blood plasma of rats.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 96 male Wistar rats were exposed to either single (17â€‰min session) or multiple (17â€‰min session repeated five times a week for 13 weeks) LFN, with the maximum range below 250â€‰Hz and the sound pressure levels (SPLs) at 120 and 150â€‰dB, respectively. The rats in the control groups were not subjected to any impact. The frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells and the levels of lmwDNA in the blood plasma were measured afterwards.


RESULTS
It has been detected that a single LFN exposure with either corresponding SPLs had a significant increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (more than 10-fold) compared to the controls (0.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.3%) and resulted in the appearance of dicentric chromosomes in the aberration spectrum, both of which are evident for the occurrence of deoxyribonucleic acid double strand breaks triggered by the exposure. Furthermore, the lmwDNA levels in the blood plasma measured the following day after a single LFN exposure were significantly higher (7.7- and 7.6-fold, respectively) than that in the control group (11.0â€‰Â±â€‰5.4â€‰ng/ml), and such levels were maintained higher (4.8- and 2.1-fold, respectively) in the week after a single LFN exposure for the SPL of 120 and 150â€‰dB, respectively, compared to the control group (18.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.6â€‰ng/ml). Similar results were obtained from the group with multiple LFN exposures (36.4- and 22.4-fold, respectively) compared to the control (17.7â€‰Â±â€‰1.7â€‰ng/ml) and suggest the enhancement of cellular apoptosis as a result of the LFN impact.


CONCLUSION
Presumably, the LFN may have possible mutagenic effects and cause massive cell death.",India,Noise & health,29192617,2017,The Effects of Low-Frequency Noise on Rats: Evidence of Chromosomal Aberrations in the Bone Marrow Cells and the Release of Low-Molecular-Weight DNA in the Blood Plasma.,n
221,"OBJECTIVE
Children's own ratings and opinions on their schools sound environments add important information on noise sources. They can also provide information on how to further improve and optimize children's learning situation in their classrooms. This study reports on the Swedish translation and application of an evidence-based questionnaire that measures how children perceive the acoustic environment of their school.


STUDY DESIGN
The Swedish version was made using a back-to-back translation. Responses on the questionnaire along with demographic data were collected for 149 children aged 9-13 years of age.


RESULTS
The Swedish translation of the questionnaire can be reduced from 93 to 27 items. The 27 items were distributed over five separate factors measuring different underlying constructs with high internal consistency and high inter-item correlations. The responses demonstrated that the dining hall/canteen and the corridors are the school spaces with the poorest listening conditions. The highest annoyance was reported for tests and reading; next, student-generated sounds occur more frequently within the classroom than any sudden unexpected sounds, and finally, road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms are the most frequently occurring sounds from outside the classroom. Several demographic characteristics could be used to predict the outcome on these factors.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that crowded spaces are most challenging; the children themselves generate most of the noise inside the classroom, but it is also common to hear road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms. The extent of annoyance that noise causes depends on the task but seems most detrimental in tasks, wherein the demands of verbal processing are higher.

The most common cause of tinnitus is the exposure to noise; in the case of adolescents, music is the main sound source they are exposed to. Currently, one of the hypotheses about the genesis of tinnitus is related to the deterioration in the functioning of the medial olivocochlear system (MOCS).


AIM
The aim of this study was to determine the presence or absence of tinnitus in adolescents with normal hearing and to relate it to: (a) the functioning of the MOCS, by the contralateral suppression of the transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and (b) the musical general exposure (MGE).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A cross-sectional descriptive correlational study was conducted. The sample was composed by adolescents with ages between 14 and 15. Two questionnaires were administered, one in relation to the subjective report of tinnitus and the other in relation to recreational activities to know the MGE.


RESULTS
The results showed that the amplitude of frequencies (1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000â€‰Hz) and global amplitude of TEOAEs, with and without acoustic contralateral stimulation, were higher in the group without tinnitus, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The suppressive effect was higher in the group without tinnitus; however, there was no statistically significant difference. Contrastingly, a significant association (P < 0.05) between exposure to music and tinnitus was observed; 72.41% of the adolescents with high exposure to music had tinnitus.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The results of the present investigation provide a contribution to the hypothesis of ""the participation of the MOCS.""

To survey current, Danish industrial noise levels and the use of hearing protection devices (HPD) over a 10-year period and to characterise the association between occupational noise and hearing threshold shift in the same period. Furthermore, the risk of hearing loss among the baseline and the follow-up populations according to first year of occupational noise exposure is evaluated.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In 2001-2003, we conducted a baseline survey of noise- and hearing-related disorders in 11 industries with suspected high noise levels. In 2009-2010, we were able to follow up on 271 out of the 554 baseline workers (49%). Mean noise levels per industry and self-reported HPD use are described at baseline and follow-up. The association between cumulative occupational noise exposure and hearing threshold shift over the 10-year period was assessed using linear regression, and the risk of hearing loss according to year of first occupational noise exposure was evaluated with logistic regression.


RESULTS
Over the 10-year period, mean noise levels declined from 83.9 dB(A) to 82.8 dB(A), and for workers exposed >85 dB(A), the use of HPD increased from 70.1 to 76.1%. We found a weak, statistically insignificant, inverse association between higher ambient cumulative noise exposure and poorer hearing (-0.10â€‰dB hearing threshold shift per dB-year (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36; 0.16)). The risk of hearing loss seemed to increase with earlier first year of noise exposure, but odds ratios were only statistically significant among baseline participants with first exposure before the 1980s (odds ratio: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11; 3.22).

Controversy regarding the best management strategy for subdural empyema (SDE) attests to the persisting poor outcomes for this uncommon life threatening intracranial suppurative process. Late presentation confounds the problem in developed countries. While craniotomy is commonly recommended, it is not always possible in late presentation with advanced morbidity. The aim of this study was to identify the pattern of clinical presentation and explore the outcomes following management of SDE using burr hole, aspiration, and drainage (BAAD) in resource poor settings.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 18 patients presenting with SDE over a period of 10 years from two neurosurgical centers. Data was abstracted on patients' demographic characteristics, sources of SDE, clinical presentation and site of infection, methods of diagnosis, organisms isolated, treatments received, and outcome. Collected data was entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17 software and subjected to descriptive analysis for all variables.


RESULTS
Majority of the patients presented late with Glasgow Coma Scale score GCS of 9/15. Altered sensorium was noted in 14 (77.8%) of the patients, 11 (61.1%) out of the 14 patients had â‰¤ grade 3 of Bannister and Williams level of consciousness. The mainstay of treatment for all patients was BAAD of abscess and administration of appropriate antibiotics. Fourteen patients (77.8%) were discharged on grade A of H.W. Mauser's grading system. Three mortalities were recorded only in patients who had grade 4 Bannister and Williams grading.

Discoloration of resin-based composites is a commonly encountered problem, and bleaching agents may be used for the therapy of the existing discoloration. The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro color recovery effect of different bleaching systems on the heavily discolored composite resin.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fifty disk-shaped dental composite specimens were prepared using A2 shade nanohybrid universal composite resin (3M ESPE Filtek Z550, St. Paul, MN, USA). Composite samples were immersed in coffee and turnip juice for 1 week in each. One laser activated bleaching (LB) (Biolase Laserwhite*20) and three conventional bleaching systems (Ultradent Opalescence Boost 40% (OB), Ultradent Opalescence PF 15% home bleaching (HB), Crest 3D White [Whitening Mouthwash]) were tested in this study. Distilled water was used as control group. The color of the samples were measured using a spectrophotometer (VITA Easy shade Compact, VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad SÃ¤ckingen, Germany). Color changes (Î”E00) were calculated using the CIEDE2000 formula. Statistical analyses were conducted using paired samples test, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey's multiple comparison tests (Î± = 0.05).


RESULTS
The staining beverages caused perceptible discoloration (Î”E00 > 2.25). The color recovery effect of all bleaching systems was statistically determined to be more effective than the control group (P < 0.05). Although OB group was found as the most effective bleaching system, there was no statistically significant difference among HB, OB, and LB groups (P > 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this study, 100 patients attending the outpatient department were enrolled. Cautery of perforation margin was carried out with 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After cautery, in small perforations less than 4 mm, a small piece of Gelfoam larger than the size of perforation was cut, impregnated with corticosteroid ointment, and carefully placed over the cauterized area under endoscopic visualization. In slightly larger perforations, that is, between 4 and 5 mm, after applying TCA to the margins of the perforation, a piece of Gelfoam larger than the size of perforation was soaked with corticosteroid ointment and placed in the middle ear cavity.


RESULTS
Patients had relief from various symptoms, such as tinnitus, heaviness, and so on. There was some amount of auditory improvement in almost all the cases. It ranged from 5 to 23 dB.

Mean administered tenoxicam dose was significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P < 0.0001). Further, ratio of patients treated with tenoxicam in Group 1 was significantly higher than that in Group 2 (Ï‡2 = 4.779, P = 0.029).


CONCLUSIONS
Preoperatively measured NLR may help to predict postoperative analgesic demand in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery, and thus sufficient postoperative pain control can be achieved with various preventive treatments taken at the perioperative period such as preemptive analgesia, local anesthetic administration at the end of surgery, or early administration of analgesics.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192626,2017,Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio predicts postoperative pain after orthognathic surgery.,n
230,"BACKGROUND
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is fast becoming a global epidemic, and its prevalence is increasing in children and young adults. The aim of the study was to identify young adults who had type 2 DM or impaired fasting glucose as well as those at risk of these conditions using anthropometric data and behavioral pattern.


METHODOLOGY
Two hundred and twenty newly admitted undergraduates who were randomly selected during the registration process were involved in the study. Anthropometric parameters were measured while information on demographic details, medical history, and family history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method.


RESULTS
Two hundred and seven (94%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4%) had serum glucose> 7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2%) had body mass index <25.0 while 6.8% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day.


CONCLUSION
Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192627,2017,Behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes mellitus among newly admitted undergraduates in a Nigerian University.,y

There is a paucity of information on the oral microbiome compositions of Nigerians, mostly due to lack of appropriate molecular techniques. In this pilot study, we sought to determine and characterize the oral bacterial compositions of ""healthy"" females.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oral samples were collected from three randomly selected females aged 56, 28, and 8 years. DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA V4 region was amplified using custom-barcoded primers before sequencing with Illumina MiSeq platform. Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology pipeline was used for 16S rRNA recognition. Distribution of taxonomic categories at different levels of resolution was done using the ribosomal RNA similarities to entries in the REFseq protein database. Diversity score was calculated based on the inverse Simpson's index.


RESULTS
The inverse Simpson's diversity index for the postmenopausal, premenopausal, and prepubertal was 7.74, 6.95, and 7.42 respectively. A total of 12 phyla, 70 genera, and 85 species were detected. Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria dominated the oral microbiome of the subjects. Streptococcus thermophilus (33.19%) was the most abundance species in subject 1, while subject 2 was highly predominated by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (80.65%), and subject 3 was predominated by Haemophilus influenzae (23.05%).


CONCLUSION
The study has revealed that bacteria with varying diversities colonized the subjects and it highlighted the importance of metagenomics in deciphering the oral bacterial compositions from females of different age groups. More studies are needed using metagenomics approach, to appreciate these bacterial organisms that are associated with health and disease in our environment.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192628,2017,"A comparative study of the oral microbiome compositions of healthy postmenopausal, premenopausal, and prepubertal Nigerian females, using 16s rrna metagenomics methods.",n
232,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of traumatic injuries of the permanent incisors in public primary schoolchildren from 8 to 12 years old in South-Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. Additionally, the relationship between traumatic dental injuries, parents' education level, family income, size of incisal overjet and the presence of anterior open bite were examined.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were collected through oral examinations and structured interviews, and included socio-economic indicators. A total of 2907 children of both genders (1498 boys, 1409 girls) were included in the study. The response rate was 97%.


RESULTS
The prevalence of dental injuries was 4.6% (n = 135). The highest frequency of trauma in permanent teeth was observed at the age of 12 (8%). Boys experienced more dental injuries than girls, 5.9% and 3.3% (p = 0.001), respectively. The most commonly reported cause of injuries to the permanent incisors was falls (71.8%), followed by collision with objects or people (17.8%). Maxillary central incisors were the most affected by dental injuries (154, 84.6%). The most common crown fracture was in enamel only (67.58%) followed by crown fracture of enamel and dentin (22.52%).


CONCLUSION
Socio-economic indicators and parents' level of education were not statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of traumatic dental injuries. Factors associated with increased risk of dental injuries in permanent teeth were age, gender, having an incisal overjet greater than 5mm and anterior open bite.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192629,2017,"Prevalence of traumatic dental injuries and associated factors among 8 to 12-years-old schoolchildren in Diyarbakir, Turkey.",n

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) have been extensively studied as biomarkers for the diagnosis of and prognostication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However there are only few reports on the clinical characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to the combination of the two tumor markers in hepatitis B virus-related HCC.


AIM
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of HBV-related HCC in relation to different sets of AFP and DCP values.


METHODS
Sixty-two patients with untreated HCC were studied. The positive value of AFP was set at 20 1U/L while DCP positive value was set at 150 mAU/ml. Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1(n=36) with AFP â‰¥ 20 IU/L and DCP â‰¥ 150 mAU/ml. Group 2(n=24) with AFP <20 1U/L and DCP â‰¥ 150 mAU/ml. Group 3 (n=2) with AFP < 20 1U/L and DCP < 150 mAU/ml. There were no patients in group 4 meant for those with AFP â‰¥ 20 1U/L and DCP < 150 mAU/ml. Clinical and laboratory variables were compared among the groups.


RESULTS
Clinical and laboratory variables were comparable among the groups with the exception of gender and values of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Males were significantly more than females among the groups (p<0.03). ALT values were significantly different among the groups (p<0.006). Paired comparisons between the groups showed the mean values of serum ALT were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1(p<0.003). The mean serum ALT values were also higher in group 2 than in group 3 (p <0.014). There was no significant difference between group 1 and group 3 (P = 0.124).


CONCLUSION
HCC patients who are sero-positive for DCP and sero-negative for AFP have significantly higher levels of serum ALT; serum ALT levels may be of diagnostic importance in AFP-negative, HBV-related HCC patients.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192630,2017,Diagnostic utility of alpha-fetoprotein and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin in nigerians with hepatocellular carcinoma.,n
234,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study is to highlight the clinical characteristics of patients with intermittent testicular torsion and draw attention to this underreported condition.


METHODS
Clinical and demographic data of all patients treated for intermittent testicular torsion from January 2007 to June 2015 were prospectively collected in a pro forma and analyzed. A diagnosis of intermittent torsion was made on the basis of recurrent scrotal pain, presence of abnormal testicular lie in otherwise normal testes, absence of urinary symptoms, and negative urine cultures. This diagnosis was confirmed by resolution of symptoms following bilateral orchidopexy. All patients had bilateral orchidopexy at the next operative day and were followed up for 12 months.


RESULTS
Forty-five patients with a mean age of 20.9 years (Â±4.02) were seen within the study period. The left testis was more often involved than the right: 53.3% versus 37.8%. The condition was bilateral in 4 patients (8.9%). A total of 84 testes were evaluated. Horizontal lie was the most common anomaly causing intermittent testicular torsion 49%, followed by the clapper-bell deformity 27.5%. Patients experienced a mean of 2.8 (Â±1.74) acute pain episodes before testicular fixation. Bilateral orchidopexy resulted in resolution of symptoms and preservation of testicular volume.


CONCLUSION
Horizontal lie of the testis is the most common cause of intermittent testicular torsion. The condition is more common on the left than the right testis and is predominantly unilateral. Intermittent testicular pain in the presence of abnormal testicular lie should warrant a diagnosis of intermittent testicular torsion. Early bilateral orchidopexy is efficacious.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192631,2017,Intermittent testicular torsion.,n

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength (SBS) of resin composites to dentin using total etch dentin bonding adhesives.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixty extracted human molars were flattened to obtain dentin surfaces. The samples were divided into three groups (n = 20): Group I: 37% phosphoric acid + optibond FL + resin composite; Group II: Erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser (medium short pulse [MSP] mode, 120 mJ/10 Hz) + optibond FL + resin composite; Group III: Er:YAG laser (quantum square pulse [QSP] mode, 120 mJ/10 Hz) + optibond FL + resin composite. After the specimens were prepared, the SBS test was performed at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The fractured specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope to evaluate the fracture pattern. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's honestly significant difference tests. One sample of treated dentin surface from each group was sputter-coated with gold, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were captured.


RESULTS
Acid etching showed significantly higher SBS than the other groups (P < 0.05). However, the difference between Er:YAG MSP and QSP mode groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). SEM images of the acid-etched dentin surface showed opened dentinal tubule with a regular surface, but Er:YAG MSP mode treated surface was irregular. The surface treated with Er:YAG QSP mode represented wide dentinal tubules with a clean and flat surface.


CONCLUSION
Using different modes (MSP and QSP) of Er:YAG laser for dentin surface treatment before application of total etch adhesives is still not an sufficient alternative compared to acid etching.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192632,2017,Effect of different modes of erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser on shear bond strength to dentin.,n

Several publications have presented pattern of maxillofacial surgical conditions based on data from hospital-based studies. The objective of this study is to present the spectrum of maxillofacial surgical conditions from the perspective of a community study.


METHODS
This is a prospective study of all patients seen and treated from 2011 to 2016. The information obtained included the biodata, clinical history of the disease conditions, radiological result, histopathologic result, diagnosis, and treatment records. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20.0.


RESULTS
There was a total of 863 patients, male 464 (53.8%) and female 399 (46.2%). The male to female sex ratio was 1.16:1. The age range was 3 days to 76 years with a mean age (SD) 16.8 Â± 15.8 years. The spectrum of surgical conditions: facial clefts 492(57.0%); tumor and tumor-like lesions 126(15.2%), trauma 6(0.7%), and others 48(5.5 %). The size of tumors ranged from 5 to 50.4 cm2 with a mean (SD) 21.6 Â± 11.9 cm2 and the duration of lesion ranged from 1 to 20 years with mean (SD) 8.7 Â± 6.0 years. A total of 622(77.4) cases were operated within the study period with immediate jaw reconstruction in 5(0.8%) patients. Minor complications were recorded but there was no mortality.


CONCLUSION
The spectrum of maxillofacial surgery from community-based data was associated with higher percentage of facial cleft as compared to hospital-based study that is associated with higher traumatic injury cases.

Seizures are common reasons for neurologic consultations and investigations. In the absence of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scanning of the brain is a reliable and cheaper alternative. Little is known about the pattern of brain lesions in patients with recurrent seizures in Nigeria.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the pattern of significant intracerebral lesions in patients presenting with recurrent seizures in a tertiary hospital in Enugu.


METHODS
All the medical and computer tomography records of patients with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent seizures were reviewed. The study duration was 11 years (January 2003 to December 2013). Relevant data were obtained and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 and GraphPad Prism 6.


RESULTS
The diagnostic yield of CT was 55.1%. Twenty (9.3%) individuals had two lesions each. The significant findings were tumors (20.4%), encephalomalacia (18.9%) and strokes (7.7% (ischemic stroke, 4.1%, intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.1%, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.5%). Hydrocephalus (HCP) was found in 18 (9.2%) cases, and 30% of them occurred together with other lesions. The diagnostic yield increased with age reaching 84.4% from the age of 60 years. Only patients with encephalomalacia were statistically older than those with normal imaging.


CONCLUSION

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease can result in mortality varying from 3.0% to 50.0%. In this study, we wished to discuss computed tomography (CT) findings together with clinical and laboratory findings in patients who had disease-related neurological signs.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study included patients who were diagnosed with CCHF. Seventeen patients that had neurological signs were enrolled as the patient group. As a control group, 40 patients diagnosed with CCHF and did not have neurological signs were enrolled. Patients who had neurological signs were examined with brain CT. Radiological and clinical findings of both groups were compared.


RESULTS
There were pathological findings in three patients while brain CT's of 14 patients were evaluated as normal. Blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, neutrophil, activated partial thromboplastin time, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in the group with neurological signs whereas platelet count and calcium levels were significantly lower in this group. Six of 57 patients died during the follow-up period. Six patients who died were in the group, in which central nervous system (CNS) imaging study was performed.

Vitamin D status and risk factors of Vitamin D deficiency in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in China have been seldom reported before. In this study, we aim to investigate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status and find the predictors of Vitamin D deficiency in predialysis patients with Stage 3-5 CKDs in Southern China.


METHODS
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, hospitalized predialysis patients who were diagnosed of Stage 3-5 CKD and had taken measurement of serum 25(OH)D in a single center from January 2014 to June 2015 were included. Patients were divided into Vitamin D deficiency group and nondeficiency group depending on the cutoff serum 25(OH)D value of 37 nmol/L. Clinical and biochemical parameters were collected and evaluated for predictors of Vitamin D deficiency by logistic regression.


RESULTS
One hundred and fifty-two patients were included in this study, of which 87 (57.2%) were in Vitamin D insufficiency state while 60 (39.5%) were in Vitamin D deficiency state. Serum 25(OH)D levels of patients in Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD were lower than that of patients in Stage 3 CKD (P = 0.002). It was discovered that female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.674; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.607-8.396; P = 0.002), serum albumin level <30.0 g/L (OR = 6.816; 95% CI, 2.634-17.633; P < 0.001), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (OR = 4.761; 95% CI, 1.353-16.754; P = 0.015) were independent predictors of Vitamin D deficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are common in predialysis patients with Stage 3-5 CKD in Southern China.

Femoral shaft fractures are common injuries in adults. Closed locked intramedullary nailing is the recommended treatment for femoral shaft fractures due to its high union rate.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to determine the outcome of management of closed femoral shaft fractures in adult patients, using open locked intramedullary nailing.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This is a prospective study which was carried out on all adult patients aged 16 years and above who presented within 2 weeks of sustaining closed femoral shaft fractures to the accident and emergency unit of a University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria from January 2013 to December 2013. Pathological fractures were excluded from the study. The procedure was carried out using standard techniques, and each patient was followed up for a minimum of 1 year.


RESULTS
Forty-three patients were recruited into the study. They had a mean age of 36.9 Â± 11.7 years, with a male to female ratio of 2.9:1. The most common cause of closed femoral shaft fractures was road traffic crashes (95.3%), with motorcycle-related injuries found to be the highest type (56.1%). The rate of union in the study was 95.3%. The average time to radiological union was 14.0 Â± 1.2 weeks while the mean time to painless full weight bearing was 14.2 Â± 1.2 weeks. Among the complications encountered were broken nails (4.7%), infection, loosening of the distal screw, and limb length discrepancy (2.3% each).

Associations between axial length (AL) to corneal radius of curvature (CR) ratio and refractive status in a healthy Nigerian adult population were studied.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Healthy students and members of staff of Obafemi Awolowo Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, South West Nigeria, free of obvious ocular diseases except possible refractive errors were recruited. Consecutive consenting volunteers were recruited by simple random sampling and a proportionate sample of each population based on its representative fraction in the hospital community was recruited. The study was conducted between June and August 2011. Noncycloplegic objective refraction was done and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of the right eyes was used for calculation. The AL, CR, and keratometric readings were measured with the IOL Master. The AL/CR ratio was calculated. The data were analyzed with statistical software package STATA 13.


RESULTS
Three hundred and fifty volunteers aged 18-60 years were studied. The mean Â± standard deviation of AL/CR and SER were 3.04 Â± 0.10 and -0.38 Â± 1.42D, respectively. AL in myopia was significantly higher than in emmetropia and hypermetropia. There were no significant differences between CR in the refraction groups. Myopes had significantly higher AL/CR than nonmyopes. On controlling for age and gender, 1 mm increase in AL increased SER by -0.77D (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.91--0.64D) while a unit increase in AL/CR increased SER by -8.89D (95% CI -10.00--7.78D). Whereas AL accounts for 39% of variability in SER (P < 0.001), AL/CR accounts for 51% of the variability observed in SER (P < 0.001).


CONCLUSION

To determine an exploratory estimation of the strength of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension diagnoses as risk indicators for missing teeth in a sample of Mexican adults.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A comparative cross-sectional study of sixty adult patients in a health center in Mexico included as dependent variable, the number of missing teeth (and having a functional dentition) and as independent variables, diagnoses for diabetes or hypertension, age, sex, maximum level of schooling, and tobacco use. Of the 60 participants, 20 were diagnosed with T2DM, 13 with hypertension, and 27 were otherwise diagnosed as healthy in their most recent medical checkup. A negative binomial regression (NBR) model was generated.


RESULTS
Mean age was 50.7 Â± 16.2 and 50.0% were women. Mean number of missing teeth was 4.98 Â± 4.17. In the multivariate NBR model, we observed that individuals with T2DM had higher risk of more missing teeth (incidence rate ratios [IRRs] = 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.09-4.69), followed by those with hypertension (IRRs = 2.63; 95% CI = 1.77-3.90). In addition, participants with current tobacco use were significantly more likely to have suffered tooth loss (P < 0.05) than those who were never smokers or former smokers, just like older participants (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
T2DM and hypertension are independently associated with higher experience of missing teeth in an open adult population in Mexico.

In the present study, we demonstrated that lncRNA-H19 act as an endogenous 'sponge', which binds directly to miR-130b-3p and therefore inhibits its activity on Dsg1. MiR-130b-3p was illustrated to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation by targeting Dsg1. H19 regulates Dsg1 expression and the consequent keratinocyte differentiation through miR-130b-3p. Our study casts light on a novel regulatory model of keratinocyte differentiation, which may provide new therapeutic targets of skin diseases.",England,Cell death & disease,29192645,2017,H19 lncRNA regulates keratinocyte differentiation by targeting miR-130b-3p.,n
249,"The histopathologic diagnosis of hepatic graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow and stem cell transplantation can be challenging, but timely and unambiguous diagnosis is essential for appropriate patient management. To address this diagnostic dilemma, we identified histologic features specific for hepatic graft-versus-host disease and developed a diagnostic algorithm. Two hepatopathologists blindly evaluated 40 liver biopsies from patients with clinically and biologically confirmed graft-versus-host disease, as well as 44 controls, for percent bile duct loss, bile duct damage, intraepithelial lymphocytes, ductular reaction, acidophilic bodies/10 high power fields (HPF), cholestasis, portal and lobular inflammation, and endotheliitis. Compared with controls, graft-versus-host disease cases had significantly more bile duct loss (P<0.0001), bile duct damage (P=0.0002), cholestasis (P<0.0001), and acidophilic bodies/10 HPF (P=0.0006), as well as significantly less ductular reaction (P<0.0001). Significance was maintained with a drug-induced liver injury-only control group. No histologic differences were noted in acute versus chronic graft-versus-host disease, nor cholestatic versus hepatitic types. An algorithm to predict likelihood of graft-versus-host disease was developed, with a three-tiered scoring system: 1-2 not, 3-4 probable, and 5-8 unequivocal graft-versus-host disease. This algorithm had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 93%, and accuracy of 92%. We identified histologic features with specificity for hepatic graft-versus-host disease and developed a simple algorithm for pathologists to predict its likelihood, distinguishing this critical diagnosis promptly from mimickers having vastly different treatments and prognoses.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.151.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192646,2017,Development of a novel histologic diagnostic algorithm for hepatic graft-versus-host disease.,n
250,"Characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment enables the identification of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers, the development of novel therapeutic targets and strategies, and the possibility to guide first-line treatment algorithms. Although the driving elements within the tumor microenvironment of individual primary organ sites differ, many of the salient features remain the same. The presence of a robust antitumor milieu characterized by an abundance of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, Th1 helper cells, and associated cytokines often indicates a degree of tumor containment by the immune system and can even lead to tumor elimination. Some of these features have been combined into an 'Immunoscore', which has been shown to complement the prognostic ability of the current TNM staging for early stage colorectal carcinomas. Features of the immune microenvironment are also potential therapeutic targets, and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are especially promising. FDA-approved indications for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 are rapidly expanding across numerous tumor types and, in certain cases, are accompanied by companion or complimentary PD-L1 immunohistochemical diagnostics. Pathologists have direct visual access to tumor tissue and in-depth knowledge of the histological variations between and within tumor types and thus are poised to drive forward our understanding of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the key components of the tumor microenvironment, presents an overview of and the challenges with PD-L1 antibodies and assays, and addresses newer candidate biomarkers, such as CD8+ cell density and mutational load. Characteristics of the local immune contexture and current pathology-related practices for specific tumor types are also addressed. In the future, characterization of the host antitumor immune response using multiplexed and multimodality biomarkers may help predict which patients will respond to immune-based therapies.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.156.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192647,2017,Implications of the tumor immune microenvironment for staging and therapeutics.,n
251,"Several lines of evidence indicate that cytomegalovirus infection can be substantially associated with onset of inflammatory bowel disease, especially in patients refractory to immunosuppressive treatment. As cytomegalovirus is widely spread in the population, here we present a quantitative detection system suitable to differentiate clinically relevant cytomegalovirus infection from common latent cytomegalovirus. Using a quantitative real-time PCR approach, cytomegalovirus viral load was evaluated in 917 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded colon biopsy samples of 136 patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. Besides initial cytomegalovirus testing, the PCR system was also used to monitor therapy response after antiviral treatment. Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in 37 patients (27%) with varying viral loads ranging from 5 to 8.7 Ã— 105 copies/105 cells. Thereof, 13 patients (35%) received an antiviral treatment with 12 of them going into remission (92%). Later, five patients displayed a relapse and three patients who agreed to restart antiviral treatment again showed positive therapy response. A retrospective comparison of viral loads with antiviral therapy response revealed a threshold of 600 cytomegalovirus copies/105 cells as indicative for clinically relevant infection. Of note, sensitivity of cytomegalovirus detection by immunohistochemistry was found to be insufficient to reliably identify antiviral therapy responders. In conclusion, quantitative real-time PCR using formalin-fixed biopsy samples is suitable for detection of cytomegalovirus infection in tissue samples of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, it allows the definition of a viral load threshold, predictive for clinical relevance concerning antiviral therapy response.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.149.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192648,2017,Identification of clinically relevant cytomegalovirus infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,n
252,"Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis histologically characterized by multi-systemic proliferation of mature histiocytes in a background of inflammatory stroma. The disease can involve virtually any organ system; most commonly the bones, skin, retroperitoneum, heart, orbit, lung, and brain are affected. Although a histiocytic proliferation is the histological hallmark of the disease, a wide range of morphological appearances have been described as part of case studies or small series. A comprehensive review of histopathological features in clinically and molecularly defined Erdheim-Chester disease has yet to be characterized. To address this issue and help guide clinical practice, we comprehensively analyzed the pathological spectrum of Erdheim-Chester disease in a clinically and molecularly defined cohort. We reviewed 73 biopsies from 42 patients showing involvement by histiocytosis from a variety of organ systems, including bone (16), retroperitoneum (11), skin (19), orbit (6), brain (5), lung (6), cardiac structures (2), epidural soft tissue (3), oral cavity (2), subcutaneous soft tissue (2), and testis (2). In eight patients, one or more bone marrow biopsies were performed due to clinical indication and an accompanying myeloid neoplasm was detected in six of them. Thirty-eight cases were investigated for genetic abnormalities. Somatic mutations involving BRAF (25/38), MAP2K1 (6/38), ARAF (2/38), MAP2K2 (1/38), KRAS (1/38), and NRAS (1/38) genes were detected. One of the cases with a MAP2K1 mutation also harbored a PIK3CA mutation. We have observed marked heterogeneity in histology and immunophenotype, identified site-specific features, overlap with other histiocytic and myeloid disorders and potential diagnostic pitfalls. We hope that broadening the spectrum of recognized pathologic manifestations of Erdheim-Chester disease will help practicing clinicians and pathologists to diagnose Erdheim-Chester disease early in the disease course and manage these patients effectively.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.160.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192649,2017,The histopathology of Erdheim-Chester disease: a comprehensive review of a molecularly characterized cohort.,n
253,"Intramucosal lipomas are rare and easily overlooked by pathologists, despite their diagnostic significance for Cowden syndrome (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome), an inherited multiorgan cancer syndrome. Only 25-35% of patients harbor identifiable PTEN mutations, thus clinical features, like intramucosal lipomas, remain the mainstay of diagnosis. The significance and diagnostic approach to intramucosal lipomas have not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. Intramucosal lipomas are mimicked by pseudolipomatosis coli, an artifactual mucosal gas infiltration from endoscopic insufflation. This differential was investigated by morphology and S-100 immunohistochemistry. Twenty-five colonic intramucosal lipomas were identified from 176 archival gastrointestinal lipomas from 1998 to 2017. Controls included 40 submucosal lipomas and 30 pseudolipomatoses. S-100 immunohistochemistry on all 95 lesions confirmed delicate fat vacuole membranous and nuclear S-100 staining in lipomas absent from pseudolipomatoses. Differentiating morphology between intramucosal lipoma and pseudolipomatosis, respectively, included consistently large, regular fat vacuoles (92% vs 7%), associated spindle cells (80% vs 0%), and mucosal lymphoid aggregate involvement (12% vs 80%). Of the 25 intramucosal lipomas, five patients (20%) had confirmed Cowden syndrome (four with PTEN mutations). In four of these Cowden patients, the intramucosal lipoma was the index diagnostic lesion. Three (12%) intramucosal lipoma patients had additional clinical features associated with Cowden syndrome, but did not meet the diagnostic criteria. Sporadic-type intramucosal lipomas were identified in 17 patients (68%) without evidence of Cowden syndrome, including three with normal PTEN genetic testing. No distinguishing endoscopic or pathologic polyp features were identified between sporadic and syndromic intramucosal lipomas. These data provide evidence that intramucosal lipomas are important harbingers of Cowden syndrome, making up approximately one-third of this series, the largest in the literature. We also show for the first time that two-thirds of intramucosal lipomas are sporadic. Gastrointestinal pathologists, gastroenterologists, and geneticists should increase their awareness of this subtle but diagnosable lesion strongly associated with Cowden syndrome.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.161.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192650,2017,Intramucosal lipomas of the colon implicate Cowden syndrome.,n
254,"Monocytosis can develop during disease course in primary myelofibrosis simulating that seen in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and should not lead to disease reclassification. In contrast, at presentation, rare cases have clinical, morphologic, and molecular genetic features truly intermediate between primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The taxonomy and natural history of these diseases are unclear. We identified cases which either: (1) fulfilled the 2008 World Health Organization criteria for primary myelofibrosis but had absolute monocytosis and, when available, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-related mutations (ASXL1, SRSF2, TET2) or (2) fulfilled criteria of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia but had megakaryocytic proliferation and atypia, marrow fibrosis, and myeloproliferative-type driver mutations (JAK2, MPL, CALR). Patients with established primary myelofibrosis who developed monocytosis and those with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with marrow fibrosis were excluded. By combining the pathology databases of two large institutions, six eligible cases were identified. Patients were predominantly male and elderly with monocytosis at diagnosis (average 17.5%/2.3 Ã— 103/Î¼l), organomegaly, primary myelofibrosis-like atypical megakaryocytes admixed with a variable number of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like hypolobated forms, variable myelodysplasia, marrow fibrosis and osteosclerosis. All had a normal karyotype and no myelodysplasia-associated cytogenetic abnormalities. Five of the patients in whom a more extensive molecular characterization was performed showed co-mutations involving JAK2 or MPL and ASXL1, SRSF2, TET2, NRAS, and/or KRAS. Disease progression has occurred in all and two have died. Rare patients present with features that overlap between primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are thus difficult to classify based on current World Health Organization criteria. Biologically, these cases likely represent primary myelofibrosis with monocytosis, dysplasia, and secondary (non-driver) mutations at presentation. Alternatively, they may represent a true gray zone of neoplasms. Their clinical behavior appears aggressive and innovative therapeutic approaches may be beneficial in this particular subset.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.148.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192651,2017,Myeloid neoplasms with features intermediate between primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,n
255,"High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma likely encompasses underrecognized tumors harboring genetic abnormalities besides YWHAE-NUTM2 fusion. Triggered by three initial endometrial stromal sarcomas with ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion characterized by high-grade morphology and aggressive clinical behavior, we herein investigate the clinicopathologic features of this genetic subset by expanding the analysis to 17 such tumors. All of them occurred in adult women with a median age of 54 (range, 28-71) years. They were predominantly based in the endomyometrium and demonstrated tongue-like and/or pushing myometrial invasion. Most were uniformly cellular and displayed haphazard fascicles of spindle cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia. Myxoid matrix was seen in 14 of 17 (82%) tumors, and collagen plaques were seen in 8 (47%). The mitotic index was â‰¥10 mitotic figures/10 high-power fields (HPFs) in 14 of 17 (82%) tumors with a median of 14.5 mitotic figures/10 HPFs. No foci of conventional or variant low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma were seen. All tumors expressed CD10 with only limited or absent desmin, SMA and/or h-caldesmon staining. ER and PR expression in >5% of cells was seen in 4 of 12 (33%) tumors. Diffuse cyclin D1 and BCOR immunoreactivity was present in 7 of 8 (88%) and 7 of 14 (50%) tumors, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization or targeted RNA sequencing confirmed ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion in all tumors, including four and two previously diagnosed as myxoid leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, respectively. Limited clinical data suggest that patients present at higher stage and have worse prognosis compared with published outcomes in low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Tumors with ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion constitute a distinct group of endometrial stromal sarcomas with high-grade morphology that should be distinguished from other uterine mesenchymal neoplasms that may demonstrate myxoid morphology.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2017.162.",United States,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",29192652,2017,ZC3H7B-BCOR high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas: a report of 17 cases of a newly defined entity.,n

277,"Short-chain fatty acids and their corresponding acyl-CoAs sit at the crossroads of metabolic pathways and play important roles in diverse cellular processes. They are also precursors for protein post-translational lysine acylation modifications. A noteworthy example is the newly identified lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib) that is derived from 2-hydroxyisobutyrate and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. Histone Khib has been shown to be associated with active gene expression in spermatogenic cells. However, the key elements that regulate this post-translational lysine acylation pathway remain unknown. This has hindered characterization of the mechanisms by which this modification exerts its biological functions. Here we show that Esa1p in budding yeast and its homologue Tip60 in human could add Khib to substrate proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have identified HDAC2 and HDAC3 as the major enzymes to remove Khib. Moreover, we report the first global profiling of Khib proteome in mammalian cells, identifying 6 548 Khib sites on 1 725 substrate proteins. Our study has thus discovered both the ""writers"" and ""erasers"" for histone Khib marks, and major Khib protein substrates. These results not only illustrate the landscape of this new lysine acylation pathway, but also open new avenues for studying diverse functions of cellular metabolites associated with this pathway.Cell Research advance online publication 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cr.2017.149.",England,Cell research,29192674,2017,Landscape of the regulatory elements for lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation pathway.,n

It is our intention to demonstrate that the pre-operative genetic screening for TGFBI mutations should be mandatory for refractive surgery candidates.Patients and MethodsIn this study, we reviewed the proband's post-LASIK slit-lamp and in vivo confocal microscopy images and genetic testing results, and performed genetic testing on eleven additional members of the family to investigate the penetrance of corneal dystrophy in asymptomatic members who carry the mutation.ResultsThe proband demonstrated a post-LASIK exacerbation of Granular Corneal Dystrophy type 2 (GCD2), identified as a TGFBI R124H mutation. Three of the 11 family members tested positive for the same R124H mutation as the proband.ConclusionThe lesson learned from this case is that the genetic screening of TGFBI mutations must be incorporated into the pre-operative screening procedures to prevent exacerbation and recurrence, which eventually could lead to the need for a corneal transplant.Eye advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/eye.2017.265.",England,"Eye (London, England)",29192679,2017,Post-LASIK exacerbation of granular corneal dystrophy type 2 in members of a chinese family.,n

Most cases of band keratopathy were idiopathic (36%). The most commonly identified underlying diagnosis was long-term topical glaucoma therapy (27%). Median presenting visual acuity was 6/18 (range 6/6-NPL) with the visual axis affected in 97.8% of cases. Treatment involved corneal epithelium removal, recurrent application of topical EDTA, and subsequent debridement. The mean duration of the operation was 20â€‰min (range 10-45). Mean initial follow-up time was 40 days, and the visual axis was clear in 97.8%. Visual acuity was maintained or improved in 79.8%, with 13.5% improving by two lines or more. The mean length of follow-up was 581 days (median 374, maximum 2438). Twenty-five eyes (28.1%) showed localised recurrence of calcium with a mean time of 546 days (median 374), but only four cases required repeat EDTA chelation. The median time between operations was 430 days. Thirty-two per cent of the recurrence cases were associated with hypotony or chronic presence of silicone oil.ConclusionsChelation of calcium with topical EDTA is a safe and effective treatment for band keratopathy.

This review aimed to explore the most contemporary evidence on whether poor oral health and dementia occurs in the same individuals or populations, to outline the nature of the relationship between these two health outcomes and to discuss the implication of any findings for health services and future research. The review was undertaken by a working group comprising consultant clinicians from medicine and dentistry, trainees, public health and academic staff. Whilst other rapid reviews in the current series limited their search to systematic reviews, this review focused on primary research involving cohort and case-control studies because of the lack of high level evidence in this new and important field. The results suggest that poor oral hygiene is associated with dementia, and more so amongst people in advanced stages of the disease.

294,"Introduction Communication within the doctor-patient relationship is complex due to a variety of reasons; a patient's understanding may not correspond with the clinician's vocabulary, resulting in misunderstanding, anxiety and ill-informed decision making. We investigated the understanding of terminology commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine clinics.Methods We investigated patients' understanding using a questionnaire-based study in the out-patient setting. Age, gender, first language and highest educational level were recorded. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions regarding patients' understanding of words as well as asking patients to define certain terms. Vocabulary included 'ulcer', 'blister', 'cancer', 'malignant' and 'benign'.Results and conclusions Many patients have difficulty in understanding and explaining commonly used terminology. 'Blister' was the most commonly understood term, while 'benign' and 'lesion' were the least well understood.

295,"Introduction Oral bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed anti-resorptive drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis, but osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious complication. The early diagnosis of this destructive side effect is crucial in preventing excessive bone loss, pain and infection.Objective To aid dental practitioners in the early identification of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.Method A scoping review was carried out.Data sources We searched MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source (DOSS), Proquest Dissertation and Theses Search, to identify references that described clinical and radiological findings in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).Data selection Nineteen references mentioned the earliest radiological changes in MRONJ with a description of the observations and were included in the analysis.Data synthesis The radiographic signs included osteosclerosis/lysis, widening of the periodontal ligament and thickening of the lamina dura and cortex. To assess the quality of original data on which recommendations had been made, these 19 studies were subjected to a quality appraisal.Conclusion Using bone exposure as a criterion for diagnosis of MRONJ, leads to delayed diagnosis and a poor response to treatment. In those patients at risk of bone exposure with MRONJ, insufficient information is present in the literature to allow the general dental practitioner to reliably identify the radiographic features indicating imminent bone exposure. A well-designed prospective study is needed.",England,British dental journal,29192692,2017,Detecting the earliest radiological signs of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis.,n
296,"OBJECTIVE
Perinatal loss (stillbirth or early infant death) is often a sudden, unexpected event for families. We evaluated who communicates the loss to the parents and who is there for support at the delivery or death.


STUDY DESIGN
We conducted a mail survey of 900 bereaved and 500 live-birth mothers to assess emotional, physical and reproductive health outcomes.


RESULTS
We had a 44% response rate at 9 months after birth or loss from 377 bereaved mothers and 232 with surviving infants. Bereaved women were less likely to have hospital staff or family members present at delivery. African-American (versus Caucasian) mothers were half as likely to have first heard about their stillbirth from a physician or midwife.

We constructed a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) nomogram to represent major sectors of the Israeli population. We studied the risk of hyperbilirubinemia, defined as meeting the requirements for phototherapy, per percentile risk category.


STUDY DESIGN
Newborns â©¾36 weeks gestation were tested daily for TcB, using Drager JM-103 devices, during birth hospitalization. A nomogram was constructed and divided into four risk groups and validated by calculating the need for phototherapy for each group.


RESULTS
A total of 3303 measurements were performed on 1059 consecutive newborns including Ashkenazi, Sephardic and mixed Ashkenazi/Sephardic Jews, Arab and Ethiopian Jewish. Phototherapy risk increased progressively and more than 100-fold, from 0/225 in the <40th percentile group through 27/120 (22.5%) for those >95th percentile (relative risk (95% confidence interval) 102 (6 to 1669) for those >95th percentile compared with those <40th percentile). The optimal risk for discriminating the need for phototherapy was >75th percentile (sensitivity 93.33, specificity 59.47).

300,"There has been tremendous interest in piezoelectricity at the nanoscale, for example in nanowires and nanofibers where piezoelectric properties may be enhanced or controllably tuned, thus necessitating robust characterization techniques of piezoelectric response in nanomaterials. Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) is a well-established scanning probe technique routinely used to image piezoelectric/ferroelectric domains in thin films, however, its applicability to nanoscale objects is limited due to the requirement for physical contact with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip that may cause dislocation or damage, particularly to soft materials, during scanning. Here we report a non-destructive PFM (ND-PFM) technique wherein the tip is oscillated into ""discontinuous"" contact during scanning, while applying an AC bias between tip and sample and extracting the piezoelectric response for each contact point by monitoring the resulting localized deformation at the AC frequency. ND-PFM is successfully applied to soft polymeric (poly-l-lactic acid) nanowires, as well as hard ceramic (barium zirconate titanate-barium calcium titanate) nanowires, both previously inaccessible by conventional PFM.

By performing systematic density functional theory calculations, here we show that MXenes can serve as excellent terahertz detecting materials. Giant optical absorption and extinction coefficients are observed in the terahertz range in the most popular MXene, namely, Ti3C2, which is regardless of the stacking degree. Various other optical properties have been investigated as well in the terahertz range for in-depth understanding of its optical response. We find that the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of stacked Ti3C2 flakes is comparable to that of carbon nanotube films. Based on excellent terahertz absorption and decent thermoelectric efficiency in MXenes, we finally suggest the promise of MXenes in terahertz detection applications, which includes terahertz bolometers and photothermoelectric detectors.

306,"The substrate-controlled asymmetric total synthesis and absolute configurational assignment of biologically active 3Î±,4Î±-epoxy-5Î²-pipermethystine, a minor component in the aerial parts of kava, has been achieved by featuring, as a key step, the environmentally friendly and direct synthesis of 2,3-epoxyamides from allyl amines. By using the chiron approach, first a carbohydrate-derived dehydropiperidine was prepared and subjected to a stereoselective tandem C-H/C[double bond, length as m-dash]C oxidation reaction. In this attempt, the required Î±,Î±-trans-epoxy-2-piperidone skeleton of the kava metabolite precursor was not achieved, although the tandem oxidation was highly stereoselective. However, starting from non-carbohydrate 3-hydroxy-4,5-dehydropiperidine, and using the same tandem oxidation, the target intermediate was obtained in high yield and complete unprecedented anti-stereoselectivity. Since the proposed mechanistic course of this tandem oxidation implies the transient formation of an Î±,Î²-unsaturated amide followed by the subsequent epoxidation reaction, this second approach supports the previously established biotransformation proposal of (-)-pipermethystine to (-)-3Î±,4Î±-epoxy-5Î²-pipermethystine.",England,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,29192703,2017,"The direct and highly diastereoselective synthesis of 3,4-epoxy-2-piperidones.

307,"Microbial biomass and acclimation can affect the removal of organic chemicals in natural surface waters. In order to account for these effects and develop more robust models for biodegradation, we have compiled and curated removal data for un-acclimated (pristine) surface waters on which we developed quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). Global analysis of the very heterogeneous dataset including neutral, anionic, cationic and zwitterionic chemicals (N = 233) using a random forest algorithm showed that useful predictions were possible (Qext2 = 0.4-0.5) though relatively large standard errors were associated (SDEP âˆ¼0.7). Classification of the chemicals based on speciation state and metabolic pathway showed that biodegradation is influenced by the two, and that the dependence of biodegradation on chemical characteristics is non-linear. Class-specific QSAR analysis indicated that shape and charge distribution determine the biodegradation of neutral chemicals (R2 âˆ¼ 0.6), e.g. through membrane permeation or binding to P450 enzymes, whereas the average biodegradation of charged chemicals is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower, for which degradation depends more directly on cellular uptake (R2 âˆ¼ 0.6). Further analysis showed that specific chemical classes such as peptides and organic halogens are relatively less biodegradable in pristine surface waters, resulting in the need for the microbial consortia to acclimate. Additional literature data was used to verify an acclimation model (based on Monod-type kinetics) capable of extrapolating QSAR predictions to acclimating conditions such as in water treatment, downstream lakes and large rivers under Î¼g L-1 to mg L-1 concentrations. The framework developed, despite being based on multiple assumptions, is promising and needs further validation using experimentation with more standardised and homogenised conditions as well as adequate characterization of the inoculum used.",England,Environmental science.

309,"Superoxide species are key intermediates in the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) that occur at the cathodes of aprotic metal-air batteries. Herein we report a DFT study of the effects of an externally applied electric field (Îµ) on the stability of various molecular superoxide species, including MO2 (M = Li, Na, K) and O2-, on gold surfaces, which shows that the stability of such species on Au electrodes can be materially affected by the presence of an electric field and solvent molecules, suggesting that such effects should be included in the first-principles modeling of cathode reactions in metal-O2 cells. In the Îµ range of Â±0.4 V Ã…-1, the stability of MO2 species is found to vary by up to |0.4| eV on Au(111) and |0.2| eV on Au(211) in vacuo, which is larger than the field effects on the stability of O and OH, key intermediates in the ORR by hydrogen. An aprotic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), considered here via the inclusion of explicit DMSO molecules above the Au surfaces, stabilizes all three MO2 species at zero fields and amplifies the field effects on the stability of MO2, on both Au surfaces. The variations in the stability of the molecular MO2 species with Îµ, which have small polarizabilities, are closely approximated by the first-order Stark effect (Î¼0Â·Îµ, where Î¼0 is the static surface dipole moment induced by adsorption at Îµ = 0 V Ã…-1). The superoxide anion (O2-) that has been identified on an under-coordinated Au site has a larger polarizability than the MOx species and a Î¼0 that is opposite in sign to those of the metal MO2 species, which results in larger errors by the first-order approximation, although its stability varies only moderately under positive electric fields of up to 0.4 V Ã…-1.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192706,2017,Estimation of electric field effects on the adsorption of molecular superoxide species on Au based on density functional theory.,n
310,"Healthy foods like polyphenol-rich berries and high quality edible proteins are in demand in today's functional food marketplace, but it can be difficult to formulate convenient food products with physiologically-relevant amounts of these ingredients and still maintain product quality. In part, this is because proteins can interact with other food ingredients and precipitate destabilizing events, which can disrupt food structure and diminish shelf life. Proteins in foods can also interact with human receptors to provoke adverse consequences such as allergies. When proteins and polyphenols were pre-aggregated into stable colloidal particles prior to use as ingredients, highly palatable food formulations (with reduced astringency of polyphenols) could be prepared, and the overall structural properties of food formulations were significantly improved. All of the nutritive and phytoactive benefits of the proteins and concentrated polyphenols remained highly bioavailable, but the protein molecules in the particle matrix did not self-aggregate into networks or react with other food ingredients. Both the drainage half-life (a marker of structural stability) and the yield stress (resistance to flow) of model foams made with the protein-polyphenol particles were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Of high significance in this complexation process, the reactive allergenic epitopes of certain proteins were effectively blunted by binding with polyphenols, attenuating the allergenicity of the food proteins. Porcine macrophages produced TNF-Î± proinflammatory cytokine when provoked with whey protein, but, this response was blocked completely when the cells were stimulated with particles that complexed whey protein with cinnamon-derived polyphenols. Cytokine and chemokine production characteristic of allergic reactions were blocked by the polyphenols, allowing for the potential creation of hypoallergenic protein-berry polyphenol enriched foods.",England,Food & function,29192707,2017,Polyphenol-enriched berry extracts naturally modulate reactive proteins in model foods.,n
311,"Metal hydrides are regarded as a series of promising hydrogen-supplying fuel for solid rocket propellants. Their effects on the energetic and combustion performances of propellants are closely related to their reaction mechanisms. Here we report a first attempt to determine the reaction mechanism of ZrH2, a high-density metal hydride, in the combustion of a double-base propellant to evaluate its potential as a fuel. ZrH2 is determined to possess good resistance to oxidation by nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Thus its combustion starts with dehydrogenation to generate H2 and metallic Zr. Subsequently, the newly formed Zr and H2 participate in the combustion and, especially, Zr melts and then combusts on the burning surface which favors the heat feedback to the propellant. This phenomenon is completely different from the combustion behavior of the traditional fuel Al, where the Al particles are ejected off the burning surface of the propellant to get into the luminous flame zone to burn. The findings in this work validate the potential of ZrH2 as a hydrogen-supplying fuel for double-base propellants.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192708,2017,On the combustion mechanisms of ZrH2 in double-base propellant.,n
312,"A small number of key-residues in a protein sequence play vital roles in the function, stability, and folding of the protein. The nonuniform conformational disorder of a small protein Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI2) and its secondary segments has been quantified in the ethanol governed temperature induced unfolding process by estimating its change in configurational entropy in several water-ethanol mixed solutions. Such calculations further assist us in identifying the key-residues, from where the unfolding of the protein was initiated. Our findings match well with the reported experimental results. We then make an attempt to explore the properties of the solvent water and ethanol around the key-residues of the protein in its folded and unfolded forms at ambient temperature to identify the individual role of ethanol and water in the protein unfolding. We find that the key-residues of the unfolded protein are in good contact with both water and ethanol as compared to those of the folded protein. In the presence of ethanol, water molecules are noticed to form a rigid structurally bound solvation layer around the key-residues of the protein, irrespective of its conformational state. The restricted translational motion and prominent caging effect of the water and ethanol molecules present around the key-residues of the unfolded protein are a signature of the existence of a rigid mixed water-ethanol layer as compared to that around the folded protein. Furthermore, comparable restricted structural relaxation of the key-residue-water and key-residue-ethanol hydrogen bonds in the unfolded protein as compared to that in the folded one implies that the formation of a strong long-lived hydrogen bonding environment nourishes the unfolding process. We believe that our findings will shed light to several co-solvent governed unfolding processes of a protein in general.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192709,2017,Conformational disorder and solvation properties of the key-residues of a protein in water-ethanol mixed solutions.,n

The relaxation studies were performed in the frequency range of 4 kHz-40 MHz and the temperature range of 223-248 K for different concentrations of the IL; the ratio (no. of moles of IL/no. of moles of SiO2) yields: 1/2, 3/5 and 7/10. A thorough analysis of this large set of experimental data was performed assuming the existence of two fractions of the liquid: a core fraction (near the pore center) and a surface fraction (near the confining walls). It was shown for all concentrations that the confinement does not significantly affect the translational motion near the pore center compared to the dynamics in bulk. The diffusion coefficients in the surface fraction are considerably smaller compared to the core fraction (from one to two orders of magnitude) and the difference becomes larger with increasing temperature. The diffusion coefficients become smaller for higher concentrations - this effect is not large, but visible. Very importantly, it was shown that, despite the interactions with the surface, the diffusion in the surface fraction remains of 3D character. As far as rotational dynamics in the surface fraction is concerned, it slows down compared to the bulk (and the core fraction), but this effect is of the order of factor 2-3.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192710,2017,Dynamical properties of EMIM-SCN confined in a SiO2 matrix by means of 1H NMR relaxometry.,n
314,"The oxidation of ammonium in the vadose zone of soil aquifer systems is discussed and examined by detailed analysis of the depth profiles of dissolved oxygen, nitrate and ammonium concentrations in the vadose zone of a soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) system of a municipal wastewater treatment system of the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Nitrification kinetics and ammonium adsorption capacity studies show that neither the nitrification rate nor the ammonium adsorption capacity controls the capacity of the Shafdan SAT system for ammonium removal. Evaluation of the ammonium adsorption capacity of the soil reveals that under ideal conditions, a depth of less than 50 cm is sufficient to adsorb all the ammonium supplied in a flooding cycle. In-field studies show that all the ammonium is concentrated within the first 80 cm of the vadose zone. A depth profile of the Potential Nitrification (P.N), a measure of the local amount and activity of nitrifiers, is presented for the first time in the vadose zone of a SAT system showing that there are sufficient nitrifiers to oxidize all the ammonia that is supplied in a flooding cycle within less than 2 h, under optimal microbiological conditions based on the existing nitrifiers and their spatial distribution. The biodegradation rate in the field corresponds to first order ammonium conversion with a kinetic coefficient of 8.0 Â± 0.2 d-1. Accordingly, the average measured rate was 8.6 Â± 5.8 mg NH4+-N per kg per d for in-field tests, which can be compared to the average P.N, with a value of 34.5 Â± 16.8 mg NH4+-N per kg per d. The results suggest that a SAT design, taking into account full ammonium removal capacity, is feasible and can rely on the evaluation of the ammonium adsorption capacity in the SAT soil, the ammonium input and the P.N of the equilibrated target soil under conditions simulating the operation of the infiltrating basins.",England,Environmental science.

315,"The crystalline-Si/amorphous-SiO2 (c-Si/a-SiO2) interface is an important system used in many applications, ranging from transistors to solar cells. The transition region of the c-Si/a-SiO2 interface plays a critical role in determining the band alignment between the two regions. However, the question of how this interface band offset is affected by the transition region thickness and its local atomic arrangement is yet to be fully investigated. Here, by controlling the parameters of the classical Monte Carlo bond switching algorithm, we have generated the atomic structures of the interfaces with various thicknesses, as well as containing Si at different oxidation states. A hybrid functional method, as shown by our calculations to reproduce the GW and experimental results for bulk Si and SiO2, was used to calculate the electronic structure of the heterojunction. This allowed us to study the correlation between the interface band characterization and its atomic structures. We found that although the systems with different thicknesses showed quite different atomic structures near the transition region, the calculated band offset tended to be the same, unaffected by the details of the interfacial structure. Our band offset calculation agrees well with the experimental measurements. This robustness of the interfacial electronic structure to its interfacial atomic details could be another reason for the success of the c-Si/a-SiO2 interface in Si-based electronic applications. Nevertheless, when a reactive force field is used to generate the a-SiO2 and c-Si/a-SiO2 interfaces, the band offset significantly deviates from the experimental values by about 1 eV.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192712,2017,Effects of the c-Si/a-SiO2 interfacial atomic structure on its band alignment: an ab initio study.,n

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of EGFR mutation status in blood against that in tumor tissues as the reference. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether blood can be used as a substitute for tumor tissue in detecting EGFR mutations.


METHODS
Investigations that provided data on EGFR mutation status in blood were searched in the databases of Medline, Embase, Ovid Technologies and Web of Science. The detect efficiency of EGFR mutations in paired blood and tissues was compared using a random-effects model of meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity and diagnostic accuracy were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve.


RESULTS
A total of 19 studies with 2,922 individuals were involved in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed the positive detection rate of EGFR mutations in lung cancer tissues was remarkably higher than that of paired blood samples (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, p<0.001). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of blood were 0.65 and 0.91, respectively, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89.

Cell sources for cardiovascular tissue engineering (TE) are scant. However, the need for an ideal TE cardiovascular implant persists. We investigated the cardiotomy reservoir (CR) as a potential cell source that is more accessible and less ethically problematic.


METHODS
CR (n = 10) were removed from the bypass system after surgery. Isolation was performed using different isolation methods: blood samples were taken from the cardiopulmonary bypass and centrifuged at low density. The venous filter screen was cut out and placed into petri dishes for cultivation. The spongelike filter was removed, washed and treated in the same way as the blood samples. After cultivation, cell lines of fibroblasts (FB) and endothelial cells (EC) were obtained for analysis. The cells were seeded on polyurethane patches and analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Life/Dead assay and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
No correlation between age, time of surgery and quality of cells was observed. The successful extraction of FB and was proven by positive staining results for TE-7, CD31 and vWF. Cell morphology, cytoskeleton staining and quantification of proliferation using WST-1 assay resembled the cells of the control group in all ways. The topography of a confluent and vital cell layer after cell seeding was displayed by SEM analysis, Life/Dead Assay and immunohistochemistry.

Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF)-associated reactive angioendotheliomatosis (RAE) is a very rare entity (three previously reported cases in the literature) that can manifest as extremity wounds. RAE's etiopathology is unknown.


CASE DESCRIPTION
We report a case of severe limb-threatening upper extremity wound with pathology-proven RAE. This lesion was previously refractory to standard wound care. There was no evidence of limb ischemia or steal syndrome, previously deemed to be the underlying cause of AVF-associated RAE in other reports.


CONCLUSIONS
Successful endovascular treatment of an ipsilateral innominate vein stenosis led to reduction of venous hypertension, resolution of associated arm edema, and subsequent wound healing. We therefore propose that venous engorgement and hypertension from central venous stenosis is the likely underlying cause for AVF-associated RAE. If this rare entity is encountered in the setting of AVF, there is utility in treating the wound as a sentinel lesion and venography should be conducted to rule out central venous pathology. Vascular intervention complements aggressive local wound management and biopsy is requisite for prompt diagnosis.",Italy,The journal of vascular access,29192720,2017,Resolution of reactive angioendotheliomatosis in an arteriovenous fistula with innominate vein angioplasty.,n

Despite the growing number of haemodialysis (HD) patients in India, little is known about vascular access practice. We investigated the use and cost of different vascular accesses by Indian nephrologists.


METHODS
An online survey was emailed to 920 Indian nephrologists and 388 (42.1%) responded; 98.5% of whom were responsible for managing dialysis patients, 98% in hospitals.


RESULTS
Sixty-four percent of patients initiated renal replacement therapy with HD, 7% with peritoneal dialysis, 10% kidney transplantation and 19% conservative care. Forty-eight percent of patients were self-paying, 26% had employee reimbursement and 23% had insurance. According to 59% of responders, more than three-quarters of patients started dialysis with uncuffed catheter, less than one-quarter started dialysis with fistula; and very few used grafts or tunnelled catheters. Among prevalent HD patients, over half were dialysing with fistula (79% nephrologists), rather than uncuffed catheters (15% nephrologists) or grafts (<1% nephrologists). Sixteen percent reported at least one catheter-related sepsis in more than half of patients. Placement of uncuffed catheters cost US$160 in 92% facilities, whereas tunnelled catheters cost US$320 in 46% of facilities. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) could be created for US$160 in 40%, and US$320 in 90% of centres. Thirty-five percent of nephrologists reported that grafts were not placed at their institute and where they were available, the average cost was over US$480. Forty-six percent of nephrologists had access to pre-dialysis clinics, <30% to vascular access programmes, and <17% conducted regular vascular access audits.


CONCLUSIONS
The survey provides a snapshot of the current status of vascular access care in HD patients and highlights need for pre-dialysis clinics, vascular access services and registry audits.",Italy,The journal of vascular access,29192721,2017,Haemodialysis vascular access: current practices amongst Indian nephrologists.,n

The proximal cephalic vein that enters the axillary vein (cephalic arch) is a common site of stenosis in patients with upper extremity arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis (HD). In this study, we present the outcomes of a series of cephalic vein transposition, to determine its utility in the setting of refractory arch stenosis.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing cephalic vein transposition to manage refractory cephalic arch stenosis from January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2015. Demographics, past medical history, access history of the patients as well as procedural details of the surgery to the stenotic segment, patency of the access, and the need for subsequent interventions were recorded.


RESULTS
Twenty-three patients underwent a cephalic vein transposition during the study period. The patients undergoing cephalic transposition had their current access for an average of 3.0 Â± 2.6 years and had an average of 2.3 Â± 0.9 interventions on the access prior to the surgery. Complications from the surgery were uncommon (8.7%) and no patient required a temporary tunneled dialysis catheter. The re-intervention rate was 0.2 Â± 0.2 interventions per patient per year. At two years, primary patency was 70.9% and cumulative patency was 94.7% for the patients with cephalic transposition.


CONCLUSIONS
Cephalic vein transposition is safe and effective treatment for cephalic arch stenosis without interrupting utilization of the access. The surgical approach to stenosis of the proximal cephalic vein is effective, requires minimal re-interventions, and should be considered for isolated, refractory cephalic arch stenosis in mature arteriovenous fistulas.",Italy,The journal of vascular access,29192722,2017,Cephalic vein transposition is a durable approach to managing cephalic arch stenosis.,n
326,"PURPOSE
To study the effect of x-ray radiotherapy on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and elucidate the mechanisms in preventing neointimal hyperplasia of prosthetic vascular grafts.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In model I, twelve mongrel dogs underwent revascularization with prosthetic grafts and half the dogs underwent irradiation of the grafts at 28 Gy. In model II, human VSMCs (hVSMCs) were maintained and divided into six groups to which external radiation was applied at six different doses: 0 Gy, 2 Gy, 8 Gy, 16 Gy, 24 Gy and 30 Gy. In both models, specimens were harvested and examined by using morphological, immunological, cellular and molecular methods.


RESULTS
After irradiation, the neointima thickness was significantly lower in irradiated groups (pâ‰¤0.01). The radiotherapy could up-regulate p27kip1, and down-regulate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and S phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2). X-ray irradiation inhibits the proliferation of hVSMCs via acting on G1/S phase of cell cycle. The apoptosis of hVSMCs increased significantly with dose and time. The expression of PCNA and Skp2 were decreased after a first increasing trend with dose, but had a significant negative correlation with time. The expression of p27kip1 had a significant positive correlation with dose and time.


CONCLUSIONS
Postoperative external fractionated irradiation after prosthetic vessel replacement of the abdominal aorta suppressed the development of hyperplasia in the graft neointima in the short term. There was a prominent time- and dose-dependent inhibition of VSMC proliferation by radiation when it was administered.",Italy,The journal of vascular access,29192723,2017,Radiation suppresses neointimal hyperplasia through affecting proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells.,n

The study evaluated the Heparin Bioactive Surface (HBS) Viabahn Stent (W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, -Flagstaff, Arizona) efficacy in the maintenance or re-establishment of hemodialysis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fifty HBS Viabahn stents deployed in 37 consecutive patients with hemodialysis dysfunction from January 2008 to May 2016 were evaluated in a single-institution retrospective review.Outcomes were stent patency intended as primary circuit patency (PP), assisted primary patency (APP), target lesion primary patency (TLPP) and secondary patency (SP).Moreover, the risk factor analysis for hemodialysis dysfunction that required reintervention was performed. A subgroup analysis was conducted to assess patency of Viabahn stent to treat peripheral venous long segment obstruction (LSO).


RESULTS
Overall Kaplan-Meyer PPs were 60% at 12 months and 42% at 24 months. Overall TLPP estimated rates were 68% and 49% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The corresponding SP rates were 85% and 78% at the same period. Estimated PP rates at 12 and 24 months for stent placement after peripheral venous long segment recanalization procedure were 53% and 31%, respectively. Corresponding SP rates were 82% and 68%, respectively. The APP rates were 79% at 12 months and 61% at 24 months.Female sex, access age and thrombosis were associated with reduced primary patency.


CONCLUSIONS
Considering the high rates of PP, TLPP, APP and SP, Viabahn stents have been proven effective in maintaining or re-establishing the hemodialysis access. Moreover, stent placement after recanalization of LSO of venous out-flow represented a valid approach to rescue a dysfunctional fistula that would otherwise be abandoned.",Italy,The journal of vascular access,29192725,2017,"Viabahn stent for hemodialysis shunt: efficacy, long segment recanalization and prognostic factors for reintervention.",n

The residual hip deformities after Legg-CalvÃ©-Perthes disease (LCPD) cause mechanical symptoms and are associated with a pathomechanical environment that can feature femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes in residual or healed LCPD after arthroscopic treatment.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed patients with LCPD amongst patients with FAI who underwent arthroscopic treatment between January 2009 and June 2013. We determined LCPD through 3-dimensional computed tomographic scans and simple radiography of the hip joint. The clinical outcomes were rated using a visual analogue scale pain score (VAS), the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) and hip range of motion (ROM) preoperatively and at the 2-year follow-up. All radiographs were assessed using the TÃ¶nnis classification system preoperatively and at the final follow-up of each patient. There were 23 patients (14 men, 9 women) with mean age 26.4 (range, 16-49) years undergoing arthroscopic treatment for FAI symptoms because of residual or healed LCPD.


RESULTS
At the 2-year follow-up, the mean VAS had improved significantly from 6.7 to 2.1, the mean mHHS had improved significantly from 62.6 to 87.4, and hip flexion and external rotation had improved significantly from 88.7Â° to 106.5Â° and from 20.4Â° to 33.5Â°, respectively (all p<0.001). The TÃ¶nnis osteoarthritis grade had not changed in any patient at the latest follow-up.

We have investigated the revision rates of all bearing surface combinations for primary total hip replacement (THR) registered on the New Zealand Joint Registry (NZJR) to determine which coupling has been the most durable and successful over the last 16 years.


METHODS
There were 106,139 primary THRs registered, resulting in 4,960 revisions for any cause. We examined all-cause revision rates, reasons for revision and performed survival analyses.


RESULTS
Ceramic-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene (CoPx) had the lowest all-cause revision rate of 0.54/100-component-years (cys) (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.61). This was superior to all other hard-on-soft bearing combinations in unadjusted analysis. Furthermore, the age of patients receiving CoPx was significantly lower than for metal-on-polyethylene (mean 62.9; standard deviation [SD] 10.1 vs. 69.1; SD 9.6; p<0.001). Acetabular loosening was the reason for revision in 14.5% of CoPx, compared to 33% of MoP THRs (p<0.001). Metal-on-metal bearings had the highest revision rate of 1.43/100 cys and were significantly inferior to CoPx (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analyses were performed and we adjusted the analyses to control for age, femoral head size, surgical approach and fixation.

The purpose of the present study was (i) to review the long-term outcome of cemented Charnley total hip replacements (THRs) performed by 1 surgeon (GH), 20 to 42 years ago, in patients â‰¥60 years, using both the Kaplan-Meier (KM) and the cumulative incidence (CI) methods, and (ii) to compare the estimations of the 2 statistical methods.


METHODS
We evaluated the outcome of 306 consecutive primary cemented THRs that were performed in 265 patients. The final clinical, radiographic assessment and satisfaction of living patients were also included. The survivorship was estimated with the use of KM and CI methods and the relative difference between their estimations was calculated.


RESULTS
Living patients' final clinical results were significantly improved in comparison with respective preoperative ones, and all the acetabular and 91% of femoral components considered as well fixed. 95% of these patients reported satisfaction. The risk of revision at 25 years, with revision for aseptic loosening for 1 or both components as the endpoint, with 21 hips at risk, assessed with KM analysis was 6.9% and with CI approach was 3.9%. The relative difference between KM and CI estimations was increasing during follow-up, reaching up to 76.8% at 25 years.


CONCLUSIONS
We concluded that fixation of implants with cement in older patients had satisfactory long-term results and can serve as a benchmark with which to compare newer fixation methods (hybrid and uncemented) and materials. However, KM method, in studies that include older population with long-term follow-up, may significantly overestimate the risk of revision and clinicians could consider using besides the cumulative incidence of competing risk method.",Italy,Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,29192728,2017,Overestimation of the risk of revision with Kaplan-Meier presenting the long-term outcome of total hip replacement in older patients.,n

The non-arthroplasty hip registry (NAHR) is a United Kingdom national register that monitors the efficacy of hip preservation surgery. We aim to highlight early experiences of incorporating the NAHR into our practice at a tertiary centre.


METHODS
Between December 2013 and February 2015, 381 patients were identified on the NAHR database that had undergone non-arthroplasty hip surgery. Patient-related outcome measures EuroQuol 5D-5L (EQ-5D) and the International Hip Outcome Tool 12 (iHOT-12) were recorded at baseline and 6 months.


RESULTS
The 289 arthroscopic surgeries showed a statistical significant difference (p<0.05) in iHOT-12 for both males (45.21-65.07) and females (34.57 to 55.53), and in EQ-5D for both males (0.59-0.75) and females (0.56-0.65). The 92 open procedures showed a statistical significant difference (p<0.05) in both iHOT-12 (31.71-62.42) and EQ-5D (0.54-0.68).

The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of a Technetium-99M (HDP) 3-phase bone scan (TPBS) as an additional diagnostic test in the evaluation of pain in the hip region following cemented total hip replacement (THR) surgery.


METHODS
A retrospective study over a 24-month period was performed comprising 100 patients investigated with a TPBS. Investigations were summarised and analysed, and were classified as entirely normal, possibly abnormal, and definitely abnormal.


RESULTS
45% (45) of TPBSs were reported as being entirely normal, 50% (50) as possibly abnormal, and 5% (5) as definitely abnormal. During the 24-month study period 230 revision THR procedures were performed at our institution; 10% (24) were investigated with TPBS and 90% (206) were not. 29% (7/24) of patients investigated with a TPBS that subsequently underwent revision THR surgery had an entirely normal preoperative TPBS. 84% (38) with an abnormal TPBS were managed conservatively. A TPBS had a sensitivity of 29% (95% confidence interval (CI), 13%-51%) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI, 38%-62%) in the detection of infection, or loosening with concurrent infection.


CONCLUSION
A TPBS should only be considered following clinical evaluation, serological investigation, diagnostic imaging and microbiological analysis of fluid obtained from arthrocentesis by a specialist revision arthroplasty surgeon. A TPBS may be useful in the situation where abnormal serology is present, but where repeated joint aspirations samples are inconclusive.",Italy,Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,29192730,2017,3-phase Technicium-99m bone scanning in patients with pain in the hip region after cemented total hip replacement: a multicentre series of 100 cases.,n

The design of the cementless Symax-HA femoral stem is based on geometrical analysis of human femoral anatomy to optimise the fit within the femur. The stem combines an anatomical proximal section enabling a metaphyseal anchorage with a straight distal section. This results in an improved proximal load transfer.We aimed to determine the overall survival of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients operated at our institution with the Symax stem. Secondly, we investigated the cause of revision for patients having THA including the Symax stem.


METHODS
The study is a registry study with results from a single centre, Vejle Hospital. From the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry, we identified all THAs operated with the Symax stem. The primary outcome was revision. The secondary outcomes were aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture, and all other causes for revision.


RESULTS
In total, 1,055 THAs were performed in 875 patients. The median 6.5-year survival rate was 97.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 96.6%-98.3%). 29 THAs had undergone revision due to the following causes: periprosthetic fracture (n = 11); aseptic loosening of the cup (n = 1); infection (n = 5); dislocation (n = 10); and component failure (n = 2). There was no revision due to aseptic loosening of the stem.


CONCLUSIONS
From the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry, we identified the overall 6.5-year survival rate to be 95% for cementless THAs.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is 1 of the most successful and frequent orthopaedic procedures around the world. Leg length discrepancy is reported in 1% to 60% of cases and is 1 of the most frequent causes of patient dissatisfaction and a common reason for litigation. The aim of this study was to compare leg length discrepancies following THA using 3 different intraoperative measuring methods.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We present a prospective cohort study of 454 hips undergoing THA for osteoarthritis between January 2009 and August 2016. We compared postoperative leg length discrepancy using 1 of the following 3 measurement methods: (1A) direct intraoperative comparison of the legs; (1B) measurement with a compass-like device with supra-acetabular fixation, involving length and offset; (1C, D) an intraoperative device that measures the trochanteric/joint ratio.


RESULTS
Leg length discrepancy >5 mm was present in 26% of the total study population. Direct intraoperative leg-to-leg assessment resulted in the greatest proportion of leg length discrepancy >5 mm (31%), followed by the compass group (27%) and the least discrepancy was observed in the trochanteric/joint ratio group (15%). The trochanteric/joint ratio assessment method resulted in the greatest reduction in discrepancy when compared to the other methods: discrepancies of 5-10 mm fell by 48% (relative risk [RR] 0.40 CI [confidence interval [CI] 95%, 0.22-0.74), and discrepancies of â‰¥10 mm fell by 59% (RR 0.52; CI 95%, 0.32-0.84).

Total hip arthroplasties (THAs) in younger patients are becoming increasingly popular. However, the outcome of subsequent revisions in younger patients is not well known and, therefore, their success (subsequent revision prosthesis survival) might be overestimated. We investigated available data on the outcome of primary- and subsequent revision THAs performed in the same cohort of patients who underwent primary THA under the age of 50.


METHODS
Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) were searched up until April 13, 2016 for studies that reported both the survival of primary and subsequent revisions THA of single cohorts of patients younger than 50. Eligible articles had to include Kaplan Meier analysis or competing risk analysis for survival of the primary THA at a mean follow-up of 10 years, as well as for the subsequent revision THA within the same cohort.


RESULTS
We found 4,799 unique records; 43 of which were potentially eligible. Only 1 paper met our inclusion criteria. It reported on the survival of 69 primary prostheses at a mean of more than 10 years follow-up and 13 subsequent revisions.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a clear lack of evidence about the outcomes of the revision arthroplasty in younger patients. Only 1 study reported the survival-rate of subsequent revision arthroplasty with the minimum 10-year survival rate of the original THA cohort. In the future, this serious lack of knowledge could result in a large number of patients with no further reconstructive options after failed THA, and a large medical burden for society.",Italy,Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,29192733,2017,Systematic review: lack of evidence for the success of revision arthroplasty outcome in younger patients.,n

The moderately cross-linked Depuy MarathonÂ® cemented acetabular component was introduced into the UK in 2007. The wear rate for the previously introduced MarathonÂ® uncemented acetabular component has been reported to range from 0.06 to 0.01 mm/year.The aim of this study was to present the medium-term results and wear rate of the MarathonÂ® cemented prosthesis used in primary total hip arthroplasty.


METHODS
103 MarathonÂ® cemented acetabular components were implanted between 2008 and 2009 in primary arthroplasty, who were eligible for this study. All patients received a metal 28-mm head. Mean age was 68 years (range 27-87). Mean clinical follow-up was 55 months (range 50-61). Mean radiological follow-up was 46 months (range 24-57). Wear was calculated on AP radiographs using computer-assisted uni-radiographic technique.


RESULTS
The mean wear was 0.37 mm (range 0.0-0.78 mm). The wear rate was calculated as 0.03 mm/year (95% confidence interval 0.02-0.06). Postoperative complications included deep vein thrombosis (2%) and dislocation (0.8%); there were no deep infections.

339,"PURPOSE
to report our initial experience with adjunctive hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy (PAO).


METHODS
Retrospective review of patients who underwent PAO and ipsilateral hip arthroscopy between 2003 and 2013. Indications for arthroscopy were mechanical symptoms and/or positive magnetic resonance imaging to suggest intra-articular pathology including chondrolabral lesions, ligamentum teres tears and hypertrophy, and synovitis. Preoperative TÃ¶nnis arthritis grades, age, sex, operative findings and treatment, complications, and, if available, hip survival were recorded.


RESULTS
Of 78 patients (95 hips) included, 64 (82%) were female and 14 (18%) male, average age was 30.6 (14-63) years. TÃ¶nnis grades were 0 in 40 hips (42%), 1 in 45 hips (47%), and 2 in 10 hips (11%). No TÃ¶nnis 3 hips were included. 84% of hips demonstrated labral pathology. 92% had chondromalacia, which was severe enough in 4 patients to warrant cancellation of PAO; all 4 have subsequently required total hip replacement at short-term follow-up. Labral debridement was performed in 73 hips and refixation in 7. 5 postoperative complications occurred - none major, including 1 fluid extravasation, 1 case of heterotopic ossification, and 3 transient neuropraxias.


CONCLUSIONS
Intraarticular pathology is highly prevalent in patients undergoing PAO with mechanical symptoms, and can be safely managed by adjunctive arthroscopy. Complications were minimal in our series and are comparable to reports of PAO without arthroscopy. Arthroscopy can treat pathology that is inaccessible during standalone PAO and permits avoidance of routine arthrotomy, surgical dislocation, rectus release, and futile PAO in cases with severe articular damage.",Italy,Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,29192736,2017,Operative findings and complications associated with adjunctive hip arthroscopy in 95 hips undergoing periacetabular osteotomy.,n

Inguinal lymphadenectomy (iLAD) reduces mortality in patients with cN0 penile cancer but yields high complication rates. Thus, its prophylactic role has been questioned and dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) was introduced to select men who should undergo the procedure. Our aim was to investigate the accuracy of a contemporary DSNB cohort.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective analysis of â‰¥T1 or â‰¥G2 cN0 penile cancer undergoing perioperative DSNB from June 2009 to June 2015 at a tertiary referral center. We excluded men with <18 months follow-up or with local recurrence after primary curative treatment. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.


RESULTS
Thirty-five men underwent DSNB; 85.71% had â‰¤T2 penile cancer with â‰¤G2a histology. Per groin detection rate was 80% (scintigraphy being positive bilaterally in 60% and unilaterally in 20.0%). In no cases did DSNB prolong the postoperative course compared to primary surgery. Nine men (n = 15/109 nodes removed) had positive results, 8 of whom underwent iLAD. Among negative DSNB patients, 2 developed nodal penile cancer recurrence; none of them had node biopsy due to inconclusive scintigraphy. At a median follow-up of 42 months (interquartile range 30-78 months), if considering only men with scintigraphy detected inguinal nodes, per-patient sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 80% whereas positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 25% and 92.3%, respectively.

Signet-ring cell (SRC) carcinoma is a common subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma associated with poor prognosis. Metastatic involvement of the parotid gland has been reported in gastric cancer patients, but never bilaterally nor in association with the SRC histotype. Here, we report the first case and a brief review of the literature.


CASE DESCRIPTION
A 47-year-old woman was referred to our center for a signet-ring gastric carcinoma with synchronous hepatic and peritoneal metastases. After 3 lines of chemotherapy, the patient reported a progressive bilateral enlargement in the periauricolar area. An ultrasound of the salivary glands and a fine needle biopsy were diagnostic for parotid metastases of gastric origin. In the literature, only 3 cases of parotid gland metastases arising from gastric cancer are described - none with a feature of SRC carcinoma.


CONCLUSIONS
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of gastric SRC carcinoma with bilateral parotid metastases. This case highlights the importance of considering a parotid enlargement as a possible sign of disease progression in a patient with gastric cancer.

344,"PURPOSE
Two randomized trials in the cytokine era showed that cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) had a role in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), increasing life expectancy. The survival benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including first-line sunitinib and pazopanib, in mRCC has been demonstrated, but the majority of patients enrolled in the pivotal phase III studies had undergone nephrectomy. Therefore it is unknown if similar survival benefit with targeted agents could be achieved without CN. We hypothesize that in these patients CN could increase overall survival (OS) in comparison to targeted therapy without CN. We also will investigate mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to TKIs in patients with mRCC and identify prognostic or predictive biomarkers.


METHODS
This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter phase 3 study comparing sunitinib or pazopanib vs CN followed by sunitinib or pazopanib as first-line therapy for patients with mRCC who have not received surgery and prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease. We will identify 270 patients eligible for randomization. The planned treatment duration per patient will be until progressive disease is observed. Secondary endpoints are the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate and the assessment of the safety profile. Exploratory objectives include the evaluation of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA and correlation with response/resistance to treatment.


RESULTS
The study is enrolling patients.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of CN in addition to targeted therapy in patients with renal cell carcinoma with synchronous metastases could lead to a significant improvement in OS and PFS.",Italy,Tumori,29192741,2017,TARIBO trial: targeted therapy with or without nephrectomy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: liquid biopsy for biomarkers discovery.,n

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue malignant musculoskeletal tumor frequent in children. Biliary duct localization is extremely rare, but it is the most common cause of malignant obstructive jaundice in pediatric patients.


METHODS
This report describes a series of 10 patients under 18 years of age with biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma who were enrolled, from 1979 to 2004, in 3 consecutive Italian pediatric cooperative protocols that had been drawn up by the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP).


RESULTS
Considering initial and delayed surgery, tumor resection was achieved in 7 cases, 3 complete with free margins (2 liver transplants) and 4 with microscopic residual disease. Chemotherapy was given to all patients and radiotherapy to 3. At present, 5 patients survive in complete remission 90-200 months after diagnosis while 4 died of disease progression or relapse and 1 of liver transplant-related complications.


CONCLUSIONS
Better outcomes in this series were associated with the feasibility of conservative surgery due to the favorable location of the tumor, in particular in the common bile duct. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy might obviate the need for demolitive surgery or liver transplant, which were linked to worse outcomes in our series.",Italy,Tumori,29192742,2017,Biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma: a report from the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica.,n
346,"INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Its diagnosis is often delayed and patients are frequently found to have unresectable disease. Patients diagnosed with new-onset diabetes have an 8-fold risk of harboring pancreatic cancer. Adrenomedullin has been claimed to mediate diabetes in pancreatic cancer. New screening tools are needed to develop an early diagnosis protocol.


METHODS
Patients aged 45-75 years within 2 years of first fulfilling the ADA criteria for diabetes will be prospectively enrolled in this study. Sepsis, renal failure, microangiopathy, pregnancy, acute heart failure and previous malignancies will be considered as exclusion criteria.


RESULTS
440 patients diagnosed with new-onset diabetes will be enrolled and divided into 2 groups: one with high adrenomedullin levels and one with low adrenomedullin levels. Patients will undergo 3 years' follow-up to detect pancreatic cancer development.


CONCLUSIONS
Identifying a marker for pancreatic cancer among high-risk patients such as new-onset diabetics might lead to the identification of a subpopulation needing to be screened in order to enable early diagnosis and treatment of a highly lethal tumor.

347,"BACKGROUND
Accurate measurement of outcomes is essential to monitor the effectiveness of public health policies. In Italy, the Ministry of Health has chosen 30-day mortality after major surgical or medical procedures as the main outcome measure, pooling all pulmonary resections for malignancy in a single category. The present audit evaluated all pulmonary resections performed over a 13-year period in a single institution to assess the immediate (30-day mortality) and long-term (5-year survival) outcomes according to type and stage of disease and extent of surgery.


METHODS
We analyzed the results of 4,234 first pulmonary resections performed from 2003 to 2015 for lung cancer (2,636), lung metastases (1,080), other primary cancers (259) and benign diseases (259). The median follow-up of cancer patients was 4.1 years.


RESULTS
Overall 30-day mortality was 1.1%, being 1.2% for lung cancer, 0.3% for lung metastases, 3.5% for pneumonectomies, 1% for lobectomies, and 0.5% for sublobar resections. Among lung cancer patients, 30-day mortality was 0.7% for simple anatomical resections, 2.8% for complex resections, 0.7% for stage I, and 1.6% for higher stages. Overall 5-year survival was 56% for lung cancer, 49% for lung metastases, and 53% for other primary cancers (p = 0.03). According to the surgical procedure for lung cancer, 5-year survival was 60%, 55% and 36% for lobectomies, segmentectomies and pneumonectomies, respectively (p<0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
For better monitoring of thoracic surgery outcomes in a real-world setting, we suggest evaluating lung cancer separately from other thoracic malignancies, and including 5-year survival rates stratified by resection volume and surgical procedure complexity.",Italy,Tumori,29192744,2017,"Thirty-day mortality and five-year survival in thoracic surgery: ""real-world"" assessment of outcomes from a single-institution audit.",n
348,"PURPOSE
Despite the common occurrence of adenomyosis in endometrial cancer (EC), there is a paucity and conflict in the literature regarding its impact on outcomes of patients. We sought to compare outcomes of patients with endometrioid type EC with or without adenomyosis.


METHODS
A total of 314 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis was identified in 79 patients (25.1%). A propensity score-matched comparison (1:1) was carried out to minimize selection biases. The propensity score was developed through multivariable logistic regression model including age, stage, and tumor grade as covariates. After performing propensity score matching, 70 patients from each group were successfully matched. Primary outcome of the study was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).


RESULTS
Median follow-up time was 61 months for the adenomyosis positive group and 76 months for the adenomyosis negative group. There were no statistically significant differences in 3- and 5-year DFS, OS, and DSS rates between the 2 groups. Five-year DFS was 92% vs 88% (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54 [0.56-4.27]; p = 0.404), 5-year OS was 94% vs 92% (HR 1.60 [0.49-5.26]; p = 0.441), and 5-year DSS was 94% vs 96% (HR 2.51 [0.46-13.71]; p = 0.290) for patients with and without adenomyosis, respectively.

355,"Herein we present the application of a novel graphene oxide - polydimethylsiloxane (GO-PDMS) composite in reversible adsorption/desorption including detection of heavy metals. GO-PDMS was fabricated by simple blending of GO with silicon monomer in presence of tetrahydrofuran, followed by polymerization initiated upon curing agent addition. We found GO concentration, curing agent concentration, pH and contact time among the most important factors affecting the adsorption of Pb(II) used as a model heavy metal. The mechanism of adsorption is based on surface complexation, where oxygen active groups of negative charge can bind with bivalent metal ions Me(II). In order to demonstrate a practical application of this material, we fabricated microfluidic Lab-on-a-chip platform for heavy metals preconcentration and detection. This device consists of a screen-printed carbon electrode, a PDMS chip, and a GO-PDMS chip. The use of GO-PDMS preconcentration platform significantly improves the sensitivity of electrochemical detection of heavy metals (an increase of current up to 30x was observed), without the need of modifying electrodes or special reagents addition. Therefore, samples being so far below the limit of detection (0.5 ppb) were successfully detected. This approach is compatible also with real samples (sea water) as ionic strength was found as indifferent for the adsorption process.

358,"In respect to the intriguing biocompatibility and the stealthy functions of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), PEGylated nanoparticulates have been intensively engineered for utilities as drug delivery vehicles. To advocate the targeted drug transportation, targeting ligands were strategically installed onto the surface of PEGylated nanoparticulates. The previous in vitro investigations revealed that the ligand-specified cell endocytosis of nanoparticulates was pronounced for the nanoparticulates with adequately high PEG crowdedness. The present study aims to explore insight into the impact of PEGylation degree on in vivo tumor-targeted accumulation activities of cRGD-installed nanoparticulates. The subsequent investigations verified the importance of the PEGylation crowdedness in pursuit of prolonged retention in the blood circulation post intravenous administration. Unprecedentedly, the PEGylation crowdedness was also identified as a crucial important parameter to pursue the tumor-targeted accumulation. A plausible reason is the elevated PEGylation crowdedness eliciting the restricted involvement in non-specific protein adsorption of nanoparticulates in the biological milieu and consequently pronouncing the ligand-receptor-mediated binding for the nanoparticulates. Noteworthy was the distinctive performance of the class of the proposed systems once utilized for transportation of the mRNA payload to the tumors. The protein expression in the targeted tumors appeared to follow a clear PEGylation crowdedness dependence manner, where merely twofold PEGylation crowdedness led to remarkably tenfold augmentation in protein expression in tumors.

361,"The biosynthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) - which include teicoplanin and vancomycin - is a complex enzymatic process relying on the interplay of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and a Cytochrome P450-mediated cyclization cascade. This unique cyclization cascade generates the highly crosslinked state of these non-ribosomal peptides, which is crucial for their antimicrobial activity. Given that these essential oxidative transformations occur whilst the peptide remains bound to the terminal module of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) machinery, it is important to assess the selectivity of the terminal thioesterase (TE) domain and how this domain contributes to the maintenance of an efficient biosynthetic pathway whilst at the same time ensuring GPA maturation is completed. In this study, we report the in vitro characterization of the thioesterase domain from teicoplanin biosynthesis, the first GPA thioesterase to be characterized. Our results show that the activity of this TE-domain relies on the presence of an unusual extended N-terminal linker region that appears to be unique to the NRPS machineries found in GPA biosynthesis. In addition, we show that the activity of this domain against carrier protein bound substrates is dramatically enhanced for mature GPA aglycones as opposed to linear peptides and partially cyclized intermediates. These results demonstrate how the interplay between NRPS and P450s during late stage GPA biosynthesis is not only maintained but also leads to the efficient production of mature GPA aglycones. Thus, GPA TE-domains represent another impressive example of the ability of TE-domains to act as logic gates during NRPS biosynthesis, ensuring that essential late-stage peptide modifications are completed before catalyzing the release of the mature, bioactive peptide product.",United States,ACS chemical biology,29192758,2017,The thioesterase domain in glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis is selective for crosslinked aglycones.,n

367,"We previously described the photoactivated depot or PAD approach that allows for the light control of therapeutic protein release. This approach relies on the ability to use light to change a protein's solubility. Traditionally this was accomplished by linking the protein to an insoluble but injectable polymer via a light cleaved linker. This allows the injected material to remain at the site of injection, until transcutaneous irradiation breaks the link between polymer and protein, permitting the protein to be absorbed. However, there are multiple problems associated with polymer based approaches: The polymer makes up a majority of the material, making it inefficient. In addition, after protein release, the polymer has to be cleared from the body, a significant design challenge. In this work, we create materials that form photoactivated depots of insulin without the need for polymers, by linking photolysis to an isoelectric point shift, which itself is linked to a solubility shift. Specifically, we linked basic groups to insulin via a light cleaved linker. These shift the normal pI of insulin from 5.4 to approximately 7. The result of this incorporation are materials that are completely soluble in mildly acidic solutions but precipitate upon injection into a pH 7 environment, i.e., the skin. We successfully synthesized four such modified insulins, demonstrating that their pI values were shifted in the expected manner. We then analyzed one of them, P2-insulin, in detail, demonstrating that it behaves as designed: It is soluble in a formulation pH of 4, but precipitates at pH 7.2, its approximate pI value. Upon irradiation, the photocleavable link to insulin is broken, and completely native and soluble insulin is released from the depot in a well behaved, first order fashion. These materials are 90% therapeutic, form completely soluble and injectable formulations in mildly acidic conditions, form insoluble depots at neutral pH, efficiently release soluble protein from these depots when irradiated, and leave behind only small easily absorbed molecules after irradiation. As such they approach ideality for photoactivated depot materials.",United States,Journal of the American Chemical Society,29192764,2017,Light Control of Protein Solubility Through Isoelectric Point Modulation.,n
368,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely distributed throughout the atmosphere as mixtures attached to ambient particulate matter (PM). PAHs usually elicit similar toxicological pathways but do so with varying levels of efficacy. In this study, we utilized high-throughput screening (HTS) in vitro data of PAHs to predict health risks associated with coarse and fine PM. PM samples with 22 PAH compounds obtained from residential areas close to industrial parks in central Taiwan were analyzed. On the basis of the PM-bound PAH concentrations and their activities reported in HTS assays, we developed a probabilistic model for estimating cumulative exposure of humans to PAHs. Activity-to-exposure ratio (AER) values were calculated to compare relative risks of activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and tumor suppressor gene (p53) when children or adults were exposed to fine or coarse PM in different seasons. On the basis of AER values, the risk of fine PM exposure was relatively higher than the risk of exposure to coarse PM in pathway activation. Children as a susceptible population had a risk of the activating AhR pathway greater than that of adults. Particularly higher risks were observed in winter than in summer.

369,"We report here the intrinsic advantages of a special family of porous chalcogenides for CO2 adsorption in terms of high selectivity of CO2/N2, large uptake capacity, and robust structure due to their first-ever unique integration of the chalcogen-soft surface, high porosity, all-inorganic crystalline framework, and the tunable charge-to-volume ratio of exchangeable cations. Although tuning the CO2 adsorption properties via the type of exchangeable cations has been well-studied in oxides and MOFs, little is known about the effects of inorganic exchangeable cations in porous chalcogenides, in part because ion exchange in chalcogenides can be very sluggish and incomplete due to their soft character. We have demonstrated that, through a methodological change to progressively tune the host-guest interactions, both facile and nearly complete ion exchange can be accomplished. Herein, a series of cation-exchanged zeolitic chalcogenides (denoted as M@RWY) were studied for the first time for CO2 adsorption. Samples were prepared through a sequential ion-exchange strategy, and Cs+-, Rb+-, and K+-exchanged samples demonstrated excellent CO2 adsorption performance. Particularly, K@RWY has the superior CO2/N2 selectivity with the N2 adsorption even undetected at either 298 or 273 K. It also has the large uptake of 6.3 mmol/g (141 cm3/g) at 273 K and 1 atm with an isosteric heat of 35-41 kJ mol-1, the best among known porous chalcogenides. Moreover, it permits a facile regeneration and exhibits an excellent recyclability, as shown by the multicycling adsorption experiments. Notably, K@RWY also demonstrates a strong tolerance toward water.",United States,Inorganic chemistry,29192766,2017,Cation-Exchanged Zeolitic Chalcogenides for CO2 Adsorption.,n
370,"Traditional photodynamic therapy for cancer relies on dye-photosensitized generation of singlet oxygen. However, therapeutically effective singlet oxygen generation requires well-oxygenated tissues, whereas many tumor environments tend to be hypoxic. We describe a platform for targeted enhancement of photodynamic therapy that produces singlet oxygen in oxygenated environments and hydroxyl radical, which is typically regarded as the most toxic reactive oxygen species, in hypoxic environments. The 24-subunit iron storage protein bacterioferritin (Bfr) has the unique property of binding 12 heme groups in its protein shell. We inserted the isostructural photosensitizer, zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX (ZnP), in place of the hemes and extended the surface-exposed N-terminal ends of the Bfr subunits with a peptide targeting a receptor that is hyperexpressed on the cell surface of many tumors and tumor vasculature. We then loaded the inner cavity with ~2500 irons as a ferric oxyhydroxide polymer, and finally conjugated 2 kDa polyethylene glycol to the outer surface. We showed that the inserted ZnP photosensitizes generation of both singlet oxygen and the hydroxyl radical, the latter via the reaction of photo-released ferrous iron with hydrogen peroxide. This targeted iron-loaded ZnP-Bfr construct was endocytosed by C32 melanoma cells and localized to lysosomes. Irradiating the treated cells with light at wavelengths overlapping the ZnP Soret absorption band induced photosensitized intracellular Fe2+ release and substantial lowering of cell viability. This targeted, light-triggered production of intracellular singlet oxygen and Fenton-reactive iron could potentially be developed into a phototherapeutic adjunct for many types of cancers.",United States,Biomacromolecules,29192767,2017,A Trojan Horse for Light-Triggered Bifurcated Production of Singlet Oxygen and Fenton-Reactive Iron Within Cancer Cells.,n

Instead of forming a Mg-H bond upon reaction with dihydrogen or hydrosilanes, 2 and 3a,b underwent rapid silyl-silane exchange with hydrosilanes. Treating the ethyl complex [(Me3TACDÂ·AlEt3)MgEt] with H3SiPh gave [(Me3TACDÂ·AlEt3)MgH] (4), albeit not in a reproducible manner.

373,"In this review article, we consider the use of molecular oxygen in reactions mediated by polyoxometalates. Polyoxometalates are anionic metal oxide clusters of a variety of structures that are soluble in liquid phases and therefore amenable to homogeneous catalytic transformations. Often, they are active for electron transfer oxidations of a myriad of substrates and upon reduction can be reoxidized by molecular oxygen. For example, the phosphovanadomolybdate, H5PV2Mo10O40, can oxidize Pd(0) thereby enabling aerobic reactions catalyzed by Pd and H5PV2Mo10O40. In a similar vein, polyoxometalates can stabilize metal nanoparticles, leading to additional transformations. Furthermore, electron transfer oxidation of other substrates such as halides and sulfur-containing compounds is possible. More uniquely, H5PV2Mo10O40 and its analogues can mediate electron transfer-oxygen transfer reactions where oxygen atoms are transferred from the polyoxometalate to the substrate. This unique property has enabled correspondingly unique transformations involving carbon-carbon, carbon-hydrogen, and carbon-metal bond activation. The pathway for the reoxidation of vanadomolybdates with O2 appears to be an inner-sphere reaction, but the oxidation of one-electron reduced polyoxotungstates has been shown through intensive research to be an outer-sphere reaction. Beyond electron transfer and electron transfer-oxygen transfer aerobic transformations, there a few examples of apparent dioxygenase activity where both oxygen atoms are donated to a substrate.",United States,Chemical reviews,29192770,2017,Dioxygen in Polyoxometalate Mediated Reactions.,n

In order to further understand their antidiabetic potential, which has been previously demonstrated in animal models, we aimed to investigate the acute and chronic effects of major phenolic substances from both plants on insulin secretion and gene expression in pancreatic islets isolated from NMRI mice. Insulin secretion was measured after acute (1 h) and long-term (72 h) incubation of islets with one of four cinnamic acid derivatives (caftaric, caffeic, chicoric, and rosmarinic acids) or a C-glucosylated flavonoid (vicenin-2). All substances acutely enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from islets at concentrations from 10-10 to 10-6 M. They also increased GSIS after chronic incubation (10-8 M). None of them increased insulin secretion in the presence of low glucose concentration. Furthermore, these substances markedly changed the gene expression profile of key insulin regulatory genes INS1, INS2, PDX1, INSR, IRS1, and proliferative genes as well as glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), in treated islets. Thus, they may play an important role in diabetes treatment.

In present work, flowerlike porous LiFe5O8 microspheres etched for 15, 30, and 45 min (named as p-LFO-15, p-LFO-30, and p-LFO-45, respectively) are successfully synthesized through a facile chemical etching method based on bulk LiFe5O8 (LFO) particles as precursors, and they are applied as electrode materials for high-performance electrochemical capacitors. In particular, the specific surface area of p-LFO-45 reaches 46.13 m2 g-1, which is 112 times greater than that of the unetched counterpart. Therefore, the p-LFO-45 electrode can achieve a higher capacitance of 278 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 than the unetched counterpart. Furthermore, the p-LFO-45 electrode presents a good cycling stability with 78.3% of capacitive retention after 2000 cycles, which is much higher than that of the unetched LFO particles (66%).

Perturbation of the protein-protein interface has proven to be an efficient strategy to inactivate TNFÎ±, but the atomic resolution mechanism of its inactivation remains poorly understood. Here, we probe the solution structure and dynamics of active and inactive TNFÎ± using NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal that TNFÎ± undergoes motions on different timescales. Furthermore, we show by site directed mutagenesis at residues at the trimerization interface and by targeting the interface with a low molecular weight inhibitor, that TNFÎ± retains its overall structure and trimeric state. However, upon perturbation TNFÎ± exhibits increased conformational dynamics spanning from the trimerisation interface to the regions mediating receptor binding.

We report here on the identification and synthesis of new nitrogen-containing volatiles from Salinispora pacifica CNS863 and explore the occurrence in another bacterial lineage, exemplified by Roseobacter-group bacteria. Several compound classes not reported before from bacteria were identified, such as dialkyl ureas and oxalamides. Sulfinamides have not been reported before as natural products. The actinomycete S. pacifica CNS863 produces, for example, sulfinamides N-isobutyl- and N-isopentylmethanesulfinamide (5, 6), urea N,N'-diisobutylurea (16), and oxalamide N,N'-diisobutyloxalamide (17).

The chemical bonding has been studied in the gas phase in order to eliminate solvent effects. QTAIM analysis demonstrates features that are very similar in all complexes and typical for electrostatic M-O bonds, but with the M-O bonds in the uranyl peroxide systems about 20 kJ mol-1 stronger than in the corresponding crown ether complexes. The regular decrease in bond strength with increasing M-O bond distance is consistent with predominantly electrostatic contributions. Energy decomposition of the reaction energies in the gas phase and solvent demonstrates that the predominant component of the total attractive (Î”Eelec + Î”Eorb) energy contribution is the electrostatic component. There are no steric constraints for coordination of large cations to small rings, because the M+ ions are located outside the ring plane, [On], formed by the oxygen donors in the ligands; coordination of ions smaller than the ligand cavity results in longer than normal M-O distances or in a change in the number of bonds, both resulting in weaker complexes. The Gibbs energies, enthalpies, and entropies of reaction calculated using the conductor-like screening model, COSMO, to account for solvent effects deviate significantly from experimental values in water, while those in acetonitrile are in much better agreement. Factors that might affect the selectivity are discussed, but our conclusion is that present QC methods are not accurate enough to describe the rather small differences in selectivity, which only amount to 5-10 kJ mol-1. We can, however, conclude on the basis of QC and experimental data that M[crown ether]+ complexes in the strongly coordinating water solvent are of outer-sphere type, [M(OH2)n+][crown ether], while those in weakly coordinating acetonitrile are of inner-sphere type, [M-crown ether]+. The observation that the M[UO2(O2)(OH)(OH2)]n1-n complexes are more stable in solution than those of M[crown ether]+ is an effect of the different charges of the rings.",United States,Inorganic chemistry,29192779,2017,Structure and Bonding in Uranyl(VI) Peroxide and Crown Ether Complexes; Comparison of Quantum Chemical and Experimental Data.,n

EAL plays a role in human gut microbiome-based disease conditions, and physicochemical studies provide insight into protein structure and mechanism, toward potential therapeutics. Temperature dependences of the rotational correlation times (Ï„c; detection range, 10-11 â‰¤ Ï„c â‰¤ 10-7 s) and the corresponding weights of TEMPOL tumbling components from 200 to 265 K in the presence of EAL are measured in two frozen systems: (1) water-only and (2) 1% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the water-only condition, a protein-vicinal solvent component detectably fluidizes at 230 K and melts the surrounding ice-crystalline region with increasing T, creating a bounded, relatively high-viscosity aqueous solvent domain, up to 265 K.

397,"BACKGROUND
Although incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms appears to be a barrier to successful self-care, there are few studies examining the relationship between self-care and levels of comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.


AIM
To determine whether incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms is associated with self-care in heart failure patients who were recently discharged from the hospital due to heart failure exacerbation.


METHODS
Patients completed the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale and questionnaire to assess knowledge of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Three groups were formed by their different levels of understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether these three levels of understanding groups predicted self-care after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.


RESULTS
Of 571 patients 22.1%, 40.1% and 37.8% had poor, moderate, and complete understanding, respectively. Compared with patients in the poor understanding group, patients in complete and moderate understanding groups were more likely to have better adherence to self-care activities (standardized Î² = -0.14, 95% confidence interval -3.41, -0.47; standardized Î² = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -4.26, -1.23, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Fewer than half of the patients had a comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms, which was associated with poor self-care. Our study suggests that patient education should include contents to promote comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its symptoms, as well as the importance of self-care behaviors.",England,European journal of cardiovascular nursing : journal of the Working Group on Cardiovascular Nursing of the European Society of Cardiology,29192794,2017,Relationship between self-care and comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.,y

We determined serum leptin, soluble leptin receptor, adiponectin, bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), osteocalcin (OC), carboxylated-OC (Gla-OC), undercarboxylated-OC (Glu-OC), sclerostin, body composition, and bone mineral density (BMD) in 40 obese prepubertal children before and after therapy. The control group, matched for sex and age, consisted of 40 non-obese children.


RESULTS
We found that values of the total body less head-bone mineral content (TBLH-BMC) and TBLH-BMD were significantly increased, but TBLH-BMD Z-score was decreased by 25% (pÂ =Â 0.002) in obese children with weight loss after therapy. We observed increases of CTX-I to OC ratio (pÂ =Â 0.009), and Gla-OC concentrations (pÂ =Â 0.049). Changes in TBLH-BMD Z-score in patients were positively correlated with changes in BMI Z-score (pÂ =Â 0.001), percentage of fat mass (pÂ =Â 0.004), and BALP activity (pÂ =Â 0.01). Changes in BALP activity were negatively correlated (p < 0.001) with changes in adiponectin concentrations, while changes in sclerostin levels were positively correlated (pÂ =Â 0.001) with leptin changes.


CONCLUSIONS
We suggest that alterations in adipokines metabolism were associated with a lower rate of bone mineral accrual as a result of decreased bone formation rather than increased bone resorption. The lower rate of bone mass accrual in weight losing children may be an effect of reduced BALP levels related to increase in adiponectin levels.",England,Endocrine research,29192796,2017,"The effect of weight loss on body composition, serum bone markers, and adipokines in prepubertal obese children after 1-year intervention.",n
400,"BACKGROUND
To maximise the benefits obtainable from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, an evaluation of physical fitness using reliable, clinically relevant tests is strongly recommended. Recently, objective tests of physical fitness have been implemented in the SWEDEHEART register. The reliability of these tests has, however, not been examined for patients with acute coronary syndrome.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of the symptom-limited bicycle ergometer test, the dynamic unilateral heel-lift test and the unilateral shoulder-flexion test in patients with acute coronary syndrome.


METHODS
In a longitudinal study design, a total of 40 patients (mean age 63.8 Â± 9.5 years, five women), with ACS, aged < 75 years, were included at a university hospital in Sweden. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval, standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsiveness in terms of the minimal detectable change were calculated.


RESULTS
Excellent reliability was found, showing ICC values of 0.98 (0.96-0.99), SEM 4.71 for the bicycle ergometer test, ICC 0.87 (0.75-0.93), SEM 4.62 for the shoulder-flexion test and ICC 0.84 (0.71-0.91), SEM 2.24 for the heel-lift test. The minimal detectable change was 13 W, 13 and 6 repetitions for the bicycle ergometer test, shoulder-flexion and heel-lift tests respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The test-retest reliability of clinical tests evaluating physical fitness in patients with acute coronary syndrome included in the SWEDEHEART register was excellent. This makes the future comparison and evaluation of treatment effects in large unselected clinical populations of acute coronary syndrome possible.",England,European journal of cardiovascular nursing : journal of the Working Group on Cardiovascular Nursing of the European Society of Cardiology,29192797,2017,Test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of clinical tests of physical fitness in patients with acute coronary syndrome included in the SWEDEHEART register.,y

Reliability efforts include interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP) and Lean quality/process improvement strategies, which require skilful facilitation. Currently, no validated Lean facilitator assessment tool for interprofessional collaboration exists. This article describes the development and pilot evaluation of such a tool; the Interprofessional Lean Facilitator Assessment Scale (ILFAS), which measures both technical and 'soft' skills, which have not been measured in other instruments. The ILFAS was developed using methodologies and principles from Lean/Shingo, IPCP, metacognition research and Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains. A panel of experts confirmed the initial face validity of the instrument. Researchers independently assessed five facilitators, during six Lean sessions. Analysis included quantitative evaluation of rater agreement. Overall inter-rater agreement of the assessment of facilitator performance was high (92%), and discrepancies in the agreement statistics were analysed. Face and content validity were further established, and usability was evaluated, through primary stakeholder post-pilot feedback, uncovering minor concerns, leading to tool revision. The ILFAS appears comprehensive in the assessment of facilitator knowledge, skills, abilities, and may be useful in the discrimination between facilitators of different skill levels.

405,"Introduction Hypertension is one of the primary modifiable risk factors for cardiac and renal diseases. The prevalence of hypertension appears to be around 30-45% of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The administration of blood pressure-lowering drugs is to reduce the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes: stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths. Hypertension guidelines recommend combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk and with subclinical organ damage as well as when monotherapy fails. Areas covered As the etiology of essential hypertension is multifactorial, combination therapy using different classes of antihypertensive agents have greater effect than each on its own (synergistic effect), may have better tolerability (two components minimizing each other's side effects) and lead to improved patient compliance. Several studies assess the hypotensive efficacy on drug combination, there are also studies n triple drug combination. Expert commentary At present, dual and triple combination therapy is available to hypertensive patients with good clinical outcomes, compliance and low profile of side effects. Hypertensive patients usually have other cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. As patients' adherence to the pharmacological therapy significantly decreases the risk of long-term adverse events including mortality, use of single-pill combination therapy are not only good effects of free therapy but also better patient compliance. It appears that combinations not only of hypotensive drugs but also with statins will be widely used.

409,"OBJECTIVE
This study A) assessed whether levels of alcohol-related disciplinary actions on college campuses changed among MD college students after the 2011 Maryland (MD) state alcohol tax increase from 6% to 9%, and B) determined which school-level factors impacted the magnitude of changes detected.


METHOD
A quasi-experimental interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of panel data containing alcohol-related disciplinary actions on 33 MD college campuses in years 2006-2013. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in counts of alcohol-related disciplinary actions comparing time before and after the tax increase.


RESULTS
The ITS anaysis showed an insignificant relationship between alcohol-related disciplinary actions and tax implementation (Î² = -.27; p =.257) but indicated that alcohol-related disciplinary actions decreased significantly over the time under study (Î² = -.05; p =.022).


DISCUSSION
Alcohol related disciplinary actions did decrease over time in the years of study, and this relationship was correlated with several school-level characteristics, including school price, school funding type, types of degrees awarded, and specialty. School price may serve as a proxy mediator or confounder of the effect of time on disciplinary actions.",England,Substance use & misuse,29192806,2017,Impact of Alcohol Tax Increase on Maryland College Students' Alcohol-Related Outcomes.,y
410,"Autophagy represents a catabolic process in which cellular protein and organelles are engulfed into autophagosomes, digested in lysosomes and reutilized for the cellular metabolism. In neoplastic conditions, autophagy may act either as a tumour suppressor avoiding the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles or as a mechanism of cell survival promoting the tumour growth. Although enhanced autophagy has been reported in hypoxic areas of solid tumors, there are only few ultrastructural reports concerning the relationships between autophagy and tumor grade. In the present study, we have performed an ultrastructural investigation aimed to document autophagy in a cohort of advanced gastric carcinomas of tubular type, correlating the observed findings with low and high tumor grade. Among 71 surgically resected cases of advanced gastric carcinomas, we have selected twelve low-grade and thirteen high-grade tubular adenocarcinomas. Autophagic vacuoles (AV) were only occasionally found in low-grade tubular carcinomas, while they constituted a frequent finding in high-grade ones (pÂ <Â 0.01). Moreover, in high-grade tubular adenocarcinomas, our data revealed a morphologic association between autophagy and nuclear changes, such as multinucleation, micronucleation and nuclear buds, largely considered as ultrastructural aspects of mitotic instability. However, an increased autophagy was associated with organelle-poor cytoplasm or a senescent phenotype, characterized by lipofuscin granules and cytoplasmic vacuoles. In the light of our observations, it may be suggested that autophagy should be considered a phenomenon mainly related to the cellular differentiation and tumor progression.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192807,2017,Autophagy in advanced low- and high-grade tubular adenocarcinomas of the stomach: An ultrastructural investigation.,n

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques.


METHODS
Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6Â mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28Â days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations.


RESULTS
FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions.

438,"BACKGROUND
The American Thoracic Society committee on Proficiency Standards for Pulmonary Function Laboratories has recognized the need for a standardized reporting format for pulmonary function tests. Although prior documents have offered guidance on the reporting of test data, there is considerable variability in how these results are presented to end users, leading to potential confusion and miscommunication.


METHODS
A project task force, consisting of the committee as a whole, was approved to develop a new Technical Standard on reporting pulmonary function test results. Three working groups addressed the presentation format, the reference data supporting interpretation of results, and a system for grading quality of test efforts. Each group reviewed relevant literature and wrote drafts that were merged into the final document.


RESULTS
This document presents a reporting format in test-specific units for spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity that can be assembled into a report appropriate for a laboratory's practice. Recommended reference sources are updated with data for spirometry and diffusing capacity published since prior documents. A grading system is presented to encourage uniformity in the important function of test quality assessment.


CONCLUSIONS
The committee believes that wide adoption of these formats and their underlying principles by equipment manufacturers and pulmonary function laboratories can improve the interpretation, communication, and understanding of test results.",United States,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,29192835,2017,Recommendations for a Standardized Pulmonary Function Report.

439,"Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths. These results provide direct evidence for a causal link between processing preferences in individual speakers and patterns in linguistic diversity.",United States,Psychological science,29192836,2017,Human Information Processing Shapes Language Change.,y

A repeated-sprint test, consisting of 4Â Ã—Â 6 10Â m sprints, with 15Â s recovery period between sprints and 180Â s between sets, was conducted to evaluate total sprint time as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were best 10Â m sprint time (10mST) and sprint time during the last sprint (L10mST). Additionally, peak eccentric hamstring strength (ECC-PHS) and eccentric hamstring strength capacity (ECC-CAPHS) were measured during the NHE.

Activities were repeated twice, in the centre of the court and on the side. Participants wore a receiver tag (Clearsky T6, Catapult Sports) and two reflective markers placed on the tag to allow for comparisons with the criterion system (Vicon). Distance, mean and peak velocity, acceleration, and deceleration were assessed. Validity was assessed via percentage least-square means difference (Clearsky-Vicon) with 90% confidence interval and magnitude-based inference; typical error was expressed as within-subject standard deviation. The mean differences for distance, mean/peak speed, and mean/peak accelerations in the linear drills were in the range of 0.2-12%, with typical errors between 1.2 and 9.3%. Mean and peak deceleration had larger differences and errors between systems. In the COD drill, moderate-to-large differences were detected for the activity performed in the centre of the court, increasing to large/very large on the side. When filtered and smoothed following a similar process, the UWB-based positioning system had acceptable validity, compared to Vicon, to assess movements representative of indoor sports.",England,Journal of sports sciences,29192842,2017,Validity of an ultra-wideband local positioning system to measure locomotion in indoor sports.,n
446,The amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insights into AÎ²-interacting proteins are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity. We recently undertook an in-depth in vitro interrogation of the AÎ²1-42 interactome using human frontal lobes as the biological source material and taking advantage of advances in mass spectrometry performance characteristics. These analyses uncovered the small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) to be the most selectively enriched binder to oligomeric AÎ²1-42. Subsequent validation experiments revealed that SST interferes with AÎ² fibrillization and promotes the formation of AÎ² assemblies characterized by a 50-60Â kDa SDS-resistant core. The distributions of SST and AÎ² overlap in the brain and SST has been linked to AD by several additional observations. This perspective summarizes this body of literature and draws attention to the fact that SST is one of several neuropeptide hormones that acquire amyloid properties before their synaptic release. The latter places the interaction between SST and AÎ² among an increasing number of observations that attest to the ability of amyloidogenic proteins to influence each other. A model is presented which attempts to reconcile existing data on the involvement of SST in the AD etiology.,United States,Prion,29192843,2017,Somatostatin in Alzheimer'S disease: A new Role for an Old Player.,y
447,"INTRODUCTION
Hepatotoxicity is a major complication of acetaminophen (APAP), a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug. Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring diphenol and it has anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.


OBJECTIVES
In this study, the beneficial effects of RSV on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity was investigated in rats.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Group 1: Ethanol, Group 2: Saline, Group 3: RSV (10Â mg/kg/ip), Group 4: APAP (1000Â mg/kg/ip/single dose), Group 5: APAP+RSV (20Â min after administration of APAP). The rats were sacrificed 24Â h after administration of APAP. Light and electron microscopic changes were evaluated. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in liver tissue.


RESULTS
Rats of the ethanol, saline, and RSV groups did not present any histopathological alterations. In the APAP group, we observed vascular congestion, necrosis, inflammation, sinusoidal dilatation, and loss of glycogen content. In the APAP+RSV group, these changes were markedly reduced. iNOS immunostaining showed very weak positive stained hepatocytes the sections of control, saline, and RSV groups. However, in the APAP group, iNOS immunostaining was most evident in pericentral hepatocytes. In the same areas in APAP+RSV group, intensity of iNOS immunostaining decreased. A significant increase in MDA and decreases in GSH level, CAT, and SOD activity indicated that APAP-induced hepatotoxicity was mediated through oxidative stress. Significant beneficial changes were noted in tissue oxidative stress indicators in rats treated with RSV.


CONCLUSION
These biochemical, histopathological, and ultrastructural findings revealed that RSV reduced the severity of APAP-induced alterations in liver.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192844,2017,Resveratrol reduces light and electron microscopic changes in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in rats: Role of iNOS expression.,n
448,"The ultrastructural characteristics of apoptosis have been described microscopically for four decades. Alterations of nuclei, apoptotic bodies, cytoplasm, and some organelles have been illustrated and investigated during apoptosis. The successive changes of cellular components corresponding with differentiation of apoptotic cells are illustrated in the present review, based on ultrastructural observation of leukemia cells of patients in our routine clinic work by transmission electron microscopy. Most electron micrographs demonstrated that membranous components of nuclear envelop, rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria were degenerated step by step during apoptosis. The successive images suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus were transferred to cell surface from cytoplasm and participated in formation of apoptotic bodies in apoptosis, although relevant clinical data and more experimental evidence were needed for restraining of leukemia cases from diagnostic work randomly in recent decades.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192845,2017,Systematic alteration of apoptosis: a review with ultrastructural observations on leukemia cells in vivo.,n
449,"Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with health benefits in children, improving cardiac morphology, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and biological outcomes. This study aimed to examine the substitution effects of displaying a fixed duration of sedentary time with a fixed duration of physical activity (PA) at different intensities on children's CRF. A total of 315 children (136 boys) were assessed (age: 10.6Â Â±Â 0.6Â years old). Outcomes at baseline and follow-up (16-months) were CRF determined using a maximal cycle test and sedentary time and PA measured with accelerometers. Data were analysed by isotemporal substitution analyses estimating the effect of reallocating 30Â min/day of sedentary time by light (LPA), moderate (MPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) on CRF. VPA was positively and significantly associated with CRF cross-sectional (Î²Â =Â 0.026, pÂ <Â 0.001) and prospectively (Î²Â =Â 0.010, pÂ <Â 0.001). Reallocating 30Â min/day of sedentary time into VPA was positively cross-sectionally (Î²Â =Â 0.780, pÂ <Â 0.001) and prospectively (Î²Â =Â 0.303, pÂ <Â 0.05) associated with CRF. Conversely, relocating 30-minutes of sedentary time into 30Â minutes of LPA and MPA was not associated with CRF. These results suggest that reallocating an equal amount of time from sedentary into VPA is cross-sectional and prospectively associated with a favourable CRF.",England,Journal of sports sciences,29192846,2017,A cross-sectional and prospective analyse of reallocating sedentary time to physical activity on children's cardiorespiratory fitness.,n
450,"The aim of this study was to define the acid-etching technique for bone samples embedded in polymethyl metacrylate (PMMA) in order to visualize the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Human jaw bone tissue samples (NÂ =Â 18) were collected from the study population consisting of patients having received dental implant surgery. After collection, the bone samples were fixed in 70% ethanol and non-decalcified samples embedded routinely into polymethyl metacrylate (PMMA). The PMMA embedded specimens were acid-etched in either 9 or 37% phosphoric acid (PA) and prepared for SEM for further analysis. PMMA embedded bone specimens acid-etched by 9% PA concentration accomplishes the most informative and favorable visualization of the LCN to be observed by SEM. Etching of PMMA embedded specimens is recommendable to start with 30Â s or 40Â s etching duration in order to find the proper etching duration for the samples examined. Visualizing osteocytes and LCN provides a tool to study bone structure that reflects changes in bone metabolism and diseases related to bone tissue. By proper etching protocol of non-decalcified and using scanning electron microscope it is possible to visualize the morphology of osteocytes and the network supporting vitality of bone tissue.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192847,2017,Acid-etching technique of non-decalcified bone samples for visualizing osteocyte-lacuno-canalicular network using scanning electron microscope.,n
451,"This study investigated whether a high-fructose (HFr) diet changes the morphology of seminiferous tubules (ST) in rats and resveratrol (RES) has a possible restoring effect in this sense. Fructose (30%; w/v) was administered to rats alone or together with RES (50Â mg/L) in drinking water for 8Â weeks. In the HFr group, destruction of the germinal epithelium led to the detection of immature germ cells in the lumen. HFr diet gave rise to a decrease in the ST diameters (pÂ <Â 0.05), Johnsen's tubular biopsy score values (pÂ <Â 0.001), and an increase in the apoptotic index (pÂ <Â 0.05). Ultrastructurally, HFr feeding increased lipid accumulation (pÂ <Â 0.01), mitochondrial damage, and acrosomal abnormalities in spermatogenic cells. Treatment of HFr -fed rats with RES improved the reduced ST diameters and overall general histological and ultrastructural abnormalities of the STs, but did not change the increased apoptotic index.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192848,2017,Effects of resveratrol on high-fructose-induced testis injury in rats.,n
456,"In biomedical research, it is imperative to differentiate chance variation from truth before we generalize what we see in a sample of subjects to the wider population. For decades, we have relied on null hypothesis significance testing, where we calculate P values for our data to decide whether to reject a null hypothesis. This methodology is subject to substantial misinterpretation and errant conclusions. Instead of working backward by calculating the probability of our data if the null hypothesis were true, Bayesian statistics allow us instead to work forward, calculating the probability of our hypothesis given the available data. This methodology gives us a mathematical means of incorporating our ""prior probabilities"" from previous study data (if any) to produce new ""posterior probabilities.""

458,"OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes demyelination and axonal loss. Walking difficulties are a common and debilitating symptom of MS; they are usually caused by spastic paresis of the lower extremities. Although intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy has been reported to be an effective treatment for spasticity in MS, there is limited published evidence regarding its effects on ambulation. The goal of this study was to characterize ITB therapy outcomes in ambulatory patients with MS. METHODS Data from 47 ambulatory patients with MS who received ITB therapy were analyzed retrospectively. Outcome measures included Modified Ashworth Scale, Spasm Frequency Scale, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and the Timed 25-Foot Walk. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for changes in outcome measures between baseline and posttreatment (6 months and 1 year). Significance was set at p < 0.05. Descriptive data are expressed as the mean Â± SD, and results of the repeated-measures ANOVA tests and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test are expressed as the mean Â± SEM. RESULTS There was a statistically significant reduction in the following variables: 1) aggregate lower-extremity Modified Ashworth Scale scores (from 14.8 Â± 1.0 before ITB therapy to 5.8 Â± 0.8 at 6 months posttreatment and 6.4 Â± 0.9 at 1 year [p < 0.05]); 2) Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores (4.4 Â± 0.5 before ITB, 2.8 Â± 0.5 at 6 months, and 2.4 Â± 0.4 at 1 year [p < 0.05]); 3) spasm frequency (45.7% of the patients reported a spasm frequency of â‰¥ 1 event per hour before ITB therapy, whereas 15.6% and 4.3% of the patients reported the same at 6 months and 1 year posttreatment, respectively [p < 0.05]); and 4) the number of oral medications taken for spasticity (p < 0.05). Of the 47 patients, 34 remained ambulatory at 6 months, and 32 at 1 year posttreatment. There was no statistically significant change in performance on the Timed 25-Foot Walk test over time for those patients who remained ambulatory. CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective study, the authors found that ITB therapy is effective in reducing spasticity and related symptoms in ambulatory patients with MS. Because the use of ITB therapy is increasing in ambulatory patients with MS, randomized, prospective studies are important to help provide a more useful characterization of the effects of ITB therapy on ambulation.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery,29192855,2017,Early outcomes after intrathecal baclofen therapy in ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis.,n

460,"OBJECTIVE It is common for a medical disorder to be managed or researched by individuals who work within different specialties. It is known that both neurosurgeons and neurotologists manage vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients. While overlap in specialty focus has the potential to stimulate multidisciplinary collaboration and innovative thinking, there is a risk of specialties forming closed-communication loops, called knowledge silos, which may inhibit knowledge diffusion. This study quantitatively assessed knowledge sharing between neurosurgery and otolaryngology on the subject of VS. METHODS A broad Web of Science search was used to download details for 4439 articles related to VS through 2016. The publishing journal's specialty and the authors' specialties (based on author department) were determined for available articles. All 114,647 of the article references were categorized by journal specialty. The prevalence of several VS topics was assessed using keyword searches of titles. RESULTS For articles written by neurosurgeons, 44.0% of citations were from neurosurgery journal articles and 23.4% were from otolaryngology journals. The citations of otolaryngology authors included 11.6% neurosurgery journals and 56.5% otolaryngology journals. Both author specialty and journal specialty led to more citations of the same specialty, though author specialty had the largest effect. Comparing the specialties' literature, several VS topics had significantly different levels of coverage, including radiosurgery and hearing topics. Despite the availability of the Internet, there has been no change in the proportions of references for either specialty since 1997 (the year PubMed became publicly available). CONCLUSIONS Partial knowledge silos are observed between neurosurgery and otolaryngology on the topic of VS, based on the peer-reviewed literature. The increase in access provided by the Internet and searchable online databases has not decreased specialty reference bias.

461,"OBJECTIVE The head-up display (HUD) is a modern technology that projects images or numeric information directly into the observer's sight line. Surgeons will no longer need to look away from the surgical view using the HUD system to confirm the preoperative or navigation image. The present study investigated the usefulness of the HUD system for performing cerebral aneurysm clipping surgeries. METHODS Thirty-five patients underwent clipping surgery, including 20 keyhole surgeries for unruptured cerebral aneurysm, using the HUD system. Image information of structures such as the skull, cerebral vasculature, and aneurysm was integrated by the navigation software and linked with the positional coordinates of the microscope field of view. ""Image injection"" allowed visualization of the main structures that were concurrently tracked by the navigation image, and ""closed shutter"" switched the microscope field of view and the pointer image of the 3D brain image. RESULTS The HUD system was effective for estimating the location and 3D anatomy of the aneurysm before craniotomy or dural opening in most patients. Scheduled keyhole minicraniotomy and opening of the sylvian fissure or partial rectal gyrus resection were performed on the optimized location with a minimum size in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS The HUD images superimposed on the microscope field of view were remarkably useful for less invasive and more safe aneurysm clipping and, in particular, keyhole clipping.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery,29192858,2017,Head-up display may facilitate safe keyhole surgery for cerebral aneurysm clipping.,n
462,"OBJECTIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication. The risk of serious hemorrhagic complications when starting chemical prophylaxis for VTE prevention is a substantial concern for neurosurgeons. The objective of this study was to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to determine if the rates of VTE and bleeding complications are different in patients undergoing chemoprophylaxis compared with placebo or mechanical prophylaxis alone following cranial or spinal procedures. METHODS In February 2016 a systematic literature review was performed identifying 3944 articles from 4 different databases. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed after identifying the articles that met inclusion criteria. RESULTS Nine articles that met the inclusion criteria were included. The quality of the studies was good, with all of them being classified as Level 2 evidence, with moderate Jadad scores. A meta-analysis comparing chemoprophylaxis with placebo in the prevention of deep venous thrombosis showed a significant benefit to chemical prophylaxis (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.71; p < 0.0001). No significant increase in major intracranial hemorrhage (p = 0.60), major extracranial hemorrhage (p = 0.98), or minor bleeding complications (p = 0.60) was found. CONCLUSIONS Based on moderate-to-good quality of evidence, chemoprophylaxis is beneficial in preventing VTE, with no significant increase in either major or minor bleeding complications in patients undergoing cranial and spinal procedures.

463,"OBJECTIVE Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a commonly employed treatment modality for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, due to the low frequency of delayed cyst formation after AVM SRS, as well as the prolonged time interval between treatment and its occurrence, the characteristics of post-SRS cyst formation are not well defined. Therefore, the aims of this retrospective cohort study are to determine the rate of cyst formation after SRS for AVMs, identify predictive factors, and evaluate the clinical sequelae of post-SRS cysts. METHODS The authors analyzed an SRS database for AVM patients who underwent SRS at the University of Virginia and identified those who developed post-SRS cysts. Statistical analyses were performed to determine predictors of post-SRS cyst formation and the effect of cyst formation on new or worsening seizures after SRS. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 1159 AVM patients treated with SRS; cyst formation occurred in 17 patients (post-SRS cyst rate of 1.5%). Compared with patients who did not develop post-SRS cysts, those with cyst formation were treated with a greater number of radiosurgical isocenters (mean 3.8 vs 2.8, p = 0.047), had a longer follow-up (mean 132 vs 71 months, p < 0.001), were more likely to develop radiological radiation-induced changes (RIC) (64.7% vs 36.1%, p = 0.021), and had a longer duration of RIC (57 vs 21 months, p < 0.001). A higher number of isocenters (p = 0.014), radiological RIC (p = 0.002), and longer follow-up (p = 0.034) were found to be independent predictors of post-SRS cyst formation in the multivariate analysis. There was a trend toward a significant association between cyst formation and new or worsening seizures in univariate analysis (p = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS Patients with greater nidal complexity appear to be more prone to post-SRS cyst formation. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of long-term follow-up for patients who have undergone AVM SRS, even after nidal obliteration is achieved.

The mass was consistent with normal brain tissue (neurons and glial cells) without evidence of mitoses. A final histopathological diagnosis of ectopic brain tissue with neural tissue demonstrating focal, chronic T-cell inflammation was made.

465,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to define a set of clinicoradiological parameters with a high specificity for the diagnosis of intraneural perineurioma, obviating the need for operative tissue diagnosis. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed MR images obtained in a large cohort of patients who underwent targeted fascicular biopsy and included only those patients for whom the biopsy yielded a diagnosis. Clinical and radiological findings were then tested for their ability to predict a tissue diagnosis of intraneural perineurioma. The authors propose a new set of diagnostic criteria, referred to as the Perineurioma Diagnostic Criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of several clinicoradiological methods of diagnosis were compared. RESULTS A total of 195 patients who underwent targeted fascicular biopsy were included in the cohort, of whom 51 had a tissue diagnosis of intraneural perineurioma. When the clinicoradiological methods used in this study were compared, the highest sensitivity (0.86), negative predictive value (0.95), and F1 score (0.88) were observed for the decision trees generated in C5.0 and rPart, whereas the highest specificity (1.0) and positive predictive value (1.0) were observed for the Perineurioma Diagnostic Criteria. CONCLUSIONS This study identified clinical and radiological features that are associated with a diagnosis of perineurioma. The Perineurioma Diagnostic Criteria were determined to be the following: 1) no cancer history, 2) unifocal disease, 3) moderate to severe hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images, 4) moderate to severe contrast enhancement, 5) homogeneous contrast enhancement, 6) fusiform shape, 7) enlargement of the involved nerves, and 8) age â‰¤ 40 years.

466,"Precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid (PHIL) is a newly available liquid embolic agent for endovascular therapy. It is nonadhesive and composed of a biocompatible polymer dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent and bonded covalently with iodine. In this report, the authors present their preliminary experience using PHIL in the treatment of intracranial vascular shunts. Between July 2015 and December 2015, 11 patients underwent endovascular embolization using the PHIL embolic agent. Five patients had arteriovenous malformations, 4 had dural arteriovenous fistulas, 1 patient had a carotid-cavernous fistula, and 1 patient had a pial arteriovenous fistula. Clinical features, angioarchitectural characteristics, procedural details, and periprocedural complications were included in the analysis. Complete or near-complete obliteration of the nidus or fistulas was achieved in 8 of these patients. Partial embolization (approximately 80% in 2 and 30% in 1) was attained in the other 3 patients. Satisfactory venous penetration after nidal embolization was achieved in all patients. In 1 patient, the microcatheter could not be retrieved. No other major complications related to PHIL injection were noted during the procedure or periprocedural period. Clinical follow-up ranging from 8 months to 1 year showed good outcomes in all but 1 patient, who experienced an intraventricular hemorrhage 6 weeks after embolization. PHIL appears to be an effective alternative embolic material with certain advantages over other available liquid embolic agents.

468,"OBJECTIVE The acquisition and refinement of cognitive and behavioral skills during development is associated with the maturation of various brain oscillatory activities. Most developmental investigations have identified distinct patterns of low-frequency electrophysiological activity that are characteristic of various behavioral milestones. In this investigation, the authors focused on the cross-sectional developmental properties of high-frequency spectral power from the brain's default mode network (DMN) during goal-directed behavior. METHODS The authors contrasted regionally specific, time-evolving high gamma power (HGP) in the lateral DMN cortex between 3 young children (age range 3-6 years) and 3 adults by use of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings over the left perisylvian cortex during a picture-naming task. RESULTS Across all participants, a nearly identical and consistent response suppression of HGP, which is a functional signature of the DMN, was observed during task performance recordings acquired from ECoG electrodes placed over the lateral DMN cortex. This finding provides evidence of relatively early maturation of the DMN. Furthermore, only HGP relative to evoked alpha and beta band power showed this level of consistency across all participants. CONCLUSIONS Regionally specific, task-evoked suppression of the high-frequency components of the cortical power spectrum is established early in brain development, and this response may reflect the early maturation of specific cognitive and/or computational mechanisms.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

469,"OBJECTIVE The treatment of frontoethmoidal meningoencephaloceles (fMECs) in Cambodia was not possible before the development of a program that taught some Khmer surgeons (working at the Children's Surgical Centre in Phnom Penh) how to surgically correct these deformities without any foreign help. The results of that teaching program are discussed in this paper. METHODS Between 2004 and 2009, both local and visiting foreign neurosurgical and craniofacial surgeons (the visitors coming twice a year) worked together to operate on 200 patients, and a report on those cases was published in 2010. In subsequent years (2010-2016), the Khmer surgeons operated on 100 patients without the presence of the visiting surgeons. In this study, the authors compare the second case series with the previously published series and the literature in terms of results and complications. The operations were performed with limited surgical materials and equipment, using a combined bicoronal and transfacial approach in most cases. Most of the patients came from very poor families. RESULTS Organizing the postoperative follow-up of these low-income patients (mean age 12 years) was probably the most challenging part of this teaching program. Nine of the patients were lost to surgical follow-up. In the other cases, cosmetic results were judged by the surgeons as worse than the patient's preoperative appearance in 1 case, poor in 12 cases, average in 27, and good in 51-data that are significantly less encouraging than the results reported by the joint local/visiting teams in 2010 (p = 0.0001). Nevertheless, patients and parents tended to have a better overall opinion about the surgical results (rating the results as good in 84% of the 80 cases in which parent or patient ratings were available). Twenty postoperative complications were observed (the most common being temporary CSF leaks). The rate of immediate postoperative complications directly related to fMEC surgery was less than that in the previous series, but the difference was not statistically significant (20% vs 28.5%, p = 0.58). No death was noted in this case series (in contrast to the previous series). Social questionnaire results confirmed that fMEC correction partially improved the adverse social and educational consequences of fMEC in affected children. CONCLUSIONS In the current state of this program, the local surgeons are able to correct fMECs in their own country, without foreign assistance, with good results in a majority of patients.

470,"OBJECTIVE Severe traumatic brain injury remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. Providers focus on reducing secondary brain injury by avoiding hypoxemia, avoiding hypotension, providing normoventilation, treating intracranial hypertension, and reducing cerebral metabolic demand. Hyperthermia is frequently present in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, contributes to cerebral metabolic demand, and is associated with prolonged hospital admission as well as impaired neurological outcome. The objective of this quality improvement initiative was to reduce the duration of hyperthermia for pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury during the initial 72 hours of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the incidence and duration of hyperthermia within a preintervention cohort. The retrospective phase was followed by three 6-month intervention periods (intervention Phase 1, the maintenance phase, and intervention Phase 2). Intervention Phase 1 entailed placement of a cooling blanket on the bed prior to patient arrival and turning it on once the patient's temperature rose above normothermia. The maintenance phase focused on sustaining the results of Phase 1. Intervention Phase 2 focused on total prevention of hyperthermia by initiating cooling blanket use immediately upon patient arrival to the intensive care unit. RESULTS The median hyperthermia duration in the preintervention cohort (n = 47) was 135 minutes. This was reduced in the Phase 1 cohort (n = 9) to 45 minutes, increased in the maintenance phase cohort (n = 6) to 88.5 minutes, and decreased again in the Phase 2 cohort (n = 9) to a median value of 0 minutes. Eight percent of patients in the intervention cohorts required additional sedation to tolerate the cooling blanket. Eight percent of patients in the intervention cohorts became briefly hypothermic while on the cooling blanket. No patient required neuromuscular blockade to tolerate the cooling blanket, experienced an arrhythmia, had new coagulopathy, or developed a pressure ulcer. CONCLUSIONS The placement of a cooling blanket on the bed prior to patient arrival and actively targeting normothermia successfully reduced the incidence and duration of hyperthermia with minimal adverse events.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

472,"OBJECTIVE Oligodendroglioma is a rare primary CNS neoplasm in the pediatric population, and only a limited number of studies in the literature have characterized this entity. Existing studies are limited by small sample sizes and discrepant interstudy findings in identified prognostic factors. In the present study, the authors aimed to increase the statistical power in evaluating for potential prognostic factors of pediatric oligodendrogliomas and sought to reconcile the discrepant findings present among existing studies by performing an individual-patient-data (IPD) meta-analysis and using multiple imputation to address data not directly available from existing studies. METHODS A systematic search was performed, and all studies found to be related to pediatric oligodendrogliomas and associated outcomes were screened for inclusion. Each study was searched for specific demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient and the duration of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Given that certain demographic and clinical information of each patient was not available within all studies, a multivariable imputation via chained equations model was used to impute missing data after the mechanism of missing data was determined. The primary end points of interest were hazard ratios for EFS and OS, as calculated by the Cox proportional-hazards model. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The multivariate model was adjusted for age, sex, tumor grade, mixed pathologies, extent of resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, tumor location, and initial presentation. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A systematic search identified 24 studies with both time-to-event and IPD characteristics available, and a total of 237 individual cases were available for analysis. A median of 19.4% of the values among clinical, demographic, and outcome variables in the compiled 237 cases were missing. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed subtotal resection (p = 0.007 [EFS] and 0.043 [OS]), initial presentation of headache (p = 0.006 [EFS] and 0.004 [OS]), mixed pathologies (p = 0.005 [EFS] and 0.049 [OS]), and location of the tumor in the parietal lobe (p = 0.044 [EFS] and 0.030 [OS]) to be significant predictors of tumor progression or recurrence and death. CONCLUSIONS The use of IPD meta-analysis provides a valuable means for increasing statistical power in investigations of disease entities with a very low incidence. Missing data are common in research, and multiple imputation is a flexible and valid approach for addressing this issue, when it is used conscientiously. Undergoing subtotal resection, having a parietal tumor, having tumors with mixed pathologies, and suffering headaches at the time of diagnosis portended a poorer prognosis in pediatric patients with oligodendroglioma.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

We compared the heterogeneity of handwritten texts in tasks with different cognitive demands; the heterogeneity of texts was analyzed with lacunarity, a measure of geometrical invariance. In Experiment 1, we asked participants to perform two tasks that varied in cognitive demands: transcription and exposition about an autobiographical episode. Lacunarity was significantly lower in transcription. In Experiment 2, we compared a veridical and a fictitious version of a personal event. Lacunarity was lower in veridical texts.

The authors investigate the skills tapped by drawing and the risk factors associated with poor drawing. Self-portraits of 345 preschool children were scored by raters trained in using the Draw-a-Person Intellectual Ability test (DAP:IQ) rubric (C. R. Reynolds & J. A. Hickman, 2004). Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192871,2017,What Does the DAP:IQ Measure?: Drawing Comparisons between Drawing Performance and Developmental Assessments.,y

476,"Background Information on ethnic disparities in stroke between White and Pakistani population in Europe is scarce. Bradford District has the largest proportion of Pakistani people in England; this provides a unique opportunity to study the difference in stroke between the two major ethnic groups. Aim To determine the first-ever-stroke incidence and examine the disparities in stroke patterns between Whites and Pakistanis in Bradford. Methods Prospective 12 months study consisting of 273,327 adults (â‰¥18 years) residents. Stroke cases were identified by multiple overlapping approaches. Results In the study period, 541 first-ever-strokes were recorded. The crude incidence rate was 198 per 100,000 person-years. Age adjusted-standardized rate to the World Health Organization world population of first-ever-stroke is 155 and 101 per 100,000 person-years in Pakistanis and Whites respectively. Four hundred and thirty-eight patients (81%) were Whites, 83 (15.3%) were Pakistanis, 11 (2%) were Indian and Bangladeshis, and 9 (1.7%) were of other ethnic origin. Pakistanis were significantly younger and had more obesity ( pâ€‰=â€‰0.049), and diabetes mellitus (DM) ( pâ€‰=â€‰<0.001). They were less likely to suffer from atrial fibrillation ( pâ€‰=â€‰<0.001), be ex- or current smokers ( pâ€‰=â€‰<0.001), and drink alcohol above the recommended level ( pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) compared with Whites. In comparison with Whites, higher rates of age-adjusted stroke (1.5-fold), lacunar infarction (threefold), and ischemic infarction due to large artery disease (twofold) were found in the Pakistanis.

Results revealed that the 5- to 8-year-old children were able to discriminate between antisocial and prosocial teases. Although the children's parents or legal guardians indicated that the children had more frequent experience with prosocial than antisocial teases in the home, (a) the children were better able to correctly identify the intent of antisocial teasers than prosocial teasers and (b) the parents or legal guardians (correctly) indicated that their child would be better able to recognize an antisocial tease than a prosocial tease. Despite the finding that the children's comprehension of antisocial teasing tended to exceed their comprehension of prosocial teasing, the findings indicate that being relatively young (i.e., 5-6Â years old vs. 7-8Â years old) and having relatively frequent experience with antisocial teasing in the home may be associated with some children's difficulty in recognizing the intent behind antisocial teases.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192874,2017,Young Children's ability to Discriminate between Antisocial and Prosocial Teases.,y
478,"OBJECTIVE The authors report a novel paradigm for resection of the disc or dural complex to treat giant calcified transdural herniated thoracic discs, and they describe a technique for the repair of dural defects. These herniated thoracic discs are uncommon, complicated lesions that often require a multidisciplinary team for effective treatment. The intradural component must be removed to effectively decompress the spinal cord. The opening of the friable dura mater, which frequently adheres to the extradural component of the disc, can result in large defects and difficult-to-manage CSF leaks. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective study of the technique and outcomes in patients with a transdural herniated disc treated at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center within a 4-year period between 2012 and 2015. RESULTS During the study period, 7 patients (mean age 56.1 years) presented to the department of neurosurgery with clinical symptoms consistent with myeloradiculopathy. In all cases, 2-level corpectomies of the involved levels were combined with circumferential resection of the dura and complete decompression of the spinal cord. The dural defect was repaired with an onlay dural patch, and a large piece of AlloDerm (LifeCell Corp) graft was sewn to close the pleural defect. Every patient had a perioperative lumbar drain placed for CSF diversion. No patient suffered neurological decline related to the surgery, and 3 patients experienced clinically significant improvement in function. Two patients developed an early postoperative CSF leak that required operative revision to oversew the defects. CONCLUSIONS This novel technique for decompression of the spinal cord by dural resection for the removal of giant calcified transdural herniated thoracic discs is safe and results in excellent decompression of the spinal cord. The technique becomes necessary when primary repair of the dura is not possible, and it can be used in cases in which the resection of pathology includes the dura.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

479,"OBJECTIVE The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the vertebral artery (VA) often exhibit anatomical variations at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ). An example of this is the PICA originating extradurally from the V3 segment of the VA. To date, some cadaveric investigations have been reported, but the incidence and relationship of this variation to the VA and the atlas as observed on clinical imaging have not been discussed. This study evaluated the prevalence of PICAs originating from the V3 on CT scanning. Other variations of the atlas and VA were also analyzed. METHODS CT images from a series of 153 patients who underwent 3D CT angiography (CTA) were analyzed, and variations of the PICA, VA, and atlas were investigated. RESULTS A total of 142 patients (284 sides) were analyzed; 11 patients (7.2%) were excluded due to poor image quality. The most common VA variation was the PICA originating from V3 (9.5% of 284 sides), which was more frequently observed on the nondominant VA than the dominant VA (22.5% vs 6.25%, p = 0.0005). A VA with a PICA end was identified in 4 sides (1.4%), which is the same incidence as observed in the persistent first intersegmental VA (1.4%). VA fenestration was only found in 1 side (0.35%). Regarding the atlas, ponticulus posticus was observed in 24 sides (8.5%). There was no relationship between the incidence of ponticulus posticus and the variations of the VA. CONCLUSIONS A PICA originating from V3 was the most common VA variation at the CVJ and was more common on the nondominant VA. Three-dimensional CTA is useful for the evaluation of this variance.

480,"OBJECTIVE Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, more patients with a high body mass index (BMI) will require surgical treatment for degenerative spinal disease. In previous investigations of lumbar spine pathology, obesity has been associated with worsened postoperative outcomes and increased costs. However, few studies have examined the association between BMI and postoperative outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes, postoperative narcotics consumption, complications, and hospital costs among BMI stratifications for patients who have undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF procedures. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained surgical database of patients who had undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spinal pathology between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified by BMI as follows: normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), or obese II-III (â‰¥ 35.0 kg/m2). Differences in patient demographics and preoperative characteristics were compared across the BMI cohorts using 1-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Multivariate linear or Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine the presence of an association between BMI category and narcotics utilization, improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores, incidence of complications, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, and hospital costs. Regression analyses were controlled for preoperative demographic and procedural characteristics. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients were included in the analysis, of whom 20.9% (n = 58) were normal weight, 37.5% (n = 104) were overweight, 24.9% (n = 69) were obese I, and 16.6% (n = 46) were obese II-III. A higher BMI was associated with an older age (p = 0.049) and increased comorbidity burden (p = 0.001). No differences in sex, smoking status, insurance type, diagnosis, presence of neuropathy, or preoperative VAS pain scores were found among the BMI cohorts (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found among these cohorts as regards operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and number of operative levels (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in postoperative narcotics consumption, VAS score improvement, complication rates, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, or total direct costs existed across BMI stratifications (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher BMI demonstrated surgical outcomes, narcotics consumption, and hospital costs comparable to those of patients with a lower BMI. Thus, ACDF procedures are both safe and effective for all patients across the entire BMI spectrum. Patients should be counseled to expect similar rates of postoperative complications and eventual clinical improvement regardless of their BMI.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

The C-1 (atlas) fracture was widely displaced anteriorly, but the transverse ligament was intact. In an effort to enable a return to play and avoid intersegmental (C1-2) fusion, the patient underwent a transoral approach for open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture. The associated posterior ring fracture displacement widened after this procedure, and a subsequent posterior arthrodesis and fixation of the fracture site was performed 6 months later when the fracture failed to heal with rigid collar immobilization. The approach maintained the normal range of motion at the atlantoaxial and atlantooccipital joints, which would have been sacrificed by an atlantoaxial or occipitocervical fusion, as is traditionally performed. Ultimately, the patient decided not to return to the football field, but this approach could avoid the more significant loss of motion associated with atlantoaxial or occipitocervical fusion for unstable Jefferson fractures.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

482,"OBJECTIVE A previous study found that ultra-low radiation imaging (ULRI) with image enhancement significantly decreases radiation exposure by roughly 75% for both the patient and operating room personnel during minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) (p < 0.001). However, no clinical data exist on whether this imaging modality negatively impacts patient outcomes. Thus, the goal of this randomized controlled trial was to assess pedicle screw placement accuracy with ULRI with image enhancement compared with conventional, standard-dose fluoroscopy for patients undergoing single-level MIS-TLIF. METHODS An institutional review board-approved, prospective internally randomized controlled trial was performed to compare breach rates for pedicle screw placement performed using ULRI with image enhancement versus conventional fluoroscopy. For cannulation and pedicle screw placement, surgery on 1 side (left vs right) was randomly assigned to be performed under ULRI. Screws on the opposite side were placed under conventional fluoroscopy, thereby allowing each patient to serve as his/her own control. In addition to standard intraoperative images to check screw placement, each patient underwent postoperative CT. Three experienced neurosurgeons independently analyzed the images and were blinded as to which imaging modality was used to assist with each screw placement. Screw placement was analyzed for pedicle breach (lateral vs medial and Grade 0 [< 2.0 mm], Grade 1 [2.0-4.0 mm], or Grade 2 [> 4.0 mm]), appropriate screw depth (50%-75% of the vertebral body's anteroposterior dimension), and appropriate screw angle (within 10Â° of the pedicle angle). The effective breach rate was calculated as the percentage of screws evaluated as breached > 2.0 mm medially or postoperatively symptomatic. RESULTS Twenty-three consecutive patients underwent single-level MIS-TLIF, and their sides were randomly assigned to receive ULRI. No patient had immediate postoperative complications (e.g., neurological decline, need for hardware repositioning). On CT confirmation, 4 screws that had K-wire placement and cannulation under ULRI and screw placement under conventional fluoroscopy showed deviations. There were 2 breaches that deviated medially but both were Grade 0 (< 2.0 mm). Similarly, 2 breaches occurred that were Grade 1 (> 2.0 mm) but both deviated laterally. Therefore, the effective breach rate (breach > 2.0 mm deviated medially) was unchanged in both imaging groups (0% using either ULRI or conventional fluoroscopy; p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS ULRI with image enhancement does not compromise accuracy during pedicle screw placement compared with conventional fluoroscopy while it significantly decreases radiation exposure to both the patient and operating room personnel.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

The 3 patients who developed a postoperative epidural hematoma became symptomatic 2-17 days after the initial operation. All 3 patients underwent at least 1 hematoma evacuation and wound closure over suction drains prior to recurrence with severe neurological deficit and definitive management with NPDT. One patient was managed primarily with NPDT for uncontrollable intraoperative hemorrhage during posterior cervical laminectomy. All 4 patients had significant risk factors for postoperative epidural hematoma. NPDT for 3-9 days with delayed wound closure was successful in all patients. The 3 patients with recurrent symptomatic postoperative epidural hematoma had significant improvement in their severe neurological deficit.

488,"Computed tomography (CT) image recovery from low-mAs acquisitions without adequate treatment is always severely degraded due to a number of physical factors. In this paper, we formulate the low-dose CT sinogram preprocessing as a standard maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, which takes full consideration of the statistical properties of the two intrinsic noise sources in low-dose CT, i.e., the X-ray photon statistics and the electronic noise background. In addition, instead of using a general image prior as found in the traditional sinogram recovery models, we design a new prior formulation to more rationally encode the piecewise-linear configurations underlying a sinogram than previously used ones, like the TV prior term. As compared with the previous methods, especially the MAP-based ones, both the likelihood/loss and prior/regularization terms in the proposed model are ameliorated in a more accurate manner and better comply with the statistical essence of the generation mechanism of a practical sinogram. We further construct an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve the proposed MAP framework.

489,"Repeated CT scans are known to increase the risk of cancer; thus, it is paradoxical to use multiple follow-up CT scans to monitor the development of a lung nodule and conduct early treatment of the nodule. In the case of a solitary lung nodule, regional scanning and region of interest (ROI) reconstruction are likely to restore the internal area at the nodule. A limited-range few-view CT is proposed in this paper for lung nodule follow-ups with extremely reduced X-radiation. For a planned scanning of an ROI, where a solitary lung nodule is positioned, a limited-range few-view CT can be employed, and thus, less tissue is exposed to X-radiation per view. An ROI reconstruction method is also proposed that makes full use of the former standard lung scan. The experimental results show that the nodule size and shape are preserved. In the case of a 40-mm ROI, the number of exposed X-rays can be reduced by 99.6% for a circular scan and 99.9% for a 3-D scan.",United States,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,29192886,2017,Limited-Range Few-View CT: Using Historical Images for ROI Reconstruction in Solitary Lung Nodules Follow-up Examination.,n
490,"A single-scan dual-energy low-dose cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging technique that exploits a multi-slit filter is proposed in this paper. The multi-slit filter installed between the x-ray source and the scanned object is reciprocated during a scan. The x-ray beams through the slits would generate relatively low-energy x-ray projection data, while the filtered beams would make high-energy projection data. An iterative image reconstruction algorithm that uses an adaptive-steepest-descent method to minimize image total-variation under the constraint of data fidelity was applied to reconstructing the image from the low-energy projection data. Since the high-energy projection data suffer from a substantially high noise level due to the beam filtration, we have developed a new algorithm that exploits the joint sparsity between the low- and high-energy CT images for image reconstruction of the high-energy CT image. The proposed image reconstruction algorithm uses a gradient magnitude image (GMI) of the low-energy CT image by regularizing the difference of GMIs of the low- and high-energy CT images to be minimized. The feasibility of the proposed technique has been demonstrated by the use of various phantoms in the experimental CBCT setup. Furthermore, based on the proposed dual-energy imaging, a material differentiation was performed and its potential utility has been shown.

491,"Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been widely used in radiation therapy. For accurate patient setup and treatment target localization, it is important to obtain high-quality reconstruction images. The total variation (TV) penalty has shown the state-of-the-art performance in suppressing noise and preserving edges for statistical iterative image reconstruction, but it sometimes leads to the so-called staircase effect. In this paper, we proposed to use a new family of penalties-the Hessian Schatten (HS) penalties-for the CBCT reconstruction. Consisting of the second-order derivatives, the HS penalties are able to reflect the smooth intensity transitions of the underlying image without introducing the staircase effect. We discussed and compared the behaviors of several convex HS penalties with orders 1, 2, and for CBCT reconstruction. We used the majorization-minimization approach with a primal-dual formulation for the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on two digital phantoms and two physical phantoms demonstrated the proposed penalty family's outstanding performance over TV in suppressing the staircase effect, and the HS penalty with order 1 had the best performance among the HS penalties tested.",United States,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,29192888,2017,Low-Dose CBCT Reconstruction Using Hessian Schatten Penalties.,n
492,"A stochastic noise-driven dynamic model is proposed to study the diffusion of water molecules around the protein &#13; surface, under the effect of thermal fluctuations that arises due to the collisions of water molecules with the &#13; surrounding environment. The underlying dynamics of such a system may be described in the framework of generalized &#13; Langevin equation, where the thermal fluctuations are assumed to be algebraically correlated in time, which&#13; governs the non-Markovian behavior of the system. Results of the mean-square displacement and velocity autocorrelation &#13; function calculations reveal that the hydration water around the protein surface follow a subdiffusive dynamics &#13; at long times. Analytical expressions for the first passage time distribution, survival probability, &#13; mean residence time and mean first passage time of water molecules are derived for different &#13; boundary conditions, to analyze the hydration water dynamics under the effect of thermally correlated noise. The &#13; results depict a unimodal distribution of the first passage time unlike Brownian motion. &#13; Survival probability of hydration water follows a stretched exponential decay for both boundary conditions. &#13; The mean residence time of the hydration water molecule for different initial positions increases with the increase &#13; in the complexity/heterogeneity of the surrounding environment for both boundary conditions. &#13; The mean first passage time of the water molecule to reach the absorbing/reflecting boundary follows an asymptotic &#13; power law with respect to the thickness of the hydration layer and increases with the increase in the &#13; complexity/heterogeneity of the environment.",England,Journal of physics.

494,"The aim of the study was to examine the pros and cons of different types of functional EIT (fEIT) to quantify tidal ventilation distribution in a clinical setting. &#13; Approach: fEIT images were calculated with (1) standard deviation of pixel time curve, (2) regression coefficients of global and local impedance time curves, or (3) mean tidal variations. To characterize temporal heterogeneity of tidal ventilation distribution, another fEIT image of pixel inspiration times is also proposed. &#13; Main results: fEIT - regression is very robust to signals with different phase information. When the respiratory signal should be distinguished from the heart-beat related signal, or during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, fEIT - regression is superior to other types. fEIT - tidal variation is the most stable image type regarding the baseline shift. We recommend using this type of fEIT image for preliminary evaluation of the acquired EIT data. However, all these fEITs would be misleading in their assessment of ventilation distribution in the presence of temporal heterogeneity. &#13; Significance: The analysis software provided by the currently available commercial EIT equipment only offers either fEIT of standard deviation or tidal variation.

Using classical and quantum mechanical calculations, we have investigated the electronic and thermoelectric properties of the atomically thin superlattice of C3Si3/C (C3Ge3/C) formed by the incorporation of Si (Ge) atoms into graphene. The bandgap and phonon thermal conductivity of C3Si3/C (C3Ge3/C) are 0.54 (0.51) eV and 15.48 (12.64) Wm-1K-1, respectively, while the carrier mobility of C3Si3/C (C3Ge3/C) is 1.285 x 105 (1.311 x 105) cm2V-1s-1 at 300 K.

496,"Understanding the interfacial properties of catalyst/substrate is crucial for the design of high-performance catalyst for important chemical reactions. Recent years have witnessed a surge of research in utilizing MoS2 as a promising electro-catalyst for hydrogen production, and field effect has been employed to enhance the activity (Adv. Mater. 2017, 29, 1604464; Nano Lett. 2017, 17, 4109). However, the underlying atomic mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, by using the prototype MoS2/Au system as a probe, we investigate effects of external electric field on the interfacial electronic structures via density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that although there is no covalent interaction between MoS2 overlayer and Au substrate, an applied electric field efficiently adjusts the charge transfer between MoS2 and Au, leading to tunable Schottky barrier type (n-type to p-type) and decrease of barrier height to facilitate charge injection. Furthermore, we predict that the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen on MoS2/Au to be readily controlled by electric field to a broad range within a modest magnitude of field, which may benefit the performance enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction. Our DFT results provide valuable insight into the experimental observations and pave the way for future understanding and control of catalysts in practice, such as those with vacancies, defects, edge states or synthesized nanostructures.",England,Nanotechnology,29192893,2017,Electric field tuned MoS<sub>2</sub>/metal interface for hydrogen evolution catalyst from first-principles investigations.,n
497,"The research interest in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is ever growing due to its potential to contribute towards clean and portable energy. However, the lack of low energy band gap materials with high photocorrosion resistance is the primary setback inhibiting this technology from commercialisation. The ternary alloy InGaN shows promise to meet the photoelectrode material requirements due to its high chemical stability and band gap tunability. The band gap of InGaN can be modulated from the UV to IR regions by adjusting the In concentration so as to absorb the maximum portion of the solar spectrum. This paper reports on the influence of In concentration on the PEC properties of planar and nanopillar (NP) InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well (MQW) photoanodes, where NPs were fabricated using a top-down approach. Results show that changing the In concentration, while having a minor effect on the PEC performance of planar MQWs, has an enormous impact on the PEC performance of NP MQWs, with large variations in the photocurrent density observed. Planar photoanodes containing MQWs generate marginally lower photocurrents compared to photoanodes without MQWs when illuminated with sunlight. NP MQWs with 30% In generated the highest photocurrent density of 1.6 mA/cm2, 4 times greater than that of its planar counterpart and 1.8 times greater than that of the NP photoanode with no MQWs. The InGaN/GaN MQWs also slightly influenced the onset potential of both the planar and NP photoanodes.

505,"In response to varying stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor is able to promote repair, survival, or elimination of damaged cells - processes that have great relevance to organismal aging. Although the link between p53 and cancer is well established, the contribution of p53 to the aging process is less clear. Delineating how p53 regulates distinct aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered metabolic pathways will be critical. Mouse models have further revealed the centrality and complexity of the p53 network in aging processes. While naturally aged mice have linked longevity with declining p53 function, some accelerated aging mice present with chronic p53 activation, whose phenotypes can be rescued upon p53 deficiency. Further, direct modulation of the p53-MDM2 axis has correlated elevated p53 activity with either early aging or with delayed-onset aging. We speculate that p53-mediated aging phenotypes in these mice must have (1) stably active p53 due to MDM2 dysregulation or chronic stress or (2) shifted p53 outcomes. Pinpointing which p53 stressors, modifications, and outcomes drive aging processes will provide further insights into our understanding of the human aging process and could have implications for both cancer and aging therapeutics.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cdd.2017.187.",England,Cell death and differentiation,29192902,2017,Relevance of the p53-MDM2 axis to aging.,y
506,"The association between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) is the key to the success of reef ecosystems in highly oligotrophic environments, but it is also their Achilles' heel due to its vulnerability to local stressors and the effects of climate change. Research during the last two decades has shaped a view that coral host-Symbiodinium pairings are diverse, but largely exclusive. Deep sequencing has now revealed the existence of a rare diversity of cryptic Symbiodinium assemblages within the coral holobiont, in addition to one or a few abundant algal members. While the contribution of the most abundant resident Symbiodinium species to coral physiology is widely recognized, the significance of the rare and low abundant background Symbiodinium remains a matter of debate. In this study, we assessed how coral-Symbiodinium communities assemble and how rare and abundant components together constitute the Symbiodinium community by analyzing 892 coral samples comprising >110â€‰000 unique Symbiodinium ITS2 marker gene sequences. Using network modeling, we show that host-Symbiodinium communities assemble in non-random 'clusters' of abundant and rare symbionts. Symbiodinium community structure follows the same principles as bacterial communities, for which the functional significance of rare members (the 'rare bacterial biosphere') has long been recognized. Importantly, the inclusion of rare Symbiodinium taxa in robustness analyses revealed a significant contribution to the stability of the host-symbiont community overall. As such, it highlights the potential functions rare symbionts may provide to environmental resilience of the coral holobiont.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.151.",England,The ISME journal,29192903,2017,Rare symbionts may contribute to the resilience of coral-algal assemblages.,n
507,"The diet provides carbohydrates that are non-digestible in the upper gut and are major carbon and energy sources for the microbial community in the lower intestine, supporting a complex metabolic network. Fermentation produces the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate and butyrate, which have health-promoting effects for the human host. Here we investigated microbial community changes and SCFA production during in vitro batch incubations of 15 different non-digestible carbohydrates, at two initial pH values with faecal microbiota from three different human donors. To investigate temporal stability and reproducibility, a further experiment was performed 1 year later with four of the carbohydrates. The lower pH (5.5) led to higher butyrate and the higher pH (6.5) to more propionate production. The strongest propionigenic effect was found with rhamnose, followed by galactomannans, whereas fructans and several Î±- and Î²-glucans led to higher butyrate production. 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based quantitative PCR analysis of 22 different microbial groups together with 454 sequencing revealed significant stimulation of specific bacteria in response to particular carbohydrates. Some changes were ascribed to metabolite cross-feeding, for example, utilisation by Eubacterium hallii of 1,2-propanediol produced from fermentation of rhamnose by Blautia spp. Despite marked inter-individual differences in microbiota composition, SCFA production was surprisingly reproducible for different carbohydrates, indicating a level of functional redundancy. Interestingly, butyrate formation was influenced not only by the overall % butyrate-producing bacteria in the community but also by the initial pH, consistent with a pH-dependent shift in the stoichiometry of butyrate production.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/ismej.2017.196.",England,The ISME journal,29192904,2017,Specific substrate-driven changes in human faecal microbiota composition contrast with functional redundancy in short-chain fatty acid production.,n
508,"Globally, marine surface sediments constitute a habitat for estimated 1.7 Ã— 1028 prokaryotes. For benthic microbial community analysis, usually, several grams of sediment are processed. In this study, we made the step from bulk sediments to single sand grains to address the microbial community directly in its micro-habitat: the individual bacterial diversity on 17 sand grains was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and visualized on sand grains using catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. In all, 104-105 cells were present on grains from 202 to 635â€‰Î¼m diameter. Colonization was patchy, with exposed areas largely devoid of any epi-growth (mean cell-cell distance 4.5Â±5.9â€‰Î¼m) and protected areas more densely populated (0.5Â±0.7â€‰Î¼m). Mean cell-cell distances were 100-fold shorter compared with the water column. In general, growth occurred in monolayers. Each sand grain harbors a highly diverse bacterial community as shown by several thousand species-level operational taxonomic units (OTU)0.97. Only 4-8 single grains are needed to cover 50% of OTU0.97 richness found in bulk sediment. Although bacterial communities differed between sand grains, a core community accounting for >50% of all cells was present on each sand grain.

509,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are suggested to occur in interstellar media and ice grains. It is important to characterize hydrated PAHs and their cations to explore their stability in interstellar and biological media. Herein, the infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectrum of the naphthalene+-H2O radical cation (Np+-H2O) recorded in the O-H and C-H stretch range is analysed by dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level to determine its structure and intermolecular bonding. Monohydration of Np+ in its 2Au ground electronic state leads to the formation of a bifurcated CHO ionic hydrogen bond (H-bond), in which the lone pairs of H2O bind to two adjacent CH proton donors of the two aromatic rings. The frequency-dependent branching ratios observed for IRPD of cold Np+-H2O-Ar clusters allows the estimation of the dissociation energy of Np+-H2O as D0 âˆ¼ 2800 Â± 300 cm-1. The monohydration motif of Np+ differs qualitatively from that of the benzene cation in both structure and binding energy, indicating the strong influence of the multiple aromatic rings on the hydration of PAH+ cations. This difference is rationalized by natural bond orbital analysis of the ionic H-bond motif. Comparison with neutral Np-H2O reveals the large change in structure and bond strength of the hydrated PAHs upon ionization. While neutral Np-H2O is stabilized by weak Ï€ H-bonds (OHÏ€, Ï€-stacking), strong cation-dipole forces favour a planar bifurcated CHO ionic H-bond in Np+-H2O.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192906,2017,Infrared spectroscopy of hydrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cations: naphthalene+-water.,n

We have demonstrated the relationship between molecular structures and related X-ray spectroscopies. The dependence of the XPS spectra on the structures of the seven C80 molecules is imperfect, while the NEXAFS spectra show strong dependence on the seven fullerene molecules, so the NEXAFS spectra can be employed to identify all of the studied isomers.

511,"To understand the relationship between the narrowing of an emission band and structural changes, we synthesised tetradentate Pt-complexes. Pt-1 has two directly connected carbazole (Cz) moieties, Pt-2 has two additional methyl groups to Pt-1, and Pt-3 has one Cz moiety. The absorption and emission spectra of Pt-2 were identical to those of Pt-1. Pt-3's emission was observed at a shorter wavelength compared to the others. We achieved phosphorescence with high colour purity by introducing a tetradentate ligand. All the Pt-complexes showed a vibronic structure in the emission spectra measured at 77 and 300 K. The 0-0 vibronic band of the Pt-complexes is quite intense compared to the 0-1 vibronic band, which may be due to less structural change of the fused tetradentate ligand in the excited state relative to the ground state. The spacing of the 0-0 and 1-0 vibronic bands is 1487 and 1323 cm-1, respectively. To understand the origin of the satellite vibronic bands, we carried out vibrational spectroscopic (IR and Raman) measurements and theoretical calculations to analyse the infrared spectrum. In addition, we carried out a transient Raman experiment to obtain the vibronic information of an excited Pt-1. The vibronic spacing in the emission was caused by the displacement of the potential energy curve in the excited state. The highest occupied molecular orbital is populated with a Cz moiety and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is localized at the terminal pyridine moiety. For the triplet state, however, the highest singly occupied molecular orbital is delocalized on the pyrazole or imidazole moiety, as well as the pyridine moiety. These groups are located at the terminal site of the ligand, and are less rigidified and more flexible. Therefore, the major origin of the satellite vibration band in emission spectra is the stretching of the terminal groups.",England,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,29192908,2017,A spectroscopic study on the satellite vibronic band in phosphorescent Pt-complexes with high colour purity.,n

513,"Copper ions (Cu2+) play a critical role in biological processes and are directly involved in Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) aggregation, which is responsible for the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, combined determination of Cu2+ and AÎ² in one analytical system is of great significance to understand the exact nature of the AD event. This work presents a novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensor for the dual determination of Cu2+ and AÎ²1-42. This unique sensor is based on a 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)-bi functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (ABTS-PDDA/CNTs) composite. The inclusion of ABTS not only enhanced the sensitivity, but it also acted as an inner reference molecule to improve detection accuracy. The specific recognition of Cu2+ was realized by neurokinin B (NKB) coatings on the ABTS-PDDA/CNTs surface to form a [CuII(NKB)2] complex with Cu2+. The ABTS-PDDA/CNTs-NKB modified electrode also displayed an excellent electrochemical response toward the AÎ²1-42 monomer, when a certain amount of the AÎ²1-42 monomer was added to Cu2+-contained PBS buffer, which was due to the release of Cu2+ from the [CuII(NKB)2] complex through AÎ² binding to Cu2+. Meanwhile, our work showed that Cu2+ bound AÎ²1-42 was concentration-dependent. Consequently, the presented electrochemical approach was capable of quantifying two important biological species associated with AD by one single biosensor, with the detection limits of 0.04 Î¼M for Cu2+ and 0.5 ng mL-1 for AÎ²1-42, respectively. Finally, the ratiometric electrode was successfully applied for monitoring Cu2+ and AÎ²1-42 variations in plasma and hippocampus of normal and AD rats.",England,The Analyst,29192910,2017,Combined determination of copper ions and Î²-amyloid peptide by a single ratiometric electrochemical biosensor.,n

515,"The extensive range of chemical structures, wide range of abundances, and chemical instability of metabolites present in the metabolome pose major analytical challenges that are difficult to address with existing technologies. To address these issues, one approach is to target a subset of metabolites that share a functional group, such as ketones and aldehydes, using chemoselective tagging. Here we report a greatly improved chemoselective method for the quantitative analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbonyl-containing metabolites directly in biological samples. This method is based on direct tissue or cells extraction with simultaneous derivatization of stable and labile carbonylated metabolites using N-[2-(aminooxy)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecylammonium (QDA) and 13CD3 labeled QDA. We combined innovations of direct quenching of biological sample with frozen derivatization conditions under the catalyst N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, which facilitated the formation of oxime stable-isotope ion pairs differing by m/z 4.02188 while minimizing metabolite degradation. The resulting oximes were extracted by HyperSep C8 tips to remove interfering compounds, and the products were detected using nano-electrospray ionization interfaced with a Thermo Fusion mass spectrometer. The quaternary ammonium tagging greatly increased electrospray MS detection sensitivity and the signature ions pairs enabled simple identification of carbonyl compounds. The improved method showed the lower limits of quantification for carbonyl standards to be in the range of 0.20-2 nM, with linearity of R2 > 0.99 over 4 orders of magnitude. We have applied the method to assign 66 carbonyls in mouse tumor tissues, many of which could not be assigned solely by accurate mass and tandem MS.

It is reported that under oxidative stress-loaded conditions, astrocytes exhibit increased intra- and extra-cellular labile zinc, the latter triggering microglial M1 activation, while the pathophysiological role of the former remains unrevealed. In this study, we examined whether the oxidative stress-induced increase of intracellular labile zinc is involved in the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R)-mediated regulation of astrocytic engulfing activity. The exposure of cultured astrocytes to sub-lethal oxidative stress through their treatment with 400 Î¼M H2O2 increased intracellular labile zinc, of which the concentration reached a peak level of approximately 2 Î¼M at 2 h after the treatment. In astrocytes under sub-lethal oxidative stress, the uptake of YO-PRO-1 and latex beads as markers for P2X7R channel/pore activity and astrocytic engulfing activity, respectively, was decreased, and these decreased activities were accompanied by decreased expression of P2X7R at the plasma membrane via intracellular labile zinc-mediated translocation of it. With the oxidative stress, the expression level of full length P2X7R relative to that of its splice variants in astrocytes was decreased, leading to a decrease of the relative expression of the trimer consisting of full length P2X7R.

524,"Geminate recombination of 24 radical anions (MË™-) with solvated protons (RH2+) was studied in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with pulse radiolysis. The recombination has two steps: (1) diffusion of MË™- and RH2+ together to form intimate (contact and solvent separated) ion pairs, driven by Coulomb attraction; (2) annihilation of anions due to proton transfer (PT) from RH2+ to MË™-. The non-exponential time-dependence of the geminate diffusion was determined. For all molecules protonated on O or N atoms the subsequent PT step is too fast (<0.2 ns) to measure, except for the anion of TCNE which did not undergo proton transfer. PT to C atoms was as slow as 70 ns and was always slow enough to be observable. A possible effect of charge delocalization on the PT rates could not be clearly separated from other factors.

It is widely accepted that a 1D system with a short-range interaction cannot have 1D phase transition at finite temperature. Herein, we propose a series of new stable carbon nanotubes by rolling up penta-graphene sheets, which exhibit fascinating well-defined 1D phase transitions triggered by axial strain. Our first-principles calculations show that such penta-graphene nanotubes (PGNTs) are dynamically stable by phonon calculations, but transform from a tri-layer structure to a highly defective single-walled nanotube at low temperature in molecular dynamics simulations. We show that moderate compressive strains can drive structural transitions of (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6) PGNTs, during which the distances of neighboring carbon dimers in the inner shell have a sudden drop, corresponding to dimer-dimer nonbonding to bonding transitions. After such transition, the tubes become much more thermally stable and undergo semiconductor-metal transitions under increasing strain. The band gaps of PGNTs are not sensitive to chirality whereas they can be tuned effectively from visible to short-wavelength infrared by appropriate strain, making them appealing materials for flexible nano-optoelectronics.

Here we demonstrate that a scanning electron beam can be used to artificially create domain configurations within La0.3Pr0.4Ca0.3MnO3 thin film microbridges that results in novel magneto-transport effects. In particular, the electron beam preferentially produces insulating regions within the narrow film and can be used to create a configuration consisting of ferromagnetic metallic domains separated by a potential barrier. This arrangement enables the spin-dependent tunneling of charge carriers and can produce large switching tunneling magnetoresistance effects which were initially absent. Hence, this work describes a new and potentially powerful method for engineering the electronic phase domains in manganites to generate functional transport properties that are important for spintronic devices.",England,Nanoscale,29192923,2017,Electron beam induced tunneling magnetoresistance in spatially confined manganite bridges.,n
527,"Nickel-manganese spinel oxide (NiMn2O4) was hybridized with reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGOH) via a facile solvothermal process and a highly porous three-dimensional (3D) structure was constructed. NiMn2O4/rGOH exhibited excellent electrochemical performance due to the high specific surface area, excellent electrocatalytic activity, and enhanced electrical conductivity due to the synergetic effects between the two components. The NiMn2O4/rGOH exhibited excellent glucose sensing performance with high sensitivity (1310.8 Î¼A mM-1 cm-2), a wide linear range (2 Î¼M-20 mM), rapid response time (<3.5 s), and anti-interference properties. Furthermore, it also showed excellent supercapacitor performance with a high capacitance (396.85 F g-1) and excellent energy and power density on account of the large surface area and pseudo-capacitor behavior of NiMn2O4.

528,"Conducting probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) was employed to examine electron tunneling in self-assembled monolayer (SAM) junctions. A 2.3 nm long perylene tetracarboxylic acid diimide (PDI) acceptor molecule equipped with isocyanide linker groups was synthesized, adsorbed onto Ag, Au and Pt substrates, and the current-voltage (I-V) properties were measured by CP-AFM. The dependence of the low-bias resistance (R) on contact work function indicates that transport is LUMO-assisted ('n-type behavior'). A single-level tunneling model combined with transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) was employed to analyze the experimental I-V curves and to extract the effective LUMO position Îµl = ELUMO - EF and the effective electronic coupling (Î“) between the PDI redox core and the contacts. This analysis revealed a strong Fermi level (EF) pinning effect in all the junctions, likely due to interface dipoles that significantly increased with increasing contact work function, as revealed by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM). Furthermore, the temperature (T) dependence of R was found to be substantial. For Pt/Pt junctions, R varied more than two orders of magnitude in the range 248 K < T < 338 K. Importantly, the R(T) data are consistent with a single step electron tunneling mechanism and allow independent determination of Îµl, giving values compatible with estimates of Îµl based on analysis of the full I-V data. Theoretical analysis revealed a general criterion to unambiguously rule out a two-step transport mechanism: namely, if measured resistance data exhibit a pronounced Arrhenius-type temperature dependence, a two-step electron transfer scenario should be excluded in cases where the activation energy depends on contact metallurgy. Overall, our results indicate (1) the generality of the Fermi level pinning phenomenon in molecular junctions, (2) the utility of employing the single level tunneling model for determining essential electronic structure parameters (Îµl and Î“), and (3) the importance of changing the nature of the contacts to verify transport mechanisms.",England,Nanoscale,29192925,2017,Work function and temperature dependence of electron tunneling through an N-type perylene diimide molecular junction with isocyanide surface linkers.,n
529,"The ability to apply highly controlled electric fields within microfluidic devices is valuable as a basis for preparative and analytical processes. A challenge encountered in the context of such approaches in conductive media, including aqueous buffers, is the generation of electrolysis products at the electrode/liquid interface which can lead to contamination, perturb fluid flows and generally interfere with the measurement process. Here, we address this challenge by designing a single layer microfluidic device architecture where the electric potential is applied outside and downstream of the microfluidic device while the field is propagated back to the chip via the use of a co-flowing highly conductive electrolyte solution that forms a stable interface at the separation region of the device. The co-flowing electrolyte ensures that all the generated electrolysis products, including Joule heat and gaseous products, are flowed away from the chip without coming into contact with the analytes while the single layer fabrication process where all the structures are defined lithographically allows producing the devices in a simple yet highly reproducible manner. We demonstrate that by allowing stable and effective application of electric fields in excess of 100 V cm-1, the described platform provides the basis for rapid separation of heterogeneous mixtures of proteins and protein complexes directly in their native buffers as well as for the simultaneous quantification of their charge states. We illustrate this by probing the interactions in a mixture of an amyloid forming protein, amyloid-Î², and a molecular chaperone, Brichos, known to inhibit the process of amyloid formation. The availability of a platform for applying stable electric fields and its compatibility with single-layer soft-lithography processes opens up the possibility of separating and analysing a wide range of molecules on chip, including those with similar electrophoretic mobilities.",England,Lab on a chip,29192926,2017,On-chip label-free protein analysis with downstream electrodes for direct removal of electrolysis products.,n
530,"Three series of six pyrazine-2-amidoxime (H2pzaox)-based 3d-4f clusters, {Ln8Ni6}, {Ln5Ni10} and {Ln5Ni8} (Ln = Dy and Gd), were solvothermally synthesized in the absence or presence of different coligands, and were structurally and magnetically characterized. The unusual ring-shaped {Ln8(Î¼3-OH)4} core in the two {Ln8Ni6} complexes is generated by four corner-sharing triangle {Ln3(Î¼3-OH)} units, which are further connected to six outer NiII ions by twelve deprotonated H2pzaox ligands in three common binding modes. By contrast, the remaining four clusters contain only two corner-sharing {Ln3(Î¼3-OH)} triangles, which interact with peripheral NiII ions through fourteen H2pzaox ligands in five (for {Ln5Ni10}) and four (for {Ln5Ni8}) different bridging ways. Thus, the interesting core motifs observed in these clusters depend significantly on the number of the triangular {Ln3(Î¼3-OH)} subunits and their connectivity manner with the singly and doubly deprotonated pyrazine-2-amidoxime ligand. Additionally, weak ferromagnetic superexchange in the {Dy5Ni10} and {Ln5Ni8} clusters and antiferromagnetic coupling in {Ln8Ni6} and {Gd5Ni10} clusters was respectively mediated by versatile oximate bridges between the intramolecular LnIII and NiII ions. Furthermore, the three DyIII-derived aggregates exhibit slightly temperature-dependent magnetic relaxations under a zero dc field, and the three GdIII-based clusters display large magnetic entropy changes of 23.5 J kg-1 K-1 for {Gd8Ni6}, 19.4 J kg-1 K-1 for {Gd5Ni10}, and 22.4 J kg-1 K-1 for {Ln5Ni8} at 4.0 K and 70 kOe.

532,"We investigate creeping viscoelastic fluid flow through two-dimensional porous media consisting of random arrangements of monodisperse and bidisperse cylinders, using our finite volume-immersed boundary method introduced in S. De, et al., J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., 2016, 232, 67-76. The viscoelastic fluid is modeled with a FENE-P model. The simulations show an increased flow resistance with increase in flow rate, even though the bulk response of the fluid to shear flow is shear thinning. We show that if the square root of the permeability is chosen as the characteristic length scale in the determination of the dimensionless Deborah number (De), then all flow resistance curves collapse to a single master curve, irrespective of the pore geometry. Our study reveals how viscoelastic stresses and flow topologies (rotation, shear and extension) are distributed through the porous media, and how they evolve with increasing De. We correlate the local viscoelastic first normal stress differences with the local flow topology and show that the largest normal stress differences are located in shear flow dominated regions and not in extensional flow dominated regions at higher viscoelasticity. The study shows that normal stress differences in shear flow regions may play a crucial role in the increase of flow resistance for viscoelastic flow through such porous media.",England,Soft matter,29192929,2017,"Viscoelastic flow past mono- and bidisperse random arrays of cylinders: flow resistance, topology and normal stress distribution.",n
533,"We report here that a dense liquid formed by spontaneous condensation, also known as simple coacervation, of a single mussel foot protein-3S-mimicking peptide exhibits properties critical for underwater adhesion. A structurally homogeneous coacervate is deposited on underwater surfaces as micrometer-thick layers, and, after compression, displays orders of magnitude higher underwater adhesion at 2 N m-1 than that reported from thin films of the most adhesive mussel-foot-derived peptides or their synthetic mimics. The increase in adhesion efficiency does not require nor rely on post-deposition curing or chemical processing, but rather represents an intrinsic physical property of the single-component coacervate. Its wet adhesive and rheological properties correlate with significant dehydration, tight peptide packing and restriction in peptide mobility. We suggest that such dense coacervate liquids represent an essential adaptation for the initial priming stages of mussel adhesive deposition, and provide a hitherto untapped design principle for synthetic underwater adhesives.",England,Soft matter,29192930,2017,Simple peptide coacervates adapted for rapid pressure-sensitive wet adhesion.,n

In comparison with the above tridentate complexes, the bidentate bis(aryloxide-NHC) nickel complex Ni4 was also synthesized. On activation with either Et2AlCl or Me2AlCl, all nickel complexes showed low activity toward norbornene (NB) homopolymerization. Surprisingly, Ni1-Ni3 catalysts exhibited moderate to high activity toward the homopolymerization (up to 3.21 Ã— 106 g PNB (mol of Ni)-1 h-1) and copolymerization of norbornene with 1-octene (up to 1.39 Ã— 105 g polymer (mol of Ni)-1 h-1) with B(C6F5)3 as the cocatalyst even at 100 Â°C, showing that tridentate nickel catalysts have high thermal stability. Notably, the tridentate Ni1-Ni3 complexes showed better activities than the corresponding bidentate bis(aryloxide-NHC) nickel complex Ni4.

The authors identified all primary TKA procedures performed in 2014 at the 2 facilities. Each patient at the orthopedic specialty hospital was manually matched to a patient at the tertiary referral center according to demographic and clinical variables. Matching was blinded to outcomes. Outcomes were 90-day readmission, mortality rate, reoperation, length of stay, and use of inpatient rehabilitation. Each group had 215 TKA patients. The 2 groups of patients were similar in age (66.8 years, P=.98), body mass index (30.4 kg/m2, P=.99), age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (3.4, P=1.00), and sex (46.0% male, P=1.00). Mean length of stay was 1.47Â±0.62 days at the orthopedic specialty hospital vs 1.87Â±0.75 days (P<.01) at the tertiary referral center. There were 3 readmissions at the orthopedic specialty hospital and 6 readmissions at the tertiary referral center (P=.31). There were 6 reoperations at the orthopedic specialty hospital and 5 at the tertiary referral center (P=.76). In addition, 8 patients at the orthopedic specialty hospital used inpatient rehabilitation vs 15 patients at the tertiary referral center (P=.08). One patient who was treated at the orthopedic specialty hospital required transfer to a tertiary referral center. This study found that perioperative outcomes were similar for matched patients who underwent primary TKA at an orthopedic specialty hospital and a tertiary referral center. Patients treated at the orthopedic specialty hospital spent 0.4 fewer days in the hospital compared with matched patients who were treated at the tertiary referral center. This equals 2 fewer hospital nights for every 5 TKA patients.

537,"Baseball pitching imposes significant stress on the upper extremity and can lead to injury. Many studies have attempted to predict injury through pitching mechanics, most of which have used laboratory setups that are often not practical for population-based analysis. This study sought to predict injury risk in professional baseball pitchers using a statistical model based on video analysis evaluating delivery mechanics in a large population. Career data were collected and video analysis was performed on a random sample of former and current professional pitchers. Delivery mechanics were analyzed using 6 categories: mass and momentum, arm swing, posture, position at foot strike, path of arm acceleration, and finish. Effects of demographics and delivery scores on injury were determined using a survival analysis, and model validity was assessed. A total of 449 professional pitchers were analyzed. Risk of injury significantly increased with later birth date, role as reliever vs starter, and previous major injury. Risk of injury significantly decreased with increase in overall delivery score (7.8%) and independently with increase in score of the mass and momentum (16.5%), arm swing (12.0%), and position at foot strike (22.8%) categories. The accuracy of the model in predicting injury was significantly better when including total delivery score compared with demographic factors alone. This study presents a model that evaluates delivery mechanics and predicts injury risk of professional pitchers based on video analysis and demographic variables. This model can be used to assess injury risk of professional pitchers and can be potentially expanded to assess injury risk in pitchers at other levels.

This study evaluated the outcomes of military servicemembers after surgical treatment of distal clavicle fractures. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of active duty servicemembers who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of Neer type II distal clavicle fractures between October 17, 2007, and July 20, 2012, with a minimum of 2-year clinical follow-up. The electronic health record was queried to extract demographic features and clinical outcomes, primarily persistence of pain, removal of hardware, and postoperative return to high-level activity. A total of 48 patients were identified, with mean follow-up of 3.8 years. A total of 44% of patients underwent subsequent hardware removal. All fractures achieved radiographic union, and 35% of patients had persistence of symptoms. Patients who were treated with hook plating had a 3.64-fold higher risk of persistence of pain compared with those treated with conventional plating techniques. A total of 35% of patients successfully returned to full military function and completed a postoperative military deployment. Coracoclavicular reconstruction did not improve outcomes. Persistence of symptoms and requirement for hardware removal were not associated with the rate of postoperative deployment. Achieving excellent functional outcomes with open reduction and internal fixation of distal clavicle fractures remains a challenge. Where possible, conventional plate fixation should be considered over hook plate fixation.

In recent years, the recovery-oriented approaches (along with experiences and thoughts of patients and patient's relatives) have been taken into account for establishing mental health services and policies. This study aims to identify the factors contributing to recovery, as observed from the perspective of schizophrenia patients working at The Blue Horse CafÃ© which was founded by the Federation of Schizophrenia Associations.


METHOD
The sample for the study consisted of 24 patients who worked at The Blue Horse CafÃ©. A phenomenological approach was used in the study, whereby interviews with patients were analyzed qualitatively.


RESULTS
Certain common factors, which were expressed as having contributed to recovery, were identified from the perspective of schizophrenia patients.

All participants were evaluated with neurocognitive tests. The plasma IL-6 and IL-18 levels of both groups were measured with ELISA kits.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between IL-6 and IL-18 levels of patient and healthy control groups. In the patient group, IL-18 level was positively correlated with completed categories score wheras there was a negative correlation with perseverative response and perseverative errors. Moreover IL-18 level was positively correlated with immediate recall, delayed recall and learning scores while there was a negative correlation with stroop interference scores. No correlation was found between IL-6 level and neuropsychological test scores in the patient group.

This study aimed to examine the cognitive profiles of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the latter of which was recently standardized in Turkey. In addition, the reading abilities and intelligence scores of these children were also investigated.


METHODS
A total of 48 children with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 16 years who were outpatients in MuÅŸ State Hospital were included in this study. The children were administered the WISC-R, the WISC-IV, and the Oral Reading Skills and Reading Comprehension Test (ORCT).

CONCLUSION
Results of this study suggest that the WISC-R and the WISC-IV scale are not sufficient for obtaining a specific cognitive profile for ADHD - there is no significant difference between them.

Since the presence of psychiatric comorbidities may disrupt neuropsychological functions, results of studies that have not controlled comorbidity may be questionable. However, studies that excluded the comorbid conditions reported similar deficits in cognitive functions in PTSD patients. The relationship between recovery from PTSD symptoms and change in cognitive functions has been examined in only a few studies, and most have reported an improvement for both memory and executive functions in remitted patients. The improvement in executive functions, however, has been limited by the difficulty of task. Cognitive deficits have been among the major causes of disabilities in PTSD patients. Therefore, the amount of improvement in cognitive dysfunctions by current treatments of PTSD deserves more attention.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192945,2017,[Cognitive Dysfunctions in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder].,y

550,"Prefrontal cortex in frontal lobe (FL) is the center of executive functions (EF). FL damage can lead to executive dysfunction by influencing frontal-subcortical circuits (dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, ventromedial). Damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can lead to deterioration in EF, whereas damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) can lead to personality changes with the characteristic of disinhibition and irritability. In addition, damage to the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) can result in decreased spontaneity. Neuropsychological tests are important components in the assessment of EF including goal-directed behavior, decision-making, risk assessment, making plans for the future, setting of priorities and order of our actions. Clinical conditions affecting frontal-subcortical connections outside of the FL can also lead to executive dysfunctions and frontal lobe syndrome (FLS).

The optimal approach to coronary bifurcations treatment by PCI is still a subject of debate and the dedicated bifurcation stents are one of proposed solutions.


AIM
The aim of this report was to assess effectiveness and safety profile of a new dedicated bifurcation stent - sirolimus-eluting BiOSSÂ® LIM C (Balton, Poland) at the first 3 months of the 12-month Registry.


METHODS
This is the two-center registry, which enrolls patients with NSTE-ACS and stable angina. Provisional T-stenting is the obligatory strategy of the treatment. Angiographic control is planned at 12 months. The primary endpoint is the cumulative rate of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months.


RESULTS
A total of 48 patients with lesions in coronary bifurcations were enrolled (mean age 67.9Â±8.9 years, 14.6% of female). There were 20.8% of patients with NSTE-ACS, 93.8% with hypertension, 35.4% with diabetes, 52.1% had previous MI, and 47.9% and 14.6% underwent prior PCI and CABG, respectively. The device success rate was 100%. The side branch was treated with an additional classical DES implantation in 18.8% of cases. The periprocedural MI (MI type 4a) was observed in two cases (4.2%). At 3 months there was one case (2.1%) of TLR. No death, MI or stent thrombosis were observed.


CONCLUSION
Bifurcation treatment with a single dedicated bifurcation stent (BiOSS LIM C) is feasible and highly successful (100% implantation success rate).

555,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Bleeding complications are frequent and independently impact mortality after TAVI. Thromboelastography (TEG) measures viscoelastic properties of clot formation and is currently best known for perioperative management to reduce blood transfusion in cardiac surgery. We sought to determine whether TEG may be predictive of bleeding in patients treated with TAVI.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Overall, 54 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVI were prospectively included. In all patients, 2 blood samples were obtained for TEG measurement (1st - 12h prior to procedure tested with Citrated Kaolin [CK] TEG assay, and the 2nd - immediately after prosthesis deployment tested with CK and Citrated Kaolin Heparinised assay [CKH]). Major or life-threatening bleeding (MLTB) was diagnosed in 13 (24%) patients. In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis the only TEG parameters showing significant sensitivity and specificity for predicting MLTB were those obtained in the CK sample at the end of the procedure: R value (reaction time, time to initiation of clot formation) AUC 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49-0.88, P=0.04; Angle (the rate of clot formation), AUC 0.75, 95%CI 0.59-0.92, P=0.007 and MA (maximum amplitude, ultimate strength of fibrin clot), AUC 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.93, P=0.003. After controlling for confounding factors in multivariate logistic regression, MA remained as the only TEG parameter which significantly correlated with bleeding after TAVI, both as a continuous variable (P=0.004; 95%CI 0.92-0.98; OR 0.95 per 1mm increment) and after using the cut-off value derived from ROC analysis; MA <46.6 mm (P=0.004; OR 10.4; 95%CI 2.1-51.8).


CONCLUSIONS
Low strength of fibrin clot measured by TEG immediately after TAVI may serve as an independent predictor of short-term major and life-threatening bleeding complications.",Poland,Kardiologia polska,29192952,2017,Thromboelastography for predicting bleeding in patients with aortic stenosis treated with TAVI.,n

BehÃ§et's disease (BD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with symptoms manifesting from an underlying vasculitis. Since the disease activity is correlated with the characteristic vascular endothelial dysfunction, BD places individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for arteriosclerotic vascular diseases. This study was designed to investigate how plasma homocysteine (Hcy) effects the structural and functional properties of the carotid artery in humans.


METHODS
Sixty-eight BD patients with subclinical atherosclerosis and 40 healthy controls underwent carotid sonography and Doppler ultrasound to measure carotid artery intima-media thickness (C-IMT) and carotid stiffness and distensibility (indicating elasticity). Total (t) Hcy level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For analysis, the BD patients were subgrouped according to hyperhomocysteinemia (>15 Î¼mol/L Hcy).


RESULTS
The patients with BD were found to have increased C-IMT and Î² stiffness and decreased distensibility. In addition, hyperhomocysteinemia was significantly correlated with these detrimental changes in the carotid artery, possibly raising the risk of these patients for development of atherosclerosis.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings reveal a potential mechanism of atherosclerosis in BD and highlight the processes that future research should focus on to address identification and prophylactic treatment of BD patients at risk of CVD.",Poland,Kardiologia polska,29192953,2017,Relationship between serum homocysteine levels and structural-functional carotid arterial abnormalities in inactive BehÃ§et's disease.,n

Cardionhibitory syncope is related with excessive bradycardia or asystole due to parasympathetic response.


AIM
We investigated whether patients with cardioinhibitory syncope have higher heart rate recovery index (HRRi) considered as an parasympathetic system activation in exercises stress testing (EST) than other those with other neurogenic syncope forms METHODS: A total of 262 patients who had neurogenic syncope documented by head-up tilt test (HUTT) and 199 healthy control individuals were examined. A maximal EST was applied to all patients after the HUTT. The HRRi was obtained by subtracting the heart rate that was measured at the first (HRRi-1), second (HRRi-2) and third minute (HRRi-3) of the recovery period from the maximal heart rate that was measured during the test.


RESULTS
80 patients had cardioinhibitory syncope, 118 patients had vasodepressor syncope, and 64 patients had mixed type syncope. The HRRi-1 was higher in patients with syncope (43.3Â±7.7) compared to the control group (34.5Â±4.8) (p<0.001). Among the syncope groups, there was no difference between patients with vasodepressor syncope (42.2Â±7.6) and patients with mixed type syncope (40.7Â±4.1) in terms of HRRi-1 according to post hoc analysis (p=0.420). However, patients with cardioinhibitory syncope (47Â±8.7) had a higher HRRi-1 than vasodepressor and mixed type syncope groups (p<0.05). The threshold value of the HRRi-1, which can be used for the prediction of cardioinhbitory syncope development, was determined to be 41 with 75% sensitivity and 72% specificity.

558,"BACKGROUND
Professional drivers are a group exposed to many cardiovascular risk factors. Non-systematic working hours, prolonged stress, low physical activity, along with irregular, in most cases, unhealthy meals are common aspects of the normal working schedule of most of the professional drivers. These translate into high risk of cardiovascular disease.


AIM
The aim of the current analysis was to establish the prevalence of dyslipidaemia in a group of continuous professional drivers.


METHODS
The RACER (Risk of Adverse Cardiovascular Events among professional dRivers in Poland - Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring) study is a prospective study focused on assessing cardiovascular risk factors in professional drivers. Patients included in the study were screened for the classical and non-classical cardiovascular risk factors and had an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed. Out of the whole RACER study population, 144 drivers were included into the RACER-ABPM study.


RESULTS
Out of this group 135 (95.7%) were male, and the mean age was 50.2Â±9.3 years, and mean body mass index was 32.3Â±3.0 kg/m2. The family history of cardiovascular disease was noted in 21.3% of patients, 28.1% were current smokers and 2.9% had diabetes mellitus. Out of those patients, 72,2% had LDL cholesterol level >115mg/dl, 85.5% had LDL-C >100mg/dl and 96.7% had LDL-C >70mg/dl. HDL cholesterol <40mg/dl in men and <45mg/dl in woman was present in 84.4% of cases. Triglycerides >150mg/dl were found in 28.9% of cases.

Haemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn secondary to clinically significant non-Rhesus-D antibodies has risen in importance since the advent of immunoprophylactic anti-D administration to Rhesus-D negative women. Of interest is the incidence of these antibodies in Rhesus-D positive women, who receive less frequent antenatal alloantibody screening. This is of particular concern if the antibodies arise late in pregnancy and may go undetected.


AIMS
To assess the proportion of Rhesus-D positive pregnant women with late developing clinically significant antibodies for haemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn, and whether these resulted in adverse fetal outcomes.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective analysis over a 12-month period at a tertiary hospital in the Northern Territory. Group and antibody screen results in addition to clinical data regarding pregnancy/newborn were collected.


RESULTS
Sixty-four of 2612 women (2.5%) had red blood cell antibodies detected during their pregnancy. Of these, 21 clinically significant antibodies were detected in 19 women (0.7% of initial cohort). The most common antibody detected was anti-c (28.5%). In six of these women (0.23% of initial cohort), the antibodies were late developing. Mild jaundice was noted in three newborns with phototherapy required in one.


CONCLUSIONS
Although clinically significant antibodies were detected during pregnancy, and in a small proportion of cases as a late developing antibody undetected in the first trimester screening, clinical outcomes for the newborn were mild.

To assess the 60-day readmission rates after hysterectomy according to route of surgery and analyze risk factors for postoperative readmission.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
This retrospective study included all women who underwent hysterectomy due to benign conditions from 2009-2015 at a large academic center in Boston. Readmission rates were compared among the following four types of hysterectomies: abdominal (AH), laparoscopic (LH), robotic (RH) and vaginal (VH).


RESULTS
There were 3,981 hysterectomy cases over the study period (628 AH, 2500 LH, 155 RH and 698 VH). Intra-operative complications occurred more frequently in women undergoing AH (4.8%), followed by RH (3.9%), VH (1.9%) and LH (1.6%), (p<0.0001). Readmission rates were not significantly different among the groups; women receiving AH had an overall readmission rate of 3.5%, compared to 3.2% after RH, 2.9% after VH and 1.9% after LH (p=0.06). When stratifying for relevant variables, women who had a LH had a twofold reduction of readmission compared to AH (OR=0.52, 95% CI 0.31, 0.87; p=0.01). There was not a significant difference in readmission when RH or VH were compared individually to AH. Regarding risk factors related to readmission it was observed that perioperative complications were the largest driver of readmissions (OR=667, 95% CI 158, 999; p<0.0001).


CONCLUSION
The laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy was associated with fewer hospital readmissions compared to the abdominal route while vaginal, robotic and abdominal approaches had similar risk of readmission. Perioperative complications represent the main driver of readmissions. After adjusting for perioperative factors such as surgeon type and complications, no difference in readmissions between the different routes of hysterectomy were found.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is often misdiagnosed. This can cause problems if conducting register-based studies. The study purpose was to produce algorithms that better identify patients with correct diagnosis of IIH in the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR).


METHODS
Patients with ICD-10 code G93.2 for IIH registered in the NPR (2006-2013, Stockholm County) were included and diagnosis validated by medical record reviews. Patients were randomized into two groups: one used to produce the algorithm (nÂ =Â 105) and one for validation (nÂ =Â 102). We tested variables possible to extract from registries and used forward stepwise logistic regression which provided a predicted probability of correct diagnosis for each patient.


RESULTS
We included 207 patients of which 135 had confirmed IIH. This gave a positive predictive value of 65.2% (CI: 58.4-71.4).

Dementia-related behavioral symptoms and functional dependence result in poor quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The goal was to determine whether a home-based activity program (Tailored Activity Program; TAP-VA) would reduce behavioral symptoms and functional dependence of veterans with dementia and caregiver burden.


DESIGN
Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).


SETTING
Veteran's homes.


PARTICIPANTS
Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).


INTERVENTION
Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.


MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.


RESULTS
Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control). At 4 months, compared to controls, the TAP-VA group showed reductions in number (difference in mean change from baseline = -0.68, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.13) and frequency by severity (-24.3, 95% CI = -45.6 to -3.1) of behavioral symptoms, number of activities needing assistance with (-0.80, 95% CI = -1.41 to -0.20), functional dependence level (4.09, 95% CI = 1.06, 7.13), and pain (-1.18, 95% CI = -2.10 to -0.26). Caregivers of veterans in TAP-VA reported less behavior-related distress. Benefits did not extend to 8 months.

In contrast to existing graphical approaches, our method allows one to succinctly characterize the simultaneous and independent effects of covariates on reproducibility and to compare reproducibility while controlling for potential confounding variables. We also establish a connection between our model and certain Archimedean copula models. This connection not only offers our regression framework an interpretation in copula models, but also provides guidance on choosing the functional forms of the regression. Furthermore, it also opens a new way to interpret and utilize these copulas in the context of reproducibility.

The question whether universal growth charts can be used in multi-ethnic settings is of general interest. The Intergrowth-21st (IG-21) fetal growth and newborn size standards are suggested to represent optimal fetal growth regardless of country origin. Our aim was to examine whether women fulfilling the strict IG-21 inclusion criteria were healthier, showed less ethnic differences in fetal growth and newborn size, and less adverse perinatal outcomes.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data were drawn from a population-based multi-ethnic cohort of 823 presumably healthy pregnant women in Oslo, Norway. We assessed differences in fetal and neonatal gestational age specific z-scores and compared maternal health parameters, pregnancy- and birth complications between pregnancies fulfilling and not fulfilling the IG-21 criteria.


RESULTS
Only 21% of pregnancies enrolled in our cohort fulfilled the IG-21 criteria. Fetal growth deviated substantially from the new standards, in particular for ethnic Europeans. Ethnic differences persisted in pregnancies fulfilling the criteria.In South Asian fetuses estimated fetal weight was -0.60 SD (95% CI: -1.00, -0.20) lower at 24 gestational weeks, and birthweight was -0.62 SD (-0.95, -0.29) lower, compared with ethnic Europeans. Corresponding numbers for Middle-East/N-Africans were -0.13 (-0.62, 0.36) and -0.60 (-1.00, -0.20). Maternal health indicators and birth complications were similar in women fulfilling and not fulfilling the criteria, or the relation depended on ethnic origin.

606,"BACKGROUND
We previously described the principal results from an observational, prospective, multi-centre, clinical trial of the diagnostic value of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in a clinical setting. In this trial, much additional useful information was gathered that warranted further analysis, presented here.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the influence of candidate diagnostic criteria, OCT image quality, lesion location, and observer confidence and inter-observer variability on the diagnostic performance, and to assess potential for diagnosis of BCC subtypes.


METHODS
A total of 234 clinically unclear ""pink lesions"" were evaluated in three steps: after clinical examination, after adding dermoscopy and finally after adding OCT. In addition to the diagnoses (including lesion subtype), observers also recorded which of 15 diagnostic criteria the OCT image contained, their confidence in the diagnoses, the OCT image quality, and the anatomical location of the lesion.


RESULTS
Diagnostic performance of OCT did not depend on the lesion anatomical location. Good OCT image quality was correlated with improved diagnostic performance; but diagnostic performance for lesions with mediocre image quality was still better than by clinical and dermoscopic examination. The main reason for reduced image quality was superficial scales and crusting. Observer confidence in their diagnosis was correlated with diagnostic performance. Inter-observer diagnostic performance was consistently higher than clinical examination and dermoscopy across all sites. BCC subtype could be determined with moderate accuracy but further independent image markers are required.

R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) has demonstrated greater activity against aggressive B-cell histologies but has not been studied in Richter Syndrome. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 46 Richter Syndrome patients treated with first-line R-EPOCH at our institution between 1 January 2006 and 31 May 2014. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3Â·5Â months [95% confidence interval (CI): 2Â·0-7Â·6] and median overall survival (OS) was 5Â·9Â months (95% CI: 3Â·2-10Â·3). Toxicity was high and 30% of patients died without progression or response. Patients with a complex CLL karyotype had significantly shorter PFS and OS (PÂ =Â 0Â·005 and PÂ =Â 0Â·002, respectively). Multivariable analysis identified complex CLL karyotype as the most significant predictor of decreased survival [Hazard ratio (HR) 2Â·72, 95% CI: 1Â·14-6Â·52, PÂ =Â 0Â·025], adjusting for number of prior CLL treatments (PÂ =Â 0Â·036).

Eye tracking presents a novel tool that could be used to profile skill levels in surgery objectively. The primary aim of this study was to identify differences in gaze behaviour between expert and junior surgeons performing a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for obesity.


METHODS
This prospective observational study used a lightweight eye-tracking apparatus to determine the difference in gaze behaviours between expert (more than 75 procedures) and junior (75 or fewer procedures) surgeons at defined stages of LRYGB. Primary endpoints were normalized dwell time and fixation frequency. Secondary endpoints were blink rate, maximum pupil size and rate of pupil change.


RESULTS
A total of 20 procedures (12 junior, 8 expert) were analysed. Compared with juniors, experts showed a prolonged dwell time on the screen during angle of His dissection (median (range) 91Â·20 (83Â·40-94Â·40) versus 68Â·95 (59Â·80-87Â·60) per cent; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·001), formation of the retrogastric tunnel (91Â·50 (85Â·80-95Â·50) versus 73Â·60 (34Â·60-90Â·50) per cent; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·001) and gastric pouch formation (86Â·95 (83Â·60-90Â·20) versus 67Â·60 (37Â·10-80Â·00) per cent Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). Juniors had a greater blink frequency throughout all recorded segments (P <â€‰0Â·010) and had a larger maximum pupil size during all recorded operative segments (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·010). Rate of pupil change was greater in juniors in all analysed segments (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·010).

To review the efficacy of perioperative antibiotics in reducing the risk of surgical site infections (SSI) following excision of ulcerated skin cancers.


SETTING AND DESIGN
Study selection, data extraction and analysis were carried out independently by four authors. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported in the English Language were included.


INCLUDED STUDIES
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the English language in which patients received perioperative topical, intralesional, or oral antibiotics for dermatological surgery including Mohs micrographic surgery in General Practice, Dermatology or Plastic Surgery Departments were included.


OUTCOME
The proportion of participants developing surgical site infection (SSI) following excision of skin lesions.


RESULTS
Thirteen RCTs17-20,26-33,35 were identified from our literature search of Pubmed and Embase which evaluated SSI following use of topical (n=5)26-29,35 , oral (n=3)17-19 , intramuscular (n=2)20,32 , intravenous (n=1)33 and intralesional antibiotics (n=2)30,31 in dermatological surgery. Two RCTs specifically investigated SSI in ulcerated skin cancer excisions; one RCT investigated SSI rate following surgical treatment specifically for ulcerated skin cancers in individuals randomised to topical antibiotics versus oral cephalexin and one RCT compared intravenous cefazolin to no antibiotic demonstrating significant reduction in SSI rates for ulcerated tumours (p=0.04).


CONCLUSION
The heterogeneity of the RCTs included in this study makes it difficult to make a direct comparison of the outcomes measured. High quality evidence demonstrating a beneficial effect of the use of peri-operative antibiotics to prevent SSI following excision of ulcerated skin cancers is lacking. In the absence of an evidence-base, we propose that a well-designed multi-centred RCT could evaluate the effect of peri-operative antibiotics following excision of ulcerated tumours, and potentially reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.

613,"BACKGROUND
The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics, treatment and prognosis of early versus late recurrence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) after hepatic resection.


METHODS
Patients who underwent resection with curative intent for ICC were identified from a multi-institutional database. Data on clinicopathological characteristics, initial operative details, timing and sites of recurrence, recurrence management and long-term outcomes were analysed.


RESULTS
A total of 933 patients were included. With a median follow-up of 22â€‰months, 685 patients (73Â·4 per cent) experienced recurrence of ICC; 406 of these (59Â·3 per cent) developed only intrahepatic disease recurrence. The optimal cutoff value to differentiate early (540 patients, 78Â·8 per cent) versus late (145, 21Â·2 per cent) recurrence was defined as 24â€‰months. Patients with early recurrence had extrahepatic disease more often (44Â·1 per cent versus 28Â·3 per cent in those with late recurrence; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001), whereas late recurrence was more often only intrahepatic (71Â·7 per cent versus 55Â·9 per cent for early recurrence; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). From time of recurrence, overall survival was worse among patients who had early versus late recurrence (median 10 versus 18â€‰months respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·029). In multivariable analysis, tumour characteristics including tumour size, number of lesions and satellite lesions were associated with an increased risk of early intrahepatic recurrence. In contrast, only the presence of liver cirrhosis was independently associated with an increased likelihood of late intrahepatic recurrence (hazard ratio 1Â·99, 95 per cent c.i. 1Â·11 to 3Â·56; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·019).


CONCLUSION

Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations are the most important factors in determining response to chemotherapy as well as long-term outcome, but beyond prognostication are potential therapeutic targets. Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AML, facilitated by next-generation sequencing, has spurred the development of new compounds in the treatment of AML, particularly the creation of small molecules that target the disease on a molecular level. Various new agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal or bispecific T-cell engager antibodies, metabolic and pro-apoptotic agents are currently investigated within clinical trials.

Smoke-free laws reduce disease prevalence. The impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky was examined. The authors hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of smoke-free laws.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of 83,727 Kentucky residents agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50 years who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 1995 to 2014. In 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free laws. County-level characteristics included adult smoking rate, sex, race/ethnicity, income, physician supply, observed radon values, and rurality.


RESULTS
Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The difference in lung cancer incidence between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws did not confer the same benefit. One hundred percent smoke-free laws, covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions, may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.

617,"Our contribution assesses the role of information barriers for patterns of participation in Higher Education (HE) and the related social inequalities. For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62 Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs, economic returns and chances of success of investments in different tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect varied substantially by parental social class and level of education. The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates increased their participation in more rewarding university fields. Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects. Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.",England,The British journal of sociology,29193014,2017,Information barriers and social stratification in higher education: evidence from a field experiment.,y

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may require systemic therapy. Ciclosporin A (CsA) is a widely-used, potent immunosuppressant for AD. CsA is not effective in all patients, and side effects limit its use. Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin (IL)-4 receptor-alpha monoclonal antibody, inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2/Th2-mediated inflammation, and is approved in the U.S.A. and the E.U. for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) in adults with AD with inadequate response to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA was medically inadvisable.


METHODS
In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw):every two weeks (q2w):placebo. All received concomitant medium-potency TCS from Week -2 through Week 16; dosage could be tapered if lesions cleared, or stopped for adverse reactions to TCS.


RESULTS
390 patients were screened; 325 were randomized and 318 completed the trial. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. Significantly more patients on dupilumab qw+TCS/q2w+TCS achieved â‰¥75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index at Week 16 vs placebo+TCS (primary endpoint) (59.1%/62.6% vs 29.6%; P<0.0001 vs placebo+TCS, both doses). Dupilumab qw+TCS/q2w+TCS significantly improved other clinical outcomes and AD symptoms, including pruritus, pain, sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life (QOL). Treatment groups had similar overall rates of adverse events (69.1%/72.0%/69.4%; qw+TCS/q2w+TCS/placebo+TCS) and serious adverse events (1.8%/1.9%/1.9%). Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab+TCS; skin infections were more frequent with placebo+TCS.


CONCLUSIONS
Dupilumab+TCS significantly improved signs and symptoms of AD and QOL in adults with history of inadequate response to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable.

621,"To study if obesity is a risk factor in elderly patients (>60Â years) with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, the outcomes of 576 elderly patients treated with rituximab in the RICOVER-60 trial were analysed in a retrospective study with regard to body mass index (BMI) and gender. Of the 576 patients, 1% had low body weight (BMIÂ <Â 18Â·5), 38% were normal weight (18Â·5Â â‰¤Â BMIÂ <Â 25), 42% were overweight (25Â â‰¤Â BMIÂ <Â 30) and 19% were obese (BMIÂ â‰¥Â 30).

EFS (PÂ =Â 0Â·041), PFS (PÂ =Â 0Â·038) and OS (PÂ =Â 0Â·031) were significantly better for female non-obese patients. A multivariate analysis adjusted for International Prognostic Index risk factors confirmed these results, with the following hazard ratios (HR) for obesity (BMIÂ â‰¥Â 30) for EFS/PFS/OS: all patients - 1Â·4/1Â·4/1Â·4 (not significant); male patients - 1Â·2/1Â·2/1Â·0 (not significant) and female patients - 1Â·7 (PÂ =Â 0Â·032)/1Â·9 (PÂ =Â 0Â·022)/2Â·0 (PÂ =Â 0Â·017).

625,"BACKGROUND
The aim of this study was to monitor the effect of humidified-warm carbon dioxide (HWCO2 ) delivered into the open abdomen of mice, simulating laparotomy.


METHODS
Mice were anaesthetized, ventilated and subjected to an abdominal incision followed by wound retraction. In the experimental group, a diffuser device was used to deliver HWCO2 ; the control group was exposed to passive air flow. In each group of mice, surgical damage was produced on one side of the peritoneal wall. Vital signs and core temperature were monitored throughout the 1-h procedure. The peritoneum was closed and mice were allowed to recover for 24â€‰h or 10â€‰days. Tumour cells were delivered into half of the mice in each cohort. Tissue was then examined using scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Passive air flow generated ultrastructural damage including mesothelial cell bulging/retraction and loss of microvilli, as assessed at 24â€‰h. Evidence of surgical damage was still measurable on day 10. HWCO2 maintained normothermia, whereas open surgery alone led to hypothermia. The degree of tissue damage was significantly reduced by HWCO2 compared with that in controls. Peritoneal expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± and vascular endothelial growth factor A was lowered by HWCO2 . These effects were also evident at the surgical damage sites, where protection from tissue trauma extended to 10â€‰days. HWCO2 did not reduce tumorigenesis in surgically damaged sites compared with passive air flow.


CONCLUSION
HWCO2 diffusion into the abdomen in the context of open surgery afforded tissue protection and accelerated tissue repair in mice, while preserving normothermia. Surgical relevance Damage to the peritoneum always occurs during open abdominal surgery, by exposure to desiccating air and by mechanical trauma/damage owing to the surgical intervention. Previous experimental studies showed that humidified-warm carbon dioxide (HWCO2 ) reduced peritoneal damage during laparoscopic insufflation. Additionally, this intervention decreased experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis compared with the use of conventional dry-cold carbon dioxide. In the present experimental study, the simple delivery of HWCO2 into the open abdomen reduced the amount of cellular damage and inflammation, and accelerated tissue repair. Sites of surgical intervention serve as ideal locations for cancer cell adhesion and subsequent tumour formation, but this was not changed measurably by the delivery of HWCO2 .",England,The British journal of surgery,29193022,2017,Experimental study of delivery of humidified-warm carbon dioxide during open abdominal surgery.,n

An impaired expression of Î±-defensins (Î±-Defs) in the ileal mucosa and, conversely, increased levels in plasma, have been reported in Crohn's disease (CD). However, the specificity and correlation of these findings with the degree of inflammation are unclear. We aimed to characterize the concentration and utility of ileal and plasma Î±-Defs in CD and to analyze a potential epigenetic mechanism of Î±-Def expression.


METHODS
Peripheral blood samples and ileal biopsies were obtained from patients at disease onset (aCD), from those who achieved remission (iCD), and from 2 control groups (healthy controls and non-CD-etiology ileitis patients). Plasma Î±-Defs 1-3 and 4 were detected by ELISA; Î±-Def 5 by immunolocalization. Methylation analysis of the Î±-Def 5 gene was performed using the MassARRAY EpiTYPER system.


RESULTS
Plasma Î±-Defs 1-3 concentrations were significantly higher in aCD with ileal involvement (L1, L3) vs iCD or the control groups. The Î±-Defs 1-3 concentrations were also similar to healthy controls in patients with non-CD ileitis. There was a significant positive correlation between plasma Î±-Defs 1-3 levels in aCD and the endoscopic index, as well as with CRP levels. The immunopositivity scoring showed significantly reduced Î±-Def 5 expression in ileal inflamed (aCD) vs non-inflamed mucosa (iCD and healthy controls). The Î±-Def 5 gene showed a higher methylation status in CD patients than controls, regardless of the inflammation.

627,"The composition of crude oil in a surficial aquifer was determined in two locations at the Bemidji, MN, spill site. The abundances of 71 individual hydrocarbons varied within 16 locations sampled. Little depletion of these hydrocarbons (relative to the pipeline oil) occurred in the first 10â€‰years after the spill, whereas losses of 25% to 85% of the total measured hydrocarbons occurred after 30â€‰years. The C6-30 n-alkanes, toluene, and o-xylene were the most depleted hydrocarbons. Some hydrocarbons, such as the n-C10-24 cyclohexanes, tri- and tetra- methylbenzenes, acyclic isoprenoids, and naphthalenes were the least depleted. Benzene was detected at every sampling location 30â€‰years after the spill. Degradation of the oil led to increases in the percent organic carbon and in the Î´Â 13 C of the oil. Another method of determining hydrocarbon loss was by normalizing the total measured hydrocarbon concentrations to that of the most conservative analytes. This method indicated that the total measured hydrocarbons were depleted by 47% to 77% and loss of the oil mass over 30â€‰years was 18% to 31%. Differences in hydrocarbon depletion were related to the depth of the oil in the aquifer, local topography, amount of recharge reaching the oil, availability of electron acceptors, and the presence of less permeable soils above the oil.

This study implements the network theory to study the hydrological connectivity between a group of 11 cenotes within the RC. Eight electrical resistivity tomography transects were used as an empirical basis. Each transect was acquired directly in the field using the SuperSting R1/IP equipment with a dipole-dipole configuration. An adapted version of the reliability algorithm for communication networks was used as a theoretical model. We found evidence of the existence of water cavities in the study area. We made a network from the data and assigned connection probabilities among cenotes as a function of the separation length and the number of water cavities, as well as their size.",United States,Ground water,29193028,2017,Connectivity in a Karst System Using Electrical Resistivity Tomography and Network Theory.,n
632,"The major Î²-haemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease and Î²-thalassaemia, represent the most common monogenic disorders worldwide and a steadily increasing global disease burden. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the only curative therapy, is only applied to a small minority of patients. Common clinical management strategies act mainly downstream of the root causes of disease. The observation that elevated fetal haemoglobin expression ameliorates these disorders has motivated longstanding investigations into the mechanisms of haemoglobin switching. Landmark studies over the last decade have led to the identification of two potent transcriptional repressors of Î³-globin, BCL11A and ZBTB7A. These regulators act with additional trans-acting epigenetic repressive complexes, lineage-defining factors and developmental programs to silence fetal haemoglobin by working on cis-acting sequences at the globin gene loci. Rapidly advancing genetic technology is enabling researchers to probe deeply the interplay between the molecular players required for Î³-globin (HBG1/HBG2) silencing. Gene therapies may enable permanent cures with autologous modified haematopoietic stem cells that generate persistent fetal haemoglobin expression.

633,"In ovo, late-stage chick embryos repetitively step spontaneously, a locomotor-related behavior also identified as repetitive limb movement (RLM). During RLMs, there is a flexor bias in recruitment and drive of leg muscle activity. The flexor biased activity occurs as embryos assume an extremely flexed posture in a spatially restrictive environment 2-3 days before hatching. We hypothesized that muscle afferent feedback under normal mechanical constraint is a significant input to the flexor bias observed during RLMs on embryonic day (E) 20. To test this hypothesis, muscle afference was altered either by performing a tenotomy of ankle muscles or removing the shell wall restricting leg movement at E20. Results indicated that neither ankle muscle tenotomy nor unilateral release of limb constraint by shell removal altered parameters indicative of flexor bias. We conclude that ankle muscle afference is not essential to ankle flexor bias characteristic of RLMs under normal postural conditions at E20.",United States,Developmental psychobiology,29193030,2017,Ankle muscle tenotomy does not alter ankle flexor muscle recruitment bias during locomotor-related repetitive limb movement in late-stage chick embryos.,n

To examine the diagnostic ability of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <36wks postmenstrual age) to detect later adverse motor outcomes or cerebral palsy (CP) in infants born preterm.


METHOD
Studies of infants born preterm with MRI earlier than 36 weeks postmenstrual age and quantitative motor data or a diagnosis of CP at or beyond 1 year corrected age were identified. Study details were extracted and meta-analyses performed where possible. Quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 (a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies).


RESULTS
Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which reported diagnostic accuracy and five reported data sufficient for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. Early structural MRI global scores detected a later diagnosis of CP with a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86-100) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 59-100). Global structural MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 44-100) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 90-100). White matter scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 20-48) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 78-88).


INTERPRETATION
Early structural MRI has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine adverse motor outcomes and CP in infants born preterm. Greater reporting of diagnostic accuracy in studies examining relationships with motor outcomes and CP is required to facilitate clinical utility of early MRI.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine later adverse motor outcomes and cerebral palsy (CP). Detection of infants who progressed to CP was stronger than motor outcomes. Global MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes more accurately than white matter scores. Few studies report diagnostic accuracy of early MRI findings.

636,"Many anticancer drugs target epidermal growth factor receptors to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases and tumor growth. Here, we show that an ErbB2-targeting pro-necrotic peptide (KWSY:MTD) selectively kills tumor cells expressing ErbB2 in vitro. An antibody against ErbB2 inhibits KWSY:MTD-induced cell death. KWSY:MTD causes membrane permeability which allows propidium iodide entry into the cytosol and the release of HMGB1 into the media, indicative of necrosis. Mitochondrial swelling occurs in response to KWSY:MTD. Moreover, in vivo analysis using a mouse model shows that KWSY:MTD partially suppressed growth in tumor tissue bearing ErbB2-expressing cells, but did not have obvious toxicity in mouse liver or kidney tissue. Taken together, KWSY:MTD has potential as an ErbB2-targeting anticancer drug. This article is protected by copyright.

To-date only 14 families from various ethnic groups have been reported. Here, we describe 10 patients from 7 unrelated Egyptian families with HMDPC. Markedly elevated blood Mn levels, the characteristic basal ganglia hyperintensity on T1W images, and variable degrees of extrapyramidal manifestations with or without liver disease were cardinal features in all patients. Eight patients presented with striking early diseased onset (<2 years). Unexpectedly, early hepatic involvement before the neurological regression was noted in 3 patients.

639,"CXCL4 regulates multiple facets of the immune response and is highly upregulated in various Th17-associated rheumatic diseases. However, whether CXCL4 plays a direct role in the induction of IL-17 production by human CD4 T cells is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CXCL4 induced human CD4 T cells to secrete IL-17 that co-expressed IFNÎ³ and IL-22, and differentiated naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells to become Th17-cytokine producing cells. In a co-culture system of human CD4 T cells with monocytes or myeloid dendritic cells, CXCL4 induced IL-17 production upon triggering by superantigen. Moreover, when monocyte-derived dendritic cells were differentiated in the presence of CXCL4, they orchestrated increased levels of IL-17, IFNÎ³, and proliferation by CD4 T cells. Furthermore, the CXCL4 levels in synovial fluid from psoriatic arthritis patients strongly correlated with IL-17 and IL-22 levels. A similar response to CXCL4 of enhanced IL-17 production by CD4 T cells was also observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Altogether, we demonstrate that CXCL4 boosts pro-inflammatory cytokine production especially IL-17 by human CD4 T cells, either by acting directly or indirectly via myeloid antigen presenting cells, implicating a role for CXCL4 in PsA pathology.

To examine the factors contributing to nurses choosing to exit the nursing profession before retirement age.


BACKGROUND
Population growth, ageing and growing demand for health services mean increased demand for nurses. Better retention could help meet this demand, yet little work has been done in New Zealand to understand early attrition.


METHODS
An online survey of registered and enrolled nurses and nurse practitioners who had left nursing was used. This study reports analysis of responses from 285 ex-nurses aged under 55.


FINDINGS
The primary reasons nurses left the profession were as follows: workplace concerns; personal challenges; career factors; family reasons; lack of confidence; leaving for overseas; unwillingness to complete educational requirements; poor work-life balance; and inability to find suitable nursing work. Most nurses discussed their intentions to leave with a family member or manager and most reported gaining transferrable skills through nursing.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses leave for many reasons. Implementing positive practice environments and individualized approaches to retaining staff may help reduce this attrition. Generational changes in the nature of work and careers mean that nurses may continue to leave the profession sooner than anticipated by policymakers.


IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
If the nursing workforce is to be able to meet projected need, education, recruitment and retention policies must urgently address issues leading to early attrition. In particular, policies improving the wider environmental context of nursing practice and ensuring that working environments are safe and nurses are well supported must be developed and implemented. Equally, national nursing workforce planning must take into account that nursing is no longer viewed as a career for life.",England,International nursing review,29193041,2017,Early nurse attrition in New Zealand and associated policy implications.,y

646,"OBJECTIVE
Acute postinjury negative affect (NA) may contribute to headache pain following physical injury. Early psychiatric-headache comorbidity conveys increased vulnerability to chronic headache-related disability and impairment. Yet, it is unknown whether NA is involved in the transition to chronic headache related-disability after injury. This prospective observational study examined the role of acute postinjury NA on subacute and chronic headache-related disability above and beyond nonpsychiatric factors.


METHODS
Eighty adult survivors of single-incident traumatic physical injury were assessed for negative affect (NA): a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSS) during the acute 2-week postinjury phase. NA was examined as the primary predictor of subacute (6-week) and chronic (3-month) headache-related disability; secondary analyses examined whether the individual NA components differentially impacted the outcomes.


RESULTS
Hierarchical linear regression confirmed NA as a unique predictor of subacute (Cohen's fâ€‰2 â€‰=â€‰0.130; Pâ€‰=â€‰.005) and chronic headache related-disability (Cohen's fâ€‰2 â€‰=â€‰0.160; Pâ€‰=â€‰.004) beyond demographic and injury-related factors (sex, prior headaches, and closed head injury). Upon further analysis, PTSS uniquely predicted greater subacute (Cohen's fâ€‰2 â€‰=â€‰0.105; Pâ€‰=â€‰.012) and chronic headache-related disability (Cohen's fâ€‰2 â€‰=â€‰0.103; Pâ€‰=â€‰.022) above and beyond demographic and injury-related factors, depression, and anxiety. Avoidance was a robust predictor of subacute headache impairment (explaining 15% of the variance) and hyperarousal was a robust predictor of chronic headache impairment (10% of the variance).


CONCLUSION
Although NA consistently predicted headache-related disability, PTSS alone was a unique predictor above and beyond nonpsychiatric factors, depression, and anxiety. These results are suggestive that early treatment of acute postinjury PTSS may correlate with reductions in disability and negative physical health sequelae associated with PTSS and chronic headache.",United States,Headache,29193043,2017,The Role of Negative Affect on Headache-Related Disability Following Traumatic Physical Injury.,n
647,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic sleep deficiency is associated with early mortality. In the epileptic population, there is a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, and individuals with severe refractory epilepsy are at greater risk of premature mortality than the general population. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affects 1:1000 cases of epilepsy each year. Ketogenic diet (KD) treatment is one of the few effective options for refractory seizures. Despite KD reducing seizures and increasing longevity in Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, they still succumb to sudden death. This study aims to determine whether (1) the rest profiles of KO and KD-treated KO (KOKD) mice resemble each other as a function of either age or proximity to death and (2) the timing of death correlates with acute or chronic changes in rest.


METHODS
Noninvasive actimetry was used to monitor rest throughout the lives of KO and wild-type (WT) littermates administered standard diet or KD.


RESULTS
As KO mice age, rest is reduced (PÂ <Â .0001). Rest is significantlyÂ improved in KDKO mice (PÂ <Â .0001), resembling WT values at several ages. When age is removed as a variable and data are realigned to the day of death, the rest profiles of KO and KOKD groups worsen to similar degrees as a function of proximity to death. The amount of rest acutely is not sensitive to the timing of death, whereas chronic rest deficiency profiles (10-15Â days prior to death) of both groups were indistinguishable. Chronic accumulation of rest deficiency over the final 15Â days was associated with 75% of deaths.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our data suggest that the accumulated rest deficiency is associated with sudden death in Kv1.1 KO mice. These data (1) support the proposed clinical hypothesis that chronic sleep deficiency may be associated with early mortality in epileptic patients and (2) warrant future preclinical and clinical studies on sleep monitoring in epileptic patients.",United States,Epilepsia,29193044,2017,"Accumulation of rest deficiency precedes sudden death of epileptic Kv1.1 knockout mice, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",y

To address this question, we investigated the association of BC risk with measures of adiposity, including body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), in a large cohort of Asian women. We used a nationwide cohort of adult Korean women selected from the National Health Insurance Corporation database merged with national health examination data from 2009 to 2015. A total of 11,227,948 women were tracked to retrospectively identify incident cases of BC. Our analysis used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and assess the association of BC risk with BMI and/or WC in both pre- and postmenopausal women. BMI and WC were robustly associated with increased risk for postmenopausal BC (Ptrend <0.001 for both BMI and WC) but not with premenopausal BC. Association between WC and premenopausal BC was only statistically significant when considering BMI (Ptrend =0.044). In contrast, postmenopausal BC was negatively associated with WC when considering BMI (Ptrend =0.011). In premenopausal women, WC may predict increased BC risk when considering BMI. However, in postmenopausal women, WC is not superior to BMI as an indicator of BC risk. This article is protected by copyright.

650,"The Ardebil plain, which is located in northwest Iran, has been faced with a recent and severe decline in groundwater level caused by a decrease of precipitation, successive long-term droughts, and overexploitation of groundwater for irrigating the farmlands. Predictions of groundwater levels can help planners to deal with persistent water deficiencies. In this study, the support vector regression (SVR) and M5 decision tree models were used to predict the groundwater level in Ardebil plain. The monthly groundwater level data from 24 piezometers for a 17-year period (1997 to 2013) were used for training and test of models.

653,"OBJECTIVE
Using a ""double-pulse"" adaptation paradigm, in which two stimuli are presented in quick succession, this study examines the neural mechanisms underlying potentiation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in visual snow syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous ""double-pulse"" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.


METHODS
We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.


RESULTS
In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",United States,Headache,29193050,2017,Antagonistic Relationship Between VEP Potentiation and Gamma Power in Visual Snow Syndrome.,y

Epidemiological data were collected, and serum HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody were measured. Unconditional logistic regression was used to examine association and potential interaction, while semi-Bayes method was employed to make estimates more conservative. The prevalence of serum HBsAg positivity was 43.2% among cases and 6.5% among controls. The adjusted odds ratio for ever smoking was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.33 - 1.96) among male and was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.53-1.26) among female. Age at first cigarette, duration of smoking and pack-years of smoking were all significantly associated with liver cancer among men.

655,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies show migraineurs are at an increased risk of developing suicidal behaviors, even after controlling for comorbid depression. However, previous research has not examined the impact of psychiatric mood disorders on suicidal behaviors in migraineurs within a nationally representative sample.


OBJECTIVE
A cross-sectional study was used to investigate the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors and determine whether psychiatric comorbidities modify this association in a nationwide inpatient cohort.


METHODS
We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations compiled from USA billing data. Migraine, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric disorders were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes from hospitalization discharges (2007-2012). Weighted national estimates were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
156,172,826 hospitalizations were included, of which 1.4% had a migraine diagnosis and 1.6% had a diagnosis of suicidal behavior. Migraineurs had a 2.07-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.96-2.19) compared with non-migraineurs. We repeated analyses after stratifying by depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among hospitalizations with depression, migraine was associated with a 20% reduced odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 0.76-0.85). Among hospitalizations without depression, migraine was associated with 2.35-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 2.20-2.51). In stratified analyses, we noted that among hospitalizations with anxiety, migraineurs had slightly increased odds of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.13). Among hospitalizations without anxiety, migraine was associated with a 2.06-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.94-2.20). Similarly, in analyses stratified by PTSD, migraine was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94-1.07) among those with PTSD. However, the odds of suicidal behaviors were increased among hospitalizations without PTSD (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.84-2.08).


CONCLUSION

The chronic and progressive nature of diabetes is usually associated with micro- and macrovascular complications where failure of pancreatic Î²-cell function and a general condition of hyperglycaemia is created. One possible factor is failure of the patient to comply with and adhere to the prescribed insulin due to the inconvenient administration route. This review summarizes the rationale for oral insulin administration, existing barriers and some counter-strategies trialled.


KEY FINDINGS
Oral insulin mimics the physiology of endogenous insulin secreted by pancreas. Following the intestinal absorption of oral insulin, it reaches the liver at high concentration via the portal vein. Oral insulin on the other hand has the potential to protect pancreatic Î²-cells from autoimmune destruction. Structural modification, targeting a particular tissue/receptor, and the use of innovative pharmaceutical formulations such as nanoparticles represent strategies introduced to improve oral insulin bioavailability. They showed promising results in overcoming the hurdles facing oral insulin delivery, although delivery is far from ideal.


SUMMARY
The use of advanced pharmaceutical technologies and further research in particulate carrier system delivery predominantly nanoparticle utilization would offer useful tools in delivering insulin via the oral route which in turn would potentially improve diabetic patient compliance to insulin and the overall management of diabetes.",England,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,29193053,2017,Oral insulin delivery: existing barriers and current counter-strategies.,n
658,"Variation in the shape of the human face and in stature is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental influences. One such environmental influence is malnourishment, which can result in growth faltering, usually diagnosed by means of comparing an individual's stature with a set of age-appropriate standards. These standards for stature, however, are typically ascertained in groups where people are at low risk for growth faltering. Moreover, genetic differences among populations with respect to stature are well established, further complicating the generalizability of stature-based diagnostic tools. In a large sample of children aged 5-19 years, we obtained high-resolution genomic data, anthropometric measures and 3D facial images from individuals within and around the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. With genome-wide complex trait analysis, we partitioned genetic and environmental variance for growth outcomes and facial shape. We found that children with growth faltering have faces that look like those of older and taller children, in a direction opposite to the expected allometric trajectory, and in ways predicted by the environmental portion of covariance at the community and individual levels. The environmental variance for facial shape varied subtly but significantly among communities, whereas genetic differences were minimal. These results reveal that facial shape preserves information about exposure to undernourishment, with important implications for refining assessments of nutritional status in children and the developmental-genetics of craniofacial variation alike.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193055,2017,Facial shape manifestations of growth faltering in Tanzanian children.,y

To search for novel fusion genes, we obtained RNA-seq data from TGS-01 human glioma-initiating cells, and identified a novel fusion gene (HMGA2-EGFR), encoding a protein comprising the N-terminal region of the high mobility group AT hook protein 2 (HMGA2) fused to the C-terminal region of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which retained the transmembrane and kinase domains of the EGFR. This fusion gene product showed transforming potential and a high tumor-forming capacity in cell culture and in vivo. Mechanistically, HMGA2-EGFR constitutively induced a higher level of phosphorylated STAT5B than EGFRvIII, an in-frame exon deletion product of the EGFR gene that is commonly found in primary glioblastoma. Forced expression of HMGA2-EGFR enhanced orthotopic tumor formation of the U87MG human glioma cell line. Furthermore, the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib blocked sphere formation of TGS-01 cells in culture and inhibited tumor formation in vivo. These findings suggest that, in addition to gene amplification and in-frame exon deletion, EGFR signaling can also be activated by gene fusion, suggesting a possible avenue for treatment of glioblastoma.

660,"Approximately 50% of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) do not obtain chromosomal abnormalities as an effective risk-stratification, and present cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). In order to develop a reliable prediction model for stratifying the risk of these elderly patients, we conducted a study with a discovery and validation design. As a result, we found the top 6 mutated genes in the discovery cohort of 26 case by the whole exome sequencing, and verified as recurrent mutations in the large cohort of 329 patients by sanger sequencing. The top 6 genes were NPM1, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, CEBPA double allele, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and the frequency of each gene in the combining cohort was 36.8%, 19.8%, 20.1%, 5.8%, 14.9% and 22.5%, respectively. Additionally, clinical variables such as age, white blood cell counts, genes of IDH1 and DNMT3A mutations, European LeukemiaNet genotype (NPM1 mutations and lacking FLT3-ITD or CEBPA double allele mutations) and treatment protocols were independent factors for predicting the probabilities of overall and event-free survival. The prediction nomograms based on these significant factors showed accurate discrimination.

661,"OBJECTIVE
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive change resulting from challenging life events. The current study examined factors associated with PTG in traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.


METHOD
Participants (NÂ =Â 221) in this prospective cohort study included adults admitted to a Level I trauma center. Over half the participants (60%) were male, with a mean age of 47. Participants completed baseline measures during hospitalization. PTG was assessed at 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Greater PTG was associated with minority race/ethnicity, lower income, automotive collision, and premorbid psychological disorder other than depression or posttraumatic stress (PTS). These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients. Analysis confirmed that greater PTS at follow-up was associated with more growth.


CONCLUSION
Participants with the most growth also experienced the most distress. This finding demonstrates the importance of implementing psychological screening and intervention for trauma patients in the acute care setting to reduce PTS and facilitate growth.",United States,Journal of clinical psychology,29193058,2017,Posttraumatic growth in a heterogeneous sample of traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.,y
662,"The adolescent brain is vulnerable to long-lasting cognitive disturbances resulting from nicotine exposure. Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED) and high- (HE), moderate- (ME) and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30 min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with Î±7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical Î±7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

There has been sparse research on the generalized conditioned properties of token reinforcement. We evaluated leisure items, edible items, and tokens using a progressive ratio schedule with three children with diagnoses of ASD and developmental delays. The highest break points occurred during the token reinforcement condition for two out of three participants, but response rates tended to be higher with edibles. We then evaluated the effects of presession access to edibles on the break points of edible items and tokens with two participants. Break points decreased only in the edible reinforcement condition, and the participants chose to work for leisure items rather than edibles when presession access to edibles was in place.

In a pair of studies, we have corroborated that merely expressing attitudes towards the Jewish minority affects people's relevant behaviour towards this group. In an Internet study, participants who first completed verbal attitude measures were more likely to donate to a Jewish organisation compared to those who completed the measures after making the decision to donate. Moreover, responses to attitude measures of various types and donating to the Jewish organisation were correlated when attitudes had been expressed in the first step. When attitudes were measured after the decision to donate, only the responses to the traditional anti-Semitic scale were correlated with this behaviour. In the field study, in which the time interval between attitude and behaviour measures was introduced, no question-behaviour effect was observed.

666,"Characteristics of death attributed solely to methamphetamine toxicity (MT, n = 93) by forensic pathologists were examined and compared to cases of multiple drug toxicity (MDT, n = 634). The mean age of MT cases was 36.7 years, and 86.0% were male. Strenuous activity was reported in 12.9%. The most common witness observations were: collapse (60.3%), difficulty in breathing (36.2%), and hyperthermia (27.6%).

Nonmetric traits, however, continue to be valuable tools in identifying remains in forensic investigations. In this study, geometric morphometric analyses of cranial outlines were performed to quantitatively assess population and sex variation in modern human cranial shapes and to verify group differences in previously reported qualitative traits. Elliptical Fourier analysis was conducted on two-dimensional images of the left lateral, posterior, and superior cranial views from 198 U.S. Black and White crania. Results reveal significant sex and population differences in cranial shape that generally coincide with traditional qualitative descriptions. Although sex classification was relatively low (70.2%), ancestry classification was higher (92.4%), indicating that outline analyses that incorporate multiple nonmetric traits into a single statistical analysis may provide a more objective and accurate means of ancestry classification.",United States,Journal of forensic sciences,29193064,2017,A Morphometric Outline Analysis of Ancestry and Sex Differences in Cranial Shape.,n
668,"More frequent utilization of non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) organs for lung transplantation has the potential to relieve the shortage of donor organs. In particular with respect to uncontrolled NHBD, concerns exist regarding the risk of ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury-related graft damage or dysfunction. Due to their immunomodulating and tissue-remodelling properties, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suspected of playing a beneficial role regarding short- and long-term survival and function of the allograft. Thus, MSC administration might represent a promising pretreatment strategy for NHBD organs. To study the initial effects of warm ischaemia and MSC application, a large animal lung transplantation model was generated, and the structural organ composition of the transplanted lungs was analysed stereologically with particular respect to the blood-gas barrier and the surfactant system. In this study, porcine lungs (nâ€…=â€…5/group) were analysed. Group 1 was the sham-operated control group. In pigs of groups 2-4, cardiac arrest was induced, followed by a period of 3â€…h of ventilated ischaemia at room temperature. In groups 3 and 4, 50â€…Ã—â€…106 MSCs were administered intravascularly via the pulmonary artery and endobronchially, respectively, during the last 10â€…min of ischaemia. The left lungs were transplanted, followed by a reperfusion period of 4â€…h. Then, lungs were perfusion-fixed and processed for light and electron microscopy. Samples were analysed stereologically for IR injury-related structural parameters, including volume densities and absolute volumes of parenchyma components, alveolar septum components, intra-alveolar oedema, and the intracellular and intra-alveolar surfactant pool. Additionally, the volume-weighted mean volume of lamellar bodies (lbs) and their profile size distribution were determined. Three hours of ventilated warm ischaemia was tolerated without eliciting histological or ultrastructural signs of IR injury, as revealed by qualitative and quantitative assessment. However, warm ischaemia influenced the surfactant system.

This was due to a lower number of large lb profiles (size classes 5-15). In contrast, the intra-alveolar surfactant system was not altered significantly.

670,"Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease affecting millions of individuals. Kainate receptors (KARs),especially kainate-type of ionotropic glutamate receptor 2 (GluK2), play an important role in epileptogenesis. Recent data showed GluK2 could undergo post-translational modifications in terms of S-nitrosylation (SNO), and affect the signaling pathway of cell death in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. However, it is unclear whether S-nitrosylation of GluK2 (SNO-GluK2) contributes to cell death induced by epilepsy. Here we report that kainic acid (KA)-induced SNO-GluK2 is mediated by GluK2 itself, regulated by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the level of cytoplasmic calcium in vivo and in vitro hippocampus neurons. The whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed the influence of SNO-GluK2 on ion channel characterization of GluK2-KARs. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining results showed that inhibition of SNO-GluK2 by blocking nNOS or GluK2 or by reducing the level of cytoplasmic calcium protected hippocampal neurons from KA-induced injury. Finally, Immunoprecipitation and western blotting data revealed the involvement of assembly of a GluK2-PSD95-nNOS signaling complex in epilepsy. Taken together, our results showed the SNO-GluK2 plays an important role in neuronal injury of epileptic rats by forming GluK2-PSD95-nNOS signaling module in a cytoplasmic calcium dependent way, suggesting a potential therapeutic target site for epilepsy.

671,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for periodontal diseases and may exacerbate the progression of the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) cause DM complications relative to levels of glycemic control and larger amounts accumulate in the periodontal tissues of patients with periodontitis and DM. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AGEs on the expression of inflammation-related factors in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) to elucidate the impact of AGEs on DM-associated periodontitis.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
HGFs were cultured with or without AGEs. Cell viability was examined, and RNA and protein fractions were isolated from AGE-treated cells. The expression of interleukin (IL)-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and the receptor for AGE (RAGE) was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reactive oxygen species activity was measured using a kit with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. Human monocytic cells (THP-1) labeled with a fluorescent reagent were co-cultured with HGFs treated with AGEs and IL-6 siRNA, and the adhesive activity of THP-1 cells to HGFs was assessed. The expression of IL-6 and ICAM-1 was examined when HGFs were pretreated with recombinant human IL-6, the siRNAs of RAGE and IL-6, and inhibitors of MAPK and NF-ÎºB, and then cultured with and without AGEs. The phosphorylation of MAPK and NF-ÎºB was assessed using western blotting.


RESULTS
AGEs increased the mRNA and protein expressions of RAGE, IL-6, ICAM-1 and reactive oxygen species activity in HGFs, and promoted the adhesion of THP-1 cells to HGFs, but had no effect on cell viability until 72Â hours. Recombinant human IL-6 increased ICAM-1 expression in HGFs, while the siRNAs of RAGE and IL-6 inhibited AGE-induced IL6 and ICAM1 mRNA expression, and IL-6 siRNA depressed AGE-induced THP-1 cell adhesion. AGEs increased the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAPKs, p65 NF-ÎºB and IÎºBÎ±, while inhibitors of p38, ERK MAPKs and NF-ÎºB significantly decreased AGE-induced IL-6 and ICAM-1 expression.


CONCLUSION
AGEs increase IL-6 and ICAM-1 expression via the RAGE, MAPK and NF-ÎºB pathways in HGFs and may exacerbate the progression of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",United States,Journal of periodontal research,29193068,2017,"Advanced glycation end-products increase IL-6 and ICAM-1 expression via RAGE, MAPK and NF-ÎºB pathways in human gingival fibroblasts.",n
672,"The American diet is lacking in plant-based foods and vegetables, higher in protein than necessary, and too centered on meat and poultry. Two major dietary shifts recommended by the 2015-2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines are to increase vegetable intake and to increase the variety of protein food sources. One suggested strategy for doing this is to partially replace meat and poultry with vegetables and plant-based ingredients in mixed dishes. This research tested the potential of flavor modalities (taste, aroma, trigeminal, and their combination) as strategies to increase the sensory appeal of plant-forward dishes. Consumer testing (n = 141) was conducted in a cross-sectional design in a laboratory setting on 24 recipe variations. Three factors were tested: cuisine (Latin American, Mediterranean, and Asian), meat proportion (high-meat/low-vegetable versus low-meat/high-vegetable), and flavor strategy (taste, aroma, trigeminal, and a reduced-intensity trimodal combination). Statistical analysis was performed in R and XLSTAT-SensoryÂ® 2017. Four consumer preference segments were uncovered. The low-meat dishes achieved parity or higher in consumer acceptance across all recipes and flavor strategies. The taste and trigeminal strategies both had higher overall acceptability scores than the aroma strategy, and the differences were significant (P < 0.05) in some consumer preference segments. The consumers successfully characterized the samples using a Check-All-That-Apply task, verifying the flavor strategy design. This research provides insight into consumer preferences regarding flavor strategies to partially replace meat with vegetables in mixed dishes. The trigeminal and trimodal combination strategies were found to be the most promising flavor modalities to use to implement this shift.


PRACTICAL APPLICATION
There is little knowledge of American consumer preferences regarding vegetables in mixed dishes. Mixed dishes are a strategy recommended by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to increase vegetable consumption and variety of protein sources. This research explores various flavor and culinary strategies with which to carry out the mixed dish meat-vegetable swap and to test the potential of the Flexitarian Flipâ„¢ (the shift from meat-centric to plant-centric diets). This research shows that individuals have different preferences regarding the type of flavor they prefer in mixed dishes (for example, some consumers prefer salty and some prefer spicy), so if the dietitian can recommend recipes that cater to that client's food and flavor preferences, the client will be more likely to adhere to their diet.",United States,Journal of food science,29193069,2017,The Flexitarian Flipâ„¢ : Testing the Modalities of Flavor as Sensory Strategies to Accomplish the Shift from Meat-Centered to Vegetable-Forward Mixed Dishes.,n
673,"Although several studies have been published regarding the morphology and anatomical variations of the human shoulder joint, most have dealt with adult individuals. Those looking into the development of the joint have been focused on specific structures or have observed specimens in advanced gestational stages. The goal of this paper is to perform a complete analysis of the embryonic and early fetal development of the elements in the shoulder joint, and to clarify some contradictory data in the literature. In our study, serial sections of 32 human embryos (Carnegie stages 16-23) and 26 fetuses (9-13Â weeks) were analyzed. The chondrogenic anlagen of the humerus and the medial border of the scapula can be observed from as early as Carnegie stage 17, whereas that of the rest of the scapula appears at stage 18. The osteogenic process begins in week 10 for the humeral head and week 11 for the scapula. At stage 19 the interzone becomes apparent, which will form the glenohumeral joint. In the next stage the glenohumeral joint will begin delaminating and exhibiting a looser central band. Denser lateral bands will join the humeral head (caput humeri) and the margins of the articular surface of the scapula, thus forming the glenoid labrum, which can be fully appreciated by stage 22. In 24-mm embryos (stage 21) we can observe, for the first time, the long head of the biceps tendon (which is already inserted in the glenoid labrum by week 9), and the intertubercular sulcus, whose depth is apparent since week 12. Regarding ligamentous structures, the coracohumeral ligament is observed at the end of Carnegie stage 23, whereas the primitive glenohumeral ligament already appeared in week 10. The results of this study provide a detailed description of the morphogenesis, origin and chronological order of appearance of the main intrinsic structures of the human shoulder joint during late embryonic and early fetal development. We expect these results to help explain several functional aspects of the shoulder joint, and to clarify some contradictory data in the literature regarding this complex anatomical and biomechanical structure, helping future researchers in their efforts.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193070,2017,Development of the human shoulder joint during the embryonic and early fetal stages: anatomical considerations for clinical practice.,n

Large differences were also observed for estimates of endurance swimming performance between these recirculating flumes and a free-surface swim tunnel. Differences in estimates of performance may be attributable to variation in flow conditions within different types of swim chambers.

677,"The level of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (PA), correlates with chronic inflammation in obese and metabolic syndrome patients. However, low level of vitamin D3 is observed in those conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of 1Î±,25(OH)2 D3 on PA-treated THP-1 cells. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measure mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-Î±, Interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, and chemokine IL-8 under PA and 1Î±,25(OH)2 D3 influence. PA, at all concentrations (25-100 Î¼M), enhanced LPS stimulatory effect on those mRNA expression compared to LPS-treated and -untreated cells. Combination with 1Î±,25(OH)2 D3 increased cytokine expression at high (10-6 M) and high-normal (10-8 M) concentrations compared to PA + LPS and LPS alone, both for 2 and 24 h. However, low-normal (10-10 M) and low (10-12 M) levels of 1Î±,25(OH)2 D3 could not enhance PA effect, but mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine was higher than LPS-treated cells. Upstream pathway of 1Î±,25(OH)2 D3 , which is cholecalciferol, also gave the similar result. Further, inhibition of calcium pathway does not play a role in this mechanism. Thus, these findings support pro-inflammatory effect of PA and vitamin D3 on innate immune response, especially on fat-induced inflammation.

679,"Auditory brainstem neurons are functionally primed to fire action potentials (APs) at markedly high-rates in order to rapidly encode acoustic information of sound. This specialization is critical for survival and the comprehension of behaviourally relevant communication functions, including sound localization and understanding speech in noise. Here, we investigated underlying ion channel mechanisms essential for high-rate AP firing in neurons of the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM) - the avian analog of bushy cells of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In addition to the established function of high-voltage activated potassium channels, we found that resurgent sodium current (INaR ) plays a role in regulating rapid firing activity of late-developing (embryonic [E] days 19-21) NM neurons. INaR of late-developing NM neurons showed similar properties with mammalian neurons in that its unique mechanism of an ""open channel block state"" facilitated the recovery and increased the availability of sodium (NaV ) channels after depolarization. Using a computational model of NM neurons, we demonstrated that removal of INaR reduced high-rate AP firing. We found weak INaR during a prehearing period (E11-12), which transformed to resemble late-developing INaR properties around hearing onset (E14-16). Anatomically, we detected strong NaV 1.6 expression near maturation, which became increasingly less distinct at hearing onset and prehearing periods, suggesting that multiple NaV channel subtypes may contribute to INaR during development. We conclude that INaR plays an important role in regulating rapid AP firing for NM neurons, a property that may be evolutionarily conserved for functions related to similar avian and mammalian hearing.

680,"OBJECTIVES
The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the differences in dissolution profiles of meloxicam tablets on the in-vivo bioavailability parameters after oral administration.


METHODS
Compare in-vitro dissolution testing in the recommended media to evaluate in-vivo bioequivalence outcomes for the Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class II weak acidic drugs. Nine Beagle dogs received a single oral administration of each formulation (7.5Â mg) in a three-way crossover design.


KEY FINDINGS
The dissolution of meloxicam from both test products showed marked differences with that from the reference tablet in pH 1.0, 4.5 and 6.8 media at 50 or 75Â rpm. Both formulations exhibiting slow or fast dissolution were then compared with the reference product for in-vivo bioequivalence study. Both products were bioequivalent with the reference tablet in either extent or rate of oral absorption. It indicated that the dissolution profiles which discriminated between the formulations inÂ vitro did not accurately predict the in-vivo bioequivalence outcomes.

Comparative dissolution profiles using similarity factor (f2 ) in the recommended media should be relaxed to fulfil the requirements for the development, scale-up and postapproval changes to immediate release oral solid dosage forms of meloxicam.",England,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,29193077,2017,Evaluating bioequivalence of meloxicam tablets: is in-vitro dissolution test overdiscriminating?,n
681,"Optogenetics has emerged as a potential alternative to electrotherapy for treating arrhythmia, but feasibility studies have been limited to ventricular defibrillation via epicardial light application. Here, we assess the efficacy of optogenetic atrial tachycardia (AT) termination in human hearts using a strategy that targets for illumination specific regions identified in an automated manner. In three patient-specific models reconstructed from late gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans, we simulated channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression via gene delivery. In all three models, we attempted to terminate reentrant AT (induced via rapid pacing) via optogenetic stimulation. We compared two strategies: (1) distributed illumination of the endocardium by multi-optrode grids (Nopt Â =Â 64, 128, 256) and (2) targeted illumination of the critical isthmus, which was identified via analysis of simulated activation patterns using an algorithm based on flow networks. The illuminated area and input power were smaller for the targeted approach (19-57.8Â mm2 ; 0.6-1.8Â W) compared to the sparsest distributed arrays (Nopt Â =Â 64; 124.9Â Â±Â 6.3Â mm2 ; 3.9Â Â±Â 0.2Â W). AT termination rates for distributed illumination were low, ranging from <5% for short pulses (1/10Â ms-long) to âˆ¼20% for longer stimuli (100/1000Â ms). When we attempted to terminate the same AT episodes with targeted illumination, outcomes were similar for short pulses (1/10Â ms-long: 0% success) but improved for longer stimuli (100Â ms: 54% success; 1000Â ms: 90% success). We conclude that simulations in patient-specific models show that light pulses lasting longer than the AT cycle length can efficiently and reliably terminate AT in atria light-sensitized via gene delivery. We show that targeted optogenetic stimulation based on analysis of AT morphology may be a reliable approach for defibrillation and requires less power than distributed illumination.

A logistic regression model was fit to the data from 2500 SAKs in order to determine the probability of obtaining at least one Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) eligible DNA profile based on a number of predictor variables. The probability of obtaining at least one CODIS eligible DNA profile from an SAK varied as a function of (i) days to kit collection following a sexual assault; (ii) years to kit submission to the laboratory for testing following kit collection; (iii) the age of the victim; and (iv) the occurrence of victim-reported consensual sex around the time of the assault and/or kit collection.

683,"Tan-67 is a selective non-peptidic Î´-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist that confers neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-caused neuronal injury in pre-treated animals. In this study, we examined whether post-ischemic administration of Tan-67 in stroke mice is also neuroprotective and whether the treatment affects expression, maturation and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). A focal cerebral I/R model in mice was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour (h) and Tan-67 (1.5,3 or 4.5 mg/kg) was administered via the tail vein at 1 h after reperfusion. Alternatively, naltrindole, a selective DOR antagonist (5 mg/kg), was administered 1 h before Tan-67 treatment. Our results showed that post-ischemic administration of Tan-67 (3 mg/kg or 4.5 mg/kg) was neuroprotective as shown by decreased infarct volume and neuronal loss following I/R. Importantly, Tan-67 improved animal survival and neurobehavioral outcomes. Conversely, naltrindole abolished Tan-67 neuroprotection in infarct volume. Tan-67 treatment also increased APP expression, maturation and processing in the ipsilateral penumbral area at 6 h but decreased APP expression and maturation in the same brain area at 24 h after I/R. Tan-67-induced increase of APP expression was also seen in the ischemic cortex at 24 h following I/R. Moreover, Tan-67 attenuated BACE-1 expression, Î²-secretase activity and the BACE cleavage of APP in the ischemic cortex at 24 h after I/R, which was abolished by naltrindole. Our data suggest that Tan-67 is a promising DOR-dependent therapeutic agent for treating I/R-caused disorder and that Tan-67-mediated neuroprotection may be mediated via modulating APP expression, maturation and processing, despite an uncertain causative relationship between the altered APP and the outcomes observed.

Fine-needle aspirates were collected from canine lymphoma, cutaneous mast cell tumour, anal gland adenocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma and oral malignant melanoma using nine different techniques.


RESULTS
There was a significant difference in cell yield between fine-needle aspirate techniques for melanoma, lymphoma and anal gland adenocarcinoma. The application of suction yielded the largest number of cells. Cell numbers in lymphoma and fibrosarcoma aspirates collected by different veterinary surgeons were not significantly different. Use of a smaller gauge needle and suction increased the quantity of RNA isolated from fibrosarcoma and anal gland adenocarcinoma aspirates, but did not influence RNA integrity.

686,"Traditional pathway analysis map single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to genes according to physical position, which lacks sufficient biological bases. Here we incorporated genetics of gene expression into gene and pathway based analysis to identify genes and pathways associated with lung cancer risk. We identified expression related SNPs (eSNPs) in lung tissues and integrated these eSNPs into three lung cancer genome wide association studies (GWASs), including 12,843 lung cancer cases and 12,639 controls. We used SKAT-C for gene-based analysis, and conditional analysis to identify independent eSNPs of each gene. ARTP algorithm was used for pathway analysis. A total of 374,382 eSNPs in the GWAS datasets survived quality control, which were mapped to 5,084 genes and 2,752 pathways. In the gene-based analysis, nine genes showed significant associations with lung cancer risk. Among them, TP63 (3q28), RP11-650L12.2 (15q25.1), and CHRNA5 (15q25.1) were located in known lung cancer susceptibility loci. We also validated two newly identified susceptibility loci (RNASET2 and AL133458.1 in 6q27, and MPZL3 in 11q23.3). Besides, DVL3 (3q27.1), RP11-522I20.3 (9q21.32), and CCDC116 (22q11.21) were identified as novel lung cancer susceptibility genes. Pathway analysis showed that pathways involved in protein structure, the Notch signaling pathway and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor related pathways were associated with lung cancer risk.

Elevated BNP is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes after noncardiac surgery. We assessed BNP values as markers of perioperative fluid status and their correlation with major/cardiopulmonary (CP) complications following CRSâ€‰+â€‰HIPEC.


METHODS
Fluid balance, BNP levels, and morbidity data were collected for all patients undergoing CRSâ€‰+â€‰HIPEC between 6/2014 and 2/2016.


RESULTS
One hundred and twenty-nine patients underwent CRSâ€‰+â€‰HIPEC for appendiceal adenocarcinoma (nâ€‰=â€‰99), mesothelioma (nâ€‰=â€‰16), and colon cancer (nâ€‰=â€‰14). Less than 10% had CP comorbidities. The median PCI was 14 (range 4-39); 89% underwent CC0/1 resection (nâ€‰=â€‰115). Median blood loss (EBL) was 497â€‰mL (50-2700). Major complications (Clavien III-V) occurred in 16 (12%), CP in 17 (13%), and major/CP in 24 (18%). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 2 (1.5%). Elevated BNP on POD1 correlated with increased risk of major/CP complications (OR 2.2, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.052). This was most pronounced in the 25 patients receiving cisplatin: for each 100 unit increase in POD1 BNP the OR for major/CP complication was 7.4 versus 1.2 for the remaining patients, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.083. Multivariate analysis identified increased EBL (OR 4.1 Pâ€‰=â€‰0.011) and a trend toward increased BNP on POD1 (OR for each 100 unit increase 2.0, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.10) as risk factors for major/CP complications.

This study aimed to explore the transfer rates of aflatoxins from several contaminated herbal medicines by fungi to their decoctions.


METHODS
Five types of commonly used herbal medicines including Lilii Bulbus, Hordei Fructus Germinatus, Nelumbinis Semen, Polygalae Radix and Bombyx Batryticatus were selected as the examples. Raw herbal medicine samples were treated by ultrasonication-assisted extraction with 70% methanol and immunoaffinity column clean-up, and the decoctions were prepared following the commonly used boiling method with water for 2 h. Then, the optimized high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) method was validated for the quantitative analysis of four aflatoxins (AFG2 , AFG1 , AFB2 and AFB1 ) after postcolumn photochemical derivatization, which was proved to be reliable and sensitive.


KEY FINDINGS
Aflatoxins were detected to be transferred from the herbal medicines to decoctions with significantly different transfer rates in the five types of herbal medicines. Quietly high transfer rates of 7.26-115.36% for AFG2 , 4.37-26.37% for AFB1 and 9.64-47.68% for AFB2 were obtained. AFB1 as the most toxic aflatoxin expressed the lowest transfer rate, but still exhibited high amount in the samples.

Therefore, the monitoring of aflatoxins in herbal medicines and their decoctions is in great urgency to ensure the security of consumers taking decoctions.",England,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,29193086,2017,Transfer rates of aflatoxins from herbal medicines to decoctions determined by an optimized high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method.,n
693,"Predators can impact ecosystems through consumptive or risk effects on prey. Physiologically, risk effects can be mediated by energetic mechanisms or stress responses. The predation-stress hypothesis predicts that risk induces stress in prey, which can affect survival and reproduction. However, empirical support for this hypothesis is both mixed and limited, and the conditions that cause predation risk to induce stress responses in some cases, but not others, remain unclear. Unusually clear-cut variation in exposure of Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) to predation risk from white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in the waters of Southwestern Africa provides an opportunity to test the predation-stress hypothesis in the wild. Here, we measured fecal glucocorticoid concentrations (fGCM) from Cape fur seals at six discrete islands colonies exposed to spatiotemporal variation in predation risk from white sharks over a period of three years. We found highly elevated fGCM concentrations in seals at colonies exposed to high levels of unpredictable and relatively uncontrollable risk of shark attack, but not at colonies where seals were either not exposed to shark predation or could proactively mitigate their risk through antipredatory behavior. Differences in measured fGCM levels were consistent with patterns of risk at the site and seasonal level, for both seal adults and juveniles. Seal fGCM levels were not correlated with colony population size, density, and geographic location. Investigation at a high risk site (False Bay) also revealed strong correlations between fGCM levels and temporal variation in shark attack rates, but not with shark relative abundance. Our results suggest that predation risk will induce a stress response when risk cannot be predicted and/or proactively mitigated by behavioral responses.",United States,Ecology,29193090,2017,Physiological stress responses to natural variation in predation risk: evidence from white sharks and seals.,n

Forty-eight, healthy lean (nÂ =Â 29) and obese (nÂ =Â 20) adults provided SCAT biopsies before and after six weeks of morning fasting (FAST; 0Â kcal until 1200Â h) or daily breakfast consumption (BFAST; â‰¥700Â kcal before 1100Â h). Biopsies were analysed for mRNA levels of selected genes, and GLUT4 and Akt protein content. Basal and insulin-stimulated Akt activation and tissue glucose uptake rates were also determined. In lean individuals, lipid turnover and insulin signalling genes (ACADM and IRS2) were upregulated with FAST versus BFAST [1.14 (95%CI: 0.97 to 1.30) versus 0.80 (95%CI: 0.64 to 0.96), PÂ =Â 0.007 and 1.75 (95%CI: 1.33 to 2.16) versus 1.09 (95%CI: 0.67 to 1.51), PÂ =Â 0.03, respectively). In obese individuals, no differential (FAST versus BFAST) expression was observed in genes involved in lipid turnover (all PÂ >Â 0.1). GLUT4, Akt protein content and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation were unaffected by FAST versus BFAST in both lean and obese cohorts (all PÂ >Â 0.1). Lower insulin-stimulated glucose uptake rates in obese versus lean individuals were eradicated when normalised to whole-body fat mass (PÂ =Â 0.416). We conclude that morning fasting upregulates lipid turnover genes in SCAT of lean individuals. Secondly, altered SCAT insulin sensitivity with morning fasting is unlikely to be explained by signalling proximal to Akt. Finally, lower insulin-stimulated SCAT glucose uptake rates in obese individuals are proportional to whole-body fat mass, suggesting a compensatory downregulation, presumably to prevent excessive de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue.

697,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
To explore whether lymphocytes in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are highly exposed to tumor neoantigens and thus express high level of programmed death 1 (PD-1), we examined PD-1 expression in SLNs and non-sentinel regional lymph nodes (non-SLNs) in breast cancer.


METHODS
We performed PD-1 immunohistochemistry in two cohorts: 40 metastasis-negative SLNs including 10 patients for each subtype (luminal A-like, luminal B-like, HER2, and triple negative breast cancer [TNBC]); and 25 pairs of metastasis-positive SLNs and non-SLNs (10 luminal A-like, 10 luminal B-like, and 5 TNBC).


RESULTS
Among 40 metastasis-negative SLNs, 34 and 6 samples were PD-1 intensity grade 1 (low) and 2 (high), respectively. PD-1 intensity correlated with PD-1-positive lymphocyte numbers (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005); TNBC had the highest PD-1 lymphocyte numbers among all subtypes. The median PD-1-positive lymphocyte number was higher in SLNs than non-SLNs. In most cases, more lymphocytes in SLNs expressed PD-1 than those in non-SLNs (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
TNBC had the greatest PD-1 expression among all subtypes, and metastasis-positive SLNs had more PD-1-positive lymphocytes than downstream non-SLNs. These data suggested that lymphocytes in SLNs are activated following exposure to tumor neoantigens and thus tumor specific, and could be utilized as a biomarker platform.",United States,Journal of surgical oncology,29193094,2017,Expression of programmed death-1 in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer.,n

During minimally invasive surgery (MIS), it is impossible to directly detect marked clips around tumors via palpation. Therefore, we developed a novel method and device using Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology to detect the position of clips during minimally invasive gastrectomy or colectomy.


METHODS
The feasibility of the RFID-based detection system was evaluated in an animal experiment consisting of seven swine. The primary outcome was to successfully detect the location of RFID clips in the stomach and colon. The secondary outcome measures were to detect time (time during the intracorporeal detection of the RFID clip), and accuracy (distance between the RFID clip and the detected site).


RESULTS
A total of 25 detection attempts (14 in the stomach and 11 in the colon) using the RFID antenna had a 100% success rate. The median detection time was 32.5â€‰s (range, 15-119â€‰s) for the stomach and 28.0â€‰s (range, 8-87â€‰s) for the colon.

Data were collected from the hospital records of all dogs that had undergone right ventricular outflow tract grafting with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch under cardiopulmonary bypass between 2006 and 2012 for the treatment of pulmonic stenosis. Echocardiographic images were reviewed and the pressure gradient across the right ventricular outflow tract re-measured. Owners of dogs still alive at the time of writing were invited to return to the hospital for reassessment.


RESULTS
Nine dogs met the inclusion criteria.

Depletion of haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) with increase in free hemoglobin and heme are important etiologies of vaso-occlusive complications in sickle cell disease (SCD). This study is the first to show an association between clinical improvement in SCD and repletion of Hp and Hx by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) using plasma replacement.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Thirteen fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) units derived from consecutive whole blood donations were thawed at 37Â°C after 10 months of storage; Hp and Hx concentrations immediately postthaw and after 5 days of refrigerated storage were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All SCD patients presenting to a single institution over a 2-year period with acute multiorgan failure syndrome resistant to red blood cell exchange (RCE) were treated with TPE with FFP replacement; concentrations of Hp, Hx, and heme were evaluated before and after TPE by ELISA.


RESULTS
Plasma concentrations of Hp and Hx decreased approximately 20% (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.002) after 5 days of refrigerated storage. Significant mean fold increases after TPE of 10 for Hp (pâ€‰<â€‰0.005) and seven for Hx (pâ€‰<â€‰0.003) and a 30% mean decrease in heme concentrations (pâ€‰=â€‰0.07) were noted in association with clinical improvement (three patients), whereas minimal increases in Hp and Hx were associated with continued clinical deterioration in one patient.

With more than 460 RHD alleles, this gene is the most complex and polymorphic among all blood group systems. The Tunisian population has the largest known prevalence of weak D Type 4.0 alleles, occurring in one of 105 RH haplotypes. We aimed to establish a rationale for the transfusion strategy of weak D Type 4.0 in Tunisia.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Donors were randomly screened for the serologic weak D phenotype. The RHD coding sequence and parts of the introns were sequenced. To establish the RH haplotype, the RHCE gene was tested for characteristic single-nucleotide positions.


RESULTS
We determined all RHD alleles and the RH haplotypes coding for the serologic weak D phenotype among 13,431 Tunisian donations. A serologic weak D phenotype was found in 67 individuals (0.50%). Among them, 60 carried a weak D Type 4 allele: 53 weak D Type 4.0, six weak D Type 4.2.2 (DAR), and one weak D Type 4.1. An additional four donors had one variant allele each: DVII, weak D Type 1, weak D Type 3, and weak D type 100, while three donors showed a normal RHD sequence. The weak D Type 4.0 was most often linked to RHCE*ceVS.04.01, weak D Type 4.2.2 to RHCE*ceAR, and weak D Type 4.1 to RHCE*ceVS.02, while the other RHD alleles were linked to one of the common RHCE alleles.


CONCLUSIONS
Among the weak D phenotypes in Tunisia, no novel RHD allele was found and almost 90% were caused by alleles of the weak D Type 4 cluster, of which 88% represented the weak D Type 4.0 allele.

708,"OBJECTIVE
Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients commonly develop chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The impact of the most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation, F508del, on the severity of sinonasal disease remains inconclusive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of CFTR genotype functional classification on sinonasal disease severity in patients with CRS.


METHODS
Retrospective chart review of patients with CF who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis from 1998 to 2015. Patients were divided into high- or low-risk genotypes based on standardized CFTR gene functional classification. The primary outcome was the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic scores, extent of surgery performed, presence of polyposis, number of revision surgeries, and Lund-MacKay computed tomography scores.


RESULTS
Thirty-eight patients harbored a high-risk CFTR genotype, and 11 had a low-risk genotype. On bivariate analysis, there was no association between CFTR genotype risk stratification and measures of preoperative disease severity or postoperative outcomes. There were no associations between genotype risk stratification and outcome variables on multivariate linear regression, adjusted for age and gender. There were significant improvements in several SNOT-22 subdomains before and after endoscopic sinus surgery (P < 0.05), but the magnitude of improvement was not significantly different on the basis of CFTR genotype risk stratification.


CONCLUSION
High-risk CFTR genotypes are not associated with worse sinonasal disease severity or postoperative symptom control than low-risk CFTR genotypes after adjusting for confounding factors.

Rice is a special crop, and its production differs from that of other crops because it requires a thin layer of water coverage for a long period. The calculation of the water footprint of rice production should differ from that of other crops due to the rice growing process. This study improved the calculation of blue and grey water footprints of rice production and analysed the variations of the water footprints for rice production under different rainfall years in Jilin Province.


RESULTS
In the drought year the green water footprint was the lowest, and the blue water footprint was the highest among the three years, while in the humid year, the green water footprint was the highest, but the blue water footprint was not the lowest.

711,"OBJECTIVES
Untreated dental caries can compromise oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). However, it is not clear which specific daily activities related to OHRQoL are compromised by the presence of this problem. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify which specific daily activities are affected by the presence of untreated dental caries using a representative sample of Brazilian children.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study using a representative sample of Brazilian children (12 years of age) was conducted. The presence of untreated dental caries was assessed using the ""decayed - D"" component of the DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth) index. Clinical exams were conducted by trained and calibrated dentists. The daily activities were evaluated using the survey Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP), considering items and domains. Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple analyses were conducted (Î±â€‰=â€‰0.05).


RESULTS
A total of 7,247 children were included, and 39.9 percent had at least one tooth with untreated dental caries, with 33.5 percent experiencing an impact on at least one of the OIDP activities. This study identified a greater chance of the presence of untreated dental caries in children having an impact on the psychological domain (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), as well as on the ""difficulty eating"" (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007), and ""difficulty sleeping"" (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.023) items.


CONCLUSION
The presence of untreated dental caries among Brazilian children was associated with an impact on specific daily activities (difficulty eating and sleeping) and the psychological domain of OHRQoL.",United States,Journal of public health dentistry,29193108,2017,Impact of untreated dental caries on the daily activities of children.,n

The aim of this study was to identify the types of skeletal trauma resulting from low falls through investigating fracture patterns and morphologies. Skeletal trauma was analyzed using full-body postmortem computed tomography scans of 145 individuals who died from a low free fall. Trauma was then contextualized to the variables that influence how a person falls using multiple logistic regression. Results showed fracture patterning primarily involved the axial skeleton and that there were a number of patterns significantly associated with the height fallen, pre-existing health conditions, and age. Analysis of fracture morphologies showed 108 possible fracture types, six of which were significantly associated with the height fallen.

713,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS
To describe the prevalence of reported tinnitus and tinnitus handicap in the all-African American Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohort, with assessment of the relationship to cardiometabolic risk and depression.


STUDY DESIGN
Prospective cohort study.


METHODS
Audiologic data were obtained from a sample of 1,314 participants of the JHS. Reported tinnitus was assessed dichotomously (yes/no) by interview and with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). The statistical relationship of reported tinnitus and tinnitus handicap to various cardiometabolic risks (i.e., hypertension and waist circumference) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was assessed with logistic and gamma regression procedures.


RESULTS
Tinnitus was found to be a highly prevalent condition (29.5%), with an additionally high rate of individuals who report at least slight tinnitus handicap (35%). Hypertension (Î² = 1.344, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.015-1.780, P = .039) and waist circumference (Î² = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.001-1.018, P = .021) were found to have a statistically significant relationship with THI score, depending on the level of covariate adjustment. Depression, as measured by the CES-D, was found to have a statistically significant relationship with both reported tinnitus (odds ratio [OR]: 1.051, 95% CI: 1.030-1.072, P < .001) and THI score (Î² = 1.029, 95% CI: 1.013-1.047, P = .001), which persisted for all levels of covariate adjustment in statistical models.


CONCLUSIONS
Tinnitus was found to be highly prevalent in the JHS, and certain measures of cardiometabolic risk are weakly related to both reported tinnitus and level of tinnitus handicap. A consistent relationship between depression and tinnitus/level of tinnitus handicap was observed.

In addition to titration by indirect antiglobulin test most widely used, anti-D quantitation by continuous-flow analysis (CFA) may be performed to assess severity of maternal immunization. Only five studies have reported its added value in the management of pregnancies complicated by anti-D immunization.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
A retrospective study of 74 severe anti-D-immunized pregnancies was conducted from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, in the Trousseau Hospital in Paris (France). Concentration of maternal anti-D was measured by titration and by CFA two-stages method (2SM; total amount of anti-D) and one-stage method (1SM; high-affinity IgG1 anti-D). These biologic data were analyzed according to the severity of the hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn.


RESULTS
The value of 5 IU anti-D/mL in maternal serum is validated as a threshold to trigger ultrasonographic and Doppler fetal close follow-up. A high 1SM/2SM ratio was associated with a higher risk of intrauterine transfusion (IUT). For pregnancies requiring IUT and without increasing titer, maternal 1SM anti-D concentration tends to correlate with the precocity of fetal anemia. In the ""without-IUT"" group 1SM and 2SM anti-D concentrations correlate significantly with cord bilirubin levels of the newborn at birth.


CONCLUSION
Altogether our results underline the importance of anti-D quantitation by CFA to optimize the management of anti-D-alloimmunized pregnancies.",United States,Transfusion,29193111,2017,Clinical input of anti-D quantitation by continuous-flow analysis on autoanalyzer in the management of high-titer anti-D maternal alloimmunization.,n

The prevalence of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) in adults has not been well characterized. The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of UHL in U.S. adults and its treatment with hearing aids using a nationally representative study.


STUDY DESIGN
Cross-sectional national epidemiologic study (n = 6,242).


METHODS
Subjects â‰¥ 18 years old with audiometric testing in the 2005 to 2006, 2009 to 2010, and 2011 to 2012 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study were included. UHL was defined as normal hearing (â‰¤25 decibels hearing level [dB HL] pure tone average [PTA]) in one ear and at least mild hearing loss (>25 dB HL PTA) in the other ear. Hearing aid usage was defined by at least 5 hours per week (2005-2006) or at least seldom (2009-2012) use. Sampling weights were utilized to ensure generalizability to the U.S.


POPULATION



RESULTS
The overall prevalence of UHL in adult Americans was 7.2% (95% confidence interval 6.1%-8.6%), with 5.7% (4.8%-6.7%) having mild and 1.5% (0.1%-2.1%) with moderate-or-worse UHL; nearly one-third of the latter reported trouble hearing. The prevalence of hearing aid usage in those with UHL was 2.0% (0.6%-6.7%). Of those with mild UHL, 1.4% (0.2%-8.0%) used hearing aids. Of those with moderate UHL, 4.2% (0.1%-22%) used hearing aids. Among those with UHL and also at least moderate subjective difficulty hearing, only 11% wore hearing aids.


CONCLUSION
UHL is common among U.S. adults. Hearing aid usage is very low, even when there is perceived handicap. Public health education is needed to increase awareness of and auditory rehabilitation for UHL.

D antigens are not taken into account in the allocation of solid organs. Female transplant recipients with D antibodies as a consequence of D-mismatched kidney transplantation may develop hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in future pregnancies. We examined D antibody development in transplant recipients who received D-mismatched kidney transplantation in absence of D prophylaxis and in a setting of reduced immunosuppression.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
From 1993 until 2015, a total of 1355 kidney patients received transplantations in our center of whom 156 received a D-mismatched graft. A retrospective analysis was conducted; frozen stored sera obtained from transplant recipients 3 months after transplantation were tested for irregular red blood cell (RBC) antibodies using a three-cell screening and an identification panel. In the case of D antibody positivity, additional testing was performed 1 month before transplantation.


RESULTS
In seven of 156 (4.5%) transplant recipients we found irregular RBC antibodies after transplantation, of which five (3.2%) were determined to be D antibodies. We observed only one (0.6%) recipient without D antibodies before transplantation.


CONCLUSION
Although the risk of D antibody development is considerably lower after D-mismatched kidney transplantation than D-mismatched pregnancy, anti-D prophylaxis may still be advisable for female transplant recipients of childbearing age.",United States,Transfusion,29193117,2017,The development of D antibodies after D-mismatched kidney transplantation in a setting of reduced immunosuppression.,n
721,"BACKGROUND
Critically ill preterm very-low-birthweight (VLBW) neonates (birthweightâ€‰â‰¤â€‰1.5 kg) frequently develop anemia that is treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Although RBCs transfused to adults demonstrate progressive decreases in posttransfusion 24-hour RBC recovery (PTR24 ) during storage-to a mean of approximately 85% of the Food and Drug Administration-allowed 42-day storage-limited data in infants indicate no decrease in PTR24 with storage.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
We hypothesized that PTR24 of allogeneic RBCs transfused to anemic VLBW newborns: 1) will be greater than PTR24 of autologous RBCs transfused into healthy adults and 2) will not decrease with increasing storage duration. RBCs were stored at 4Â°C for not more than 42 days in AS-3 or AS-5. PTR24 was determined in 46 VLBW neonates using biotin-labeled RBCs and in 76 healthy adults using 51 Cr-labeled RBCs. Linear mixed-model analysis was used to estimate slopes and intercepts of PTR24 versus duration of RBC storage.


RESULTS
For VLBW newborns, the estimated slope of PTR24 versus storage did not decrease with the duration of storage (pâ€‰=â€‰0.18) while for adults it did (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). These estimated slopes differed significantly in adults compared to newborns (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). At the allowed 42-day storage limit, projected mean neonatal PTR24 was 95.9%; for adults, it was 83.8% (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0002).

Molecular tests designed to detect the presence of active RHD gene among D- donors have been successfully applied in people of European ancestry, but not in admixed populations with a considerable frequency of RHD*Î¨. Our goal was to evaluate the performance of a molecular screening tool for identifying active RHD alleles among Brazilian blood donors classified as D- C+ and/or E+.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Pools of five DNA samples of serologically D- C+ and/or E+ donors were checked by a RHD polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay specific for RHD Intron 4 and Exon 7. When a pool result was positive, samples were genotyped individually for RHD Intron 4 and Exon 7, RHD*Î¨, RHCE*Cc, and RHD zygosity. Donors suspected of active RHD gene were further evaluated by whole-coding region and flanking intron direct sequencing.


RESULTS
A total of 405 donors were included. Two percent exhibited active RHD gene, codifying D-weak (38 and 45) or DEL phenotype. The most prevalent DEL allele was RHD*DEL1 (c.1227G>A), which is proven to be immunogenic. A high frequency of RHD*Î¨ was detected in the donors with nondeleted RHD alleles (31%), far superior to the frequency of RHD variant alleles (15.5%). The proposed approach presented sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85.7% for identifying active RHD gene.

723,"OBJECTIVE
This study is designed to analyze the survival benefits of elective neck dissection (END) in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus (MS-SCC) with clinically negative neck lymph nodes (N0) and no metastasis (M0).


STUDY DESIGN
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether END improves survival in patients with MS-SCC.


METHODS
This study is a population-based, concurrent retrospective database analysis of patients diagnosed with N0M0 MS-SCC from 2004 to 2013. Data were acquired from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Frequency functions, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were queried to analyze demographics, treatment status, and survival outcomes.


RESULTS
There were a total of 927 MS-SCC cases in the database between 2004 and 2013. This analysis revealed that for the overall cohort, END significantly and independently reduces the 5-year hazard of death in MS-SCC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.646, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.419-0.873, P = 0.047). For early tumor (T)1/T2 tumors and T4 tumors, END did not independently improve 5-year survival. However, for T3 disease, END significantly reduced the 5-year hazard of death in MS-SCC (HR = 0.471, 95% CI = 0.261-0.680, P = 0.001), regardless of other covariates, including adjuvant radiation. There has been an increase in the percentage of MS-SCC surgeries that have been accompanied by END since SEER started collecting this data, although this did not demonstrate significance (R2 = 0.622).


CONCLUSION
END improves disease-specific survival in patients with MS-SCC size > 4 cm and advanced T-stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC TIII). Therefore, surgeons performing maxillectomies should consider conducting an END concurrent with maxillectomy for those with size > 4 cm advanced stage cancer.

We analyzed heat effects on xylem hydraulics both in the laboratory and at a forest site hit by fire. Stem vulnerability to drought-induced embolism and hydraulic conductivity were measured in Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica. Control branches were compared with samples experimentally exposed to 90Â°C or damaged by a natural forest fire. In addition, xylem anatomical changes were examined microscopically. Experimental heating caused structural changes in the xylem and increased vulnerability in all species. The largest shifts in vulnerability thresholds (1.3Â MPa) were observed in P.Â sylvestris. F.Â sylvatica also showed heat-induced reductions (49%) in hydraulic conductivity. At the field site, increased vulnerability was observed in damaged branches of P.Â sylvestris and F.Â sylvatica, and the xylem of F.Â sylvatica was 39% less conductive in damaged than in undamaged branches. These results provide evidence for heat-induced impairment of tree hydraulics after fire. The effects recorded at the forest fire site corresponded to those obtained in laboratory experiments, and revealed pronounced hydraulic risks in P.Â sylvestris and F.Â sylvatica.

This analysis compared the systemic exposure of gefitinib after oral administration in CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (UM) vs extensive metabolizers (EM). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was conducted using a population-based simulator. The model was calibrated using itraconazole-gefitinib clinical drug-drug interaction data and validated with gefitinib data in CYP2D6 EM vs poor metabolizers (PM). System components of the PBPK model were evaluated using published clinical metoprolol pharmacokinetic data in CYP2D6 UM, EM, and PM. Our PBPK model predicted a gefitinib geometric least-squares mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 264 hours (AUC(0-264) ) ratio in the presence vs absence of itraconazole of 1.85, similar to the ratio of 1.78 from clinical study data. Predicted and observed metoprolol geometric least-squares mean AUC(0-24) ratios in UM vs EM were also similar (0.46 and 0.55, respectively), suggesting that system components related to CYP2D6 in the PBPK model were properly established. In addition, the PBPK model also captured gefitinib pharmacokinetic profiles in CYP2D6 polymorphic populations. The final PBPK model predicted a decrease in gefitinib AUC of âˆ¼39% in CYP2D6 UM vs EM.

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a potent mutagen and carcinogen, is reported to be present in processed meat products and, in particular, in smoked meat. However, few methods exist for predictive determining the BaP content of smoked meats such as sausage. In this study, we used an artificial neural network (ANN) model based on the back-propagation (BP) algorithm to predict the BaP content of smoked sausage.


RESULTS
The results showed that the BP network based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was the best suited for creating a nonlinear map between the input and output parameters. The optimal network structure was 3-7-1 and the learning rate was 0.6. This BP-ANN model allowed for accurate predictions, with the correlation coefficients (R) for the experimentally determined training, validation, testing, and global data sets being 0.94, 0.96, 0.95, and 0.95 respectively. The validation performance was 0.013, suggesting that the proposed BP-ANN may be used to predictively detect the BaP content of smoked meat products.

728,"Elevated tropospheric ozone (O3 ) concentration has been shown to affect many aspects of plant performance including detrimental effects on leaf photosynthesis and plant growth. However, it is not known whether such changes are accompanied by concomitant responses in plant hydraulic architecture and water relations, which would have great implications for plant growth and survival in face of unfavorable water conditions. A soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) cultivar commonly used in Northeast China was exposed to non-filtered air (NF, averaged 24.0 nl l-1 ) and elevated O3 concentrations (eO3 , 40 nl l-1 supplied with NF air) in six open-top chambers for 50 days. The eO3 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in whole-plant hydraulic conductance that is mainly attributable to the reduced hydraulic conductance of the root system and the leaflets, while stem and leaf petiole hydraulic conductance showed no significant response to eO3 . Stomatal conductance of plants grown under eO3 was lower during mid-morning but significantly higher at midday, which resulted in substantially more negative daily minimum water potentials. Moreover, excised leaves from the eO3 treated plants showed significantly higher rates of water loss, suggesting a lower ability to withhold water when water supply is impeded. Our results indicate that, besides the direct detrimental effects of eO3 on photosynthetic carbon assimilation, its influences on hydraulic architecture and water relations may also negatively affect O3 -sensitive crops by deteriorating the detrimental effects of unfavorable water conditions.",Denmark,Physiologia plantarum,29193125,2017,Elevated ozone concentration decreases whole-plant hydraulic conductance and disturbs water use regulation in soybean plants.,n

Previous studies showed controversial results for the influence of pregnancy-related and perinatal factors on subsequent respiratory and atopic diseases in children. The aim of this study was to assess the association between perinatal variables and the prevalence of asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, flexural eczema, allergic rhinitis, and sensitization in childhood and early adulthood.


METHODS
The studied population was first examined in Munich and Dresden in 1995/1996 at age 9-11 yrs. Participants were followed until age 19-24 yrs. using questionnaires and clinical examinations. Associations between perinatal data and subsequent atopic diseases were examined using logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Cesarean section was statistically significantly associated with BHR in early adulthood (Odds Ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.5-15.2), while assisted birth was associated with presence of asthma symptoms in childhood (2.2, 1.2-3.9), flexural eczema symptoms (2.2, 1.2-4.3) and doctor's diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (1.9, 1.0-3.4) in childhood, and sensitization in early adulthood (2.2, 1.1-4.3). Lower birth length (1.9, 1.1-3.2), lower birth weight (0.5, 0.3-0.9) and higher birth weight (0.6 (0.4-1.0)) were predictive of sensitization in early adulthood compared to average birth length and birth weight, respectively. None of the other perinatal factors showed statistically significant associations with the outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that children, who are born by Cesarean section and especially by assisted birth, might be at greater risk for developing asthma, flexural eczema and sensitization and should hence be monitored. Prenatal maternal stress might partly explain these associations, which should be further investigated. This article is protected by copyright.

731,"Transfusion-transmitted infection risk remains an enduring challenge to blood safety in Africa. A high background incidence and prevalence of the major transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), dependence on high-risk donors to meet demand, suboptimal testing and quality assurance collectively contribute to the increased risk. With few exceptions, donor testing is confined to serological evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV) and syphilis. Barriers to implementation of broader molecular methods include cost, limited infrastructure and lack of technical expertise. Pathogen reduction (PR), a term used to describe a variety of methods (e.g. solvent detergent treatment or photochemical activation) that may be applied to blood following collection, offers the means to diminish the infectious potential of multiple pathogens simultaneously. This is effective against different classes of pathogen, including the major TTIs where laboratory screening is already implemented (e.g. HIV, HBV and HCV) as well pathogens that are widely endemic yet remain unaddressed (e.g. malaria, bacterial contamination). We sought to review the available and emerging PR techniques and their potential application to resource-constrained parts of Africa, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of such technologies. PR has been slow to be adopted even in high-income countries, primarily given the high costs of use. Logistical considerations, particularly in low-resourced parts of Africa, also raise concerns about practicality.

732,"PURPOSE
To study the feasibility of a task-based framework composed of an anthropomorphic breast phantom and mathematical model observers (MOs) for the evaluation of system-processed mammographic images.


METHODS
A prototype anthropomorphic breast phantom with inserted gold discs of 0.1 mm and 0.25 mm diameter was imaged with two digital mammography systems (system A and B) at four different dose levels. From the acquired processed and unprocessed images, signal-present and signal-absent regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted. The ROIs were evaluated by a non-pre-whitening MO with eye filter (NPWE) and by three human observers in a two-alternative forced-choice experiment. We compared the human and the MO performance on a simple detection task of the calcification-like discs in ROIs with and without post-processing. Proportion of correct responses of the human (PCH ) and NPWE (PCNPWE ) experiments were calculated and the correlation between the two was analyzed using a mixed-effect regression model. Correlation results including the goodness of fit (r2 ) of PCH and PCNPWE for all different parameters investigated were evaluated to determine whether NPWE MO can be used to predict human observer performance.


RESULTS
PCH and PCNPWE increased with dose for all conditions investigated (signal size, processing status, and different system). In case of the 0.1 mm discs, for system A, r2 between PCH with PCNPWE was 0.81. For system B, r2 was 0.93. In case of the 0.25 mm discs, r2 in system A was 0.79 and for system B, r2 was 0.82. For the combined parameters investigated, and after excluding the 0.1 mm discs on system A because the results were influenced by aliasing, the overall r2 was 0.81. Image processing did not affect the detectability of calcification-like signals. No significant difference (p>0.05) was found between the predicted PCH(pred) by the MO and the PCH for all different conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
The framework seems promising to be used in objective image quality assessment. It was found to be relatively robust for the range of parameters investigated. However, further optimization of the anthropomorphic breast phantom and investigation of other MOs for a broader range of image quality assessment tasks is needed.

Life-threatening situations requiring blood transfusion under extreme conditions or in remote and austere locations, such as the battlefield or in traffic accidents, would benefit from reliable blood typing practices that are easily understood by a nonscientist or nonlaboratory technician and provide quick results.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
A simplified protocol was developed for the lateral flow-based device MDmulticard ABO-D-Rh subgroups-K. Its performance was compared to a reference method (PK7300, Beckman Coulter) in native blood samples from donors. The method was tested on blood samples stressed in vitro as a model of hemorrhage cases (through hemodilution using physiologic serum) and dehydration (through hemoconcentration by removing an aliquot of plasma after centrifugation), respectively.


RESULTS
A total of 146 tests were performed on 52 samples; 126 in the hemodilution group (42 for each native, diluted 1/2, and diluted 1/4 samples) and 20 in the hemoconcentration group (10 for each native and 10% concentrated samples). Hematocrit in the tested samples ranged from 9.8% to 57.6% while hemoglobin levels ranged from 3.2 to 20.1Â g/dL. The phenotype profile detected with the MDmulticard using the simplified protocol resulted in 22 A, seven B, 20 O, and three AB, of which nine were D- and five were Kell positive.

739,"BACKGROUND
Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are a biologic product originally developed to treat immunocompromised patients. In the past decades, there has been increased utilization of IVIG in autoimmune conditions. The objectives were to evaluate the clinical use of IVIG in the largest tertiary medical center in Israel and to determine top uses, estimate off-label usage, and assess consumption of this blood product.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
We conducted an observational, retrospective study involving all patients who received IVIG from 2007 through 2015. Subjects were classified into five groups according to the indication for treatment.


RESULTS
A total of 1117 patients were identified. The mean (Â±SD) ages of adults and children were 55â€‰Â±â€‰17 and 8â€‰Â±â€‰7 years, respectively. Most common indication for treatment were immune-mediated conditions (54%), followed by secondary immunodeficiency (28%), primary immunodeficiency (10%), infections (4%), and miscellaneous (4%). The main immune-mediated conditions treated were hematologic disorders (305 patients, 27%), neurologic disorders (219 patients, 20%), and rheumatologic conditions (79 patients, 7%). Overall, a significant change in study period was observed in the number of patients (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), consumption of IVIG (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), and amount of IVIG administered per patient (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Fifty-six percent of the IVIG infusions were given for off-label Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications.


CONCLUSION
In this study, we demonstrated that immune-mediated conditions represent the majority of indications for treatment with IVIG. We observed a 417% increase in IVIG administration (g) over time, attributed mainly to autoimmune diseases. Many indications are still off-label according to FDA recommendations.",United States,Transfusion,29193136,2017,Clinical indications for intravenous immunoglobulin utilization in a tertiary medical center: a 9-year retrospective study.,n

741,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS
Intranasal immunization with phosphorylcholine (PC) is known to reduce immunoglobulin (Ig)E production. However, its effects on the occurrence of allergic rhinitis (AR) are unknown. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of PC-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (PC-KLH) and to examine the effects on the occurrence of AR in a murine model of AR.


STUDY DESIGN
In vivo study using an animal model.


METHODS
Forty-five female BALB/c mice were divided into three groups; those pretreated with intranasal administration of PC-KLH followed by intraperitoneal sensitization and nasal challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) (group A), those untreated with PC-KLH followed by sensitization and nasal challenge with OVA (group B), and those untreated with PC-KLH or OVA as controls (group C). Nasal symptoms, allergic inflammation in the nasal mucosa, OVA specific IgE production, and cytokine profile were compared among those three groups. Dendritic cells (DCs) were isolated from splenic cells and PC-KLH-stimulated interleukin (IL)-12p40 production was measured.


RESULTS
The mice pretreated with PC-KLH showed lower allergic nasal symptoms and inflammation compared to untreated mice. The levels of total IgE and OVA-specific IgE in serum, and IL-4 production by nasal and splenic CD4+ T cells were significantly reduced by PC-KLH pretreatment. Furthermore, IL-12p40 production by DCs was induced by PC-KLH in a dose-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
Intranasal administration of PC-KLH suppressed allergic inflammation in nasal mucosa and antigen-specific IgE production by downregulating Th2-type immune response. Intranasal immunization with PC might be useful to prevent AR and upper airway bacterial infection.

This study sought evidence of preclinical cardiovascular changes in binge drinking young adults (nâ€‰=â€‰24) compared to nondrinking (nâ€‰=â€‰24) and social drinking (nâ€‰=â€‰23) peers during baseline, paced sighing (0.033 Hz), and paced breathing (0.1 Hz) tasks. Binge drinkers showed consistent but often statistically nonsignificant evidence of greater sympathetic activation and reduced baroreflex sensitivity. Interestingly, the structure of group-averaged baseline heart rate spectra was considerably different between groups in the low frequency range (0.05-0.15 Hz). In particular, the binge drinking group-averaged spectra showed several spectral peaks not evident in the other groups, possibly indicating two functionally distinct subranges (0.05-0.08 and 0.08-0.15 Hz) that reflect vascular tone baroreflex activity and heart rate baroreflex activity, respectively. Vascular tone baroreflex gain and power in two peaks in the 0.05-0.08 Hz range were associated with years of drinking in the binge drinking group.

Six male Wistar rats were exposed to sessions in which behavioral variability was reinforced according to a Lag contingency: Sequences of three responses on two levers had to differ from one, two or three previous sequences for shocks to be avoided (Lag 1, Lag 2 and Lag 3, respectively). Performance under the Lag conditions was compared with performance on a Yoke condition in which the animals received the same reinforcement frequency and distribution as in the Lag condition but behavioral variability was not required. The results showed that most of the subjects varied their sequences under the Lag contingencies, avoiding shocks with relatively high probability (â‰¥ 0.7). Under the Yoke procedure, responding continued to occur with high probability, but the behavioral variability decreased. These results suggest that behavioral variability can be negatively reinforced.",United States,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,29193141,2017,Behavioral variability as avoidance behavior.,y
746,"OBJECTIVE
This study was performed to assess the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of the combination of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae (XS) on focal cerebral ischaemic stroke.


METHODS
MCAO rats were used to evaluate the effect of XS on stroke. Cerebral water content was measured, and the levels of IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-12 in serum and brain were assessed by ELISA kits. Protein expressions including p-p38, p-38, TLR-4, p-ERK, ERK, TLR-5, NF-ÎºBp65, Myd88, Caspase-3 and Caspase-12 were examined by WB and IHC. Q-PCR was applied to examine IL-1Î² and IL-6 mRNA levels in the rat brain of each group.


KEY FINDINGS
XS treatment remarkedly decreased the levels of IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-12 in serum and brain tissues of MCAO rats. In the ischaemic brain, the expressions of TLR-4, TLR-5, p-p38, p-ERK, Myd88, NF-ÎºBp65, Caspase-3 and Caspase-12 were increased significantly, while the treatment attenuated the activated expressions by MCAO. XS also downregulated Caspase-3 and Caspase-12 expressions. IL-1Î² and IL-6 mRNA levels in MCAO brain tissue were decreased by XS treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
XS could protect MCAO rats by anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis through TLR4/MyD88/MAPK/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway. Furthermore, the combination has a more meaningful improvement on focal cerebral ischaemic stroke.",England,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,29193143,2017,Anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of the combination of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae against focal cerebral ischaemia via TLR4/MyD88/MAPK/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway in MCAO rats.,n
747,"PURPOSE
Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is emerging as a treatment alternative for osteoid osteoma and painful bone metastases. This study describes a new simulation platform that predicts the distribution of heat generated by MRgFUS when applied to bone tissue.


METHODS
Calculation of the temperature distribution was performed using two mathematical models. The first determined the propagation and absorption of acoustic energy through each medium, and this was performed using a multi-layered approximation of the Rayleigh integral. The ultrasound energy distribution derived from these equations could then be converted to heat energy, and the second mathematical model would then use the heat generated to determine the final temperature distribution using a finite-difference time-domain application of Pennes' bio-heat transfer equation. Anatomical surface geometry was generated using a modified version of a mesh-based semi-automatic segmentation algorithm, and both the acoustic and thermodynamic models were calculated using a parallelized algorithm running on a graphics processing unit (GPU) to greatly accelerate computation time. A series of seven porcine experiments were performed to validate the model, comparing simulated temperatures to MR thermometry and assessing spatial, temporal and maximum temperature accuracy in the soft tissue.


RESULTS
The parallelized algorithm performed acoustic and thermodynamic calculations on grids of over 108 voxels in under 30 seconds for a simulated 20 seconds of heating and 40 seconds of cooling, with a maximum time per calculated voxel of less than 0.3Î¼s. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the soft tissue thermometry to the simulation in the soft tissue adjacent to bone using four metrics. The maximum temperature difference between the simulation and thermometry in a region of interest around the bone was measured to be 5.43Â±3.51Â°C average absolute difference and a percentage difference of 16.7%. The difference in heating location resulted in a total root-mean-square error of 4.21Â±1.43mm. The total size of the ablated tissue calculated from the thermal dose approximation in the simulation was, on average, 67.6% smaller than measured from the thermometry. The cooldown was much faster in the simulation, where it decreased by 14.22Â±4.10Â°C more than the thermometry in 40 seconds after sonication ended.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of a Rayleigh based acoustic model combined with a discretized bio-heat transfer model provided a rapid three-dimensional calculation of the temperature distribution through bone and soft tissue during MRgFUS application, and the parallelized GPU algorithm provided the computational speed that would be necessary for an intraoperative treatment planning software platform.

Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and propylene glycol (PG) are used as vehicles in various medicinal and cosmetic products. They are potential contact sensitizers, including low molecular weight PEGs in nitrofurazone preparations that are still widely used in Turkey.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis caused by PEG and PG in a relatively large group of patients in Turkey.


METHODS
In this retrospective, cross-sectional, single-centre study, 836 patients patch tested with PEG and PG between 1996 and 2015 were reviewed.


RESULTS
Thirty-five patients (4.2%) showed positive patch test reactions to PEG, and 7 (0.8%) showed positive patch test reactions to PG, partly as late positive reactions with PEG. PEG sensitivity was almost exclusively related to nitrofurazone allergy. Patch test reactions to PG were currently relevant mainly with regard to the use of minoxidil, and antiherpetic or corticosteroid creams. Ten patients (25%) had concomitant contact allergies to various topical drugs containing mainly PEGs.


CONCLUSIONS
PEG sensitivity seems to be a marker for contact allergy to topical nitrofurazone in Turkey. Nitrofurazone allergy appears to favour concomitant sensitization to PEG. We would suggest the inclusion of PEG in an extended baseline patch test series in Turkey. Late patch test readings are important to diagnose delayed positive reactions to PEG.",England,Contact dermatitis,29193145,2017,Polyethylene glycol as marker for nitrofurazone allergy: 20â€‰years of experience from Turkey.,n

Here, we discuss how fMRI functional connectivity can shed light on the organization of control networks and how they interact with other parts of the brain. In the first section of our review, we present convergent evidence from fMRI functional connectivity, activation, and lesion studies that there are multiple dissociable control networks in the brain with distinct functional properties. In the second section, we discuss how graph theoretical concepts can help illuminate the mechanisms by which control networks interact with other brain regions to carry out goal-directed functions, focusing on the role of specialized hub regions for mediating cross-network interactions. Again, we use a combination of functional connectivity, lesion, and task activation studies to bolster this claim. We conclude that a large-scale network perspective provides important neurobiological constraints on the neural underpinnings of executive control, which will guide future basic and translational research into executive function and its disruption in disease.",United States,Psychophysiology,29193146,2017,Control networks and hubs.,n

Exposure to alcohol content in movies has been shown to be associated with adolescent use of alcohol, including earlier onset. This study examined the influence of movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol onset, considering the social context (whether the movie was viewed with a friend or parent). We examined whether media's influence holds across a spectrum of early drinking milestones: sipping (but not consuming a full drink of) alcohol, consuming a full drink of alcohol, and engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED).


METHODS
Data were taken from a sample of 882 middle school youth (52% female; 24% non-White) enrolled in an ongoing study on alcohol initiation and progression. Exposure to alcohol content in films was measured using a method that combines content analysis and random assignment of movie titles to youth surveys. The hazard of initiating alcohol use (sip, full drink, HED) as a function of exposure was estimated using survival analysis. Associations were adjusted for demographic, personality, and social influence factors known to be associated with both movie exposure and alcohol use.


RESULTS
Exposure to alcohol content was common. Hours of exposure prospectively predicted earlier onset of alcohol involvement across all outcomes. Viewing movies with friends appeared to augment the media exposure effect, in contrast to viewing movies with parents, which was not a significant predictor of initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to alcohol in films is involved in the entry into early stages of alcohol involvement. Findings support further investigation into the role of the media in underage drinking, especially in the context of consuming media with friends and peers. Limiting media exposure and/or stronger Federal Trade Commission oversight of movie ratings should be a priority for preventing underage drinking.",England,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",29193150,2017,Exposure to Alcohol Content in Movies and Initiation of Early Drinking Milestones.,y

Methods - Six normal human muscle biopsies were analyzed by double immunofluorescence for co-expression of AQP4 and slow or fast MHC. Results - A high percentage (64-99%) of MHC-fast positive fibers showed immunoreaction for AQP4. Immunoreactivity for AQP4 was also present in MHC-slow positive fibers, but with a higher variability (5-72%) among biopsies. Discussion - The expression pattern of AQP4 in human myofibers is highly variable among different patients and cannot be predicted for single fibers depending on MHC type expression.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of peripheral neuropathy in non-diabetic children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).


METHODS
Fifty-one consecutive normally nourished children, aged 3-18 years, with CKD stage IV and V of non-diabetic etiology were enrolled from May to December 2012. Nerve conduction studies were performed in fifty children. Blood samples were analyzed for the biochemical parameters, trace elements and micronutrients.


RESULTS
The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in our cohort was 52% (95% CI 37.65, 66.34). The majority (80.8%) had axonal neuropathy while 11.5% had demyelinating neuropathy. Isolated motor neuropathy was identified in 92.3% and sensorimotor neuropathy in 7.6%.

759,"BACKGROUND
Direct thaw and administration of previously cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cell products is a commonly used practice and should be performed rapidly to reduce cellular damage caused by dimethyl sulfoxide exposure. Cells are typically thawed at the bedside and infused by gravity through a high-flow-rate central venous catheter. An existing nontunneled catheter is occasionally used instead and often results in a slower infusion rate. To ensure expedient and consistent infusions, we validated and implemented the use of an infusion pump for thawed peripheral blood stem cells.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Validation was performed in two phases: in vitro simulation and in vivo clinical assessment. Total nucleated cell recovery and viability plus progenitor cell viability and potency were compared in vitro between two cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cell units that were either passed through a preset infusion pump or drained by gravity. The infusion rate, adverse events, and engraftment times were retrospectively compared between patients who received infusions by infusion pump (nâ€‰=â€‰35) and by gravity (nâ€‰=â€‰38).


RESULTS
No significant differences were observed in vitro between the infusion methods for all measured variables. Overall infusion rates were similar in vivo for both groups but were significantly lower for patients who had nontunneled catheters that delivered the infusion by gravity. The time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was similar for both groups.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study to assess the use of an infusion pump for stem cell transplant.

To study the effects of terlipressin (TP) infusion on systemic perfusion, estimated with pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography of systemic arteries, in a population of extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) preterm infants with vasoactive-resistant ductus arteriosus.


METHODS
This prospective, observational cohort included, during five years, 12 ELBW infants with hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and absent or reversed diastolic flow at Doppler ultrasonography of systemic arteries, despite treatment and high-dose vasoactive support. We measured flow velocity of the anterior cerebral, right renal, and superior mesenteric arteries before and after TP infusion. Changes were evaluated by Spearman's rho coefficient analysis, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Friedman test.


RESULTS
Time-averaged mean velocity of the renal artery (Pâ€‰=â€‰.028) increased, while renal pulsatility (Pâ€‰=â€‰.010) and resistance (Pâ€‰=â€‰.004) indexes, and cerebral artery resistance index (Pâ€‰=â€‰.021) decreased after TP infusion.

Maritime medical capability may be compromised by blood resupply. Air-dropped red blood cells (RBCs) is a possible mitigation factor. This study set out to evaluate RBC storage variables after a simulated parachute air drop into the sea, as limited data exist.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
The air load construction for the air drop of blood was subject to static drop assessment to simulate a worst-case parachute drop scenario. One control and two test Golden Hour shipping containers were each packaged with 10 RBC units. The control box was not dropped; Test Boxes 1 and 2 were further reinforced with waterproof boxes and underwent a simulated air drop on Day 7 or Day 8 postdonation, respectively. One day after the drop and once a week thereafter until Day 43 of storage, RBCs from each box were sampled and tested for full blood counts, hemolysis, adenosine triphosphate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, pH, extracellular potassium, glucose, lactate, deformability, and RBC microvesicles.


RESULTS
The packaging configuration completed the air drop with no water ingress or physical damage. All units met UK specifications for volume, hemoglobin, and hemolysis. There were no significant differences for any of the variables studied between RBCs in the control box compared to RBCs in Test Boxes 1 and 2 combined over storage.

Moisture regimes under flooded and different levels of irrigation such as in direct seeded rice (DSR) and system of rice intensification (SRI) lead to modulation in crop physiology, soil nutrient availability, and the soil microbiome. However, the diversity of the rice phyllosphere microbiome is less investigated in terms of the influence of fertilizer application and the method of rice cultivation (conventional-flooded, DSR and SRI).

However, solute membrane permeability needs to be well controlled to avoid increased loss of albumin that is considered to be detrimental for dialysis patients. A novel high-flux dialyzer type (FX CorDiax; Fresenius Medical Care) incorporating an advanced polysulfone membrane modified with nano-controlled spinning technology to enhance the elimination of a broader spectrum of uremic toxins has been released. The aim of this study was to compare in the clinical setting two dialyzer types having the same surface area, the current (FX dialyzer) and the new dialyzer generation (FX CorDiax), with respect to solute removal capacity over a broad spectrum of markers, including assessment of albumin loss based on a direct dialysis quantification method. We performed a crossover study following an A1-B-A2 design involving 10 patients. Phase A1 was 1 week of thrice-weekly bicarbonate hemodialysis with the FX dialyzer, 4 h per treatment; phase B was performed with a similar treatment regimen but with a new FX CorDiax dialyzer and finally the phase A2 was repeated with FX dialyzer as the former phase. Solute removal markers of interest were assessed from blood samples taken before and after treatment and from total spent dialysate collection (direct dialysis quantification) permitting a mass transfer calculation (mg/session into total spent dialysate/ultrafiltrate). On the blood side, there were no significant differences in the solute percent reduction between FX CorDiax 80 and FX 80. On the dialysate side, no difference was observed regarding eliminated mass of different solutes including Î²2 -microglobulin (143.1â€‰Â±â€‰33.6 vs. 138.3â€‰Â±â€‰41.9 mg, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.8), while the solute mass removal of total protein (1.65â€‰Â±â€‰0.51 vs. 2.14â€‰Â±â€‰0.75 g, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), and albumin (0.41â€‰Â±â€‰0.21 vs. 1.22â€‰Â±â€‰0.51 g, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) were significantly less for FX CorDiax 80 compared to the FX 80 dialyzer. The results of this cross-over study indicate that the new FX CorDiax dialyzer has highly effective removal of middle molecules, without any concomitant increase in total protein and albumin loss.

769,"Early and accurate detection of bacterial pathogens in the blood is the most crucial step for sepsis management. Gram-negative bacteria are the most common organisms causing severe sepsis and responsible for high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to develop a method for rapid multiplex identification of clinically important Gram-negative pathogens and also validated whether our system can identify Gram-negative pathogens with the cell-free plasm DNA from infected blood. We designed five MLPA probe sets targeting the genes specific to major Gram-negative pathogens (uidA and lacY for E. coli, ompA for A. baumannii, phoE for K. pneumoniae, and ecfX for P. aeruginosa) and one set targeting the CTX-M group 1 to identify the ESBL producing Gram-negative pathogens. All six target-specific peaks were clearly separated without any non-specific peaks in a multiplex reaction condition. The minimum detection limit was 100 fg of pathogen DNA. When we tested 28 Gram-negative clinical isolates, all of them were successfully identified without any non-specific peaks. To evaluate the clinical applicability, we tested seven blood samples from febrile patients. Three blood culture positive cases showed E. coli specific peaks, while no peak was detected in the other four culture negative samples. This technology can be useful for detection of major sepsis-causing, drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and also the major ESBL producing Gram-negatives from the blood of sepsis patients in a clinical setting. This system can help early initiation of effective antimicrobial treatment against Gram-negative pathogens for sepsis patients, which is very crucial for better treatment outcomes.

770,"The primary goal of this study was to examine and describe the importance of childbearing as perceived by infertile women in the Chinese familial and social context. We adopted a qualitative descriptive method and conducted semi-structured interviews with female patients diagnosed with infertility. Participants were recruited at a high-volume fertility clinic in Tianjin, China. Fifteen women with a diagnosis of infertility were interviewed for 60-90â€‰min. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Two themes supported the importance of childbearing for Chinese women with infertility: childbearing as natural law, and childbearing for relational harmony. Childbearing as natural law referred to intrinsic forces to seek a child, including (i) achieving motherhood and womanhood and (ii) experiencing a developmental transition with childbearing as a landmark. Relational harmony included three primary factors: (i) to maintain marital quality by preventing marital failure and rejuvenating an unsatisfactory marital relationship; (ii) to fulfill both authoritative and reciprocal filial piety; (iii) to build a sense of normalcy within family and social networks. In summary, infertility resulted in loss of motherhood, womanhood, and a smooth developmental transition. Moreover, it threatened relationship harmony in the marriage, family, and social life. These insights on the value of childbearing in the Chinese context can inform healthcare professionals in identify infertility-related demands and developing relevant psychosocial services for people with infertility.",United States,Research in nursing & health,29193167,2017,Childbearing importance: A qualitative study of women with infertility in China.,y
771,"PURPOSE
Different detector properties will heavily affect the results of off-axis measurements outside of radiation fields, where a different energy spectrum is encountered. While a diode detector would show a high spatial resolution, it contains high atomic number elements, which lead to perturbations and energy dependent response. An ionization chamber, on the other hand, has a much smaller energy-dependence, but shows dose averaging over its larger active volume. We suggest a way to obtain spatial energy-response corrections of a detector independent of its volume effect for profiles of arbitrary fields by using a combination of two detectors.


METHODS
Measurements were performed at an Elekta Versa HD accelerator equipped with an Agility MLC. Dose profiles of fields between 10x4 cmÂ² and 0.6x0.6 cmÂ² were recorded several times, first with different small field detectors (unshielded diode 60012 and stereotactic field detector SFD, microDiamond, EDGE and PinPoint 31006) and then with a larger volume ionization chamber Semiflex 31010 for different photon beam qualities of 6, 10 and 18 MV. Correction factors for the small field detectors were obtained from the readings of the respective detector and the ionization chamber using a convolution method. Selected profiles were also recorded on film to enable a comparison.


RESULTS
After applying the correction factors to the profiles measured with different detectors, agreement between the detectors and with profiles measured on EBT3 film was improved considerably. Differences in the full width half maximum obtained with the detectors and the film typically decreased by a factor of two. Off-axis correction factors outside of a 10x1 cmÂ² field ranged from about 1.3 for the EDGE diode about 10 mm from the field edge to 0.7 for the PinPoint 31006 25 mm from the field edge. The microDiamond required corrections comparable in size to the Si-diodes and even exceeded the values in the tail region of the field. The SFD was found to require the smallest correction. The corrections typically became larger for higher energies and for smaller field sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
With a combination of two detectors, experimentally derived correction factors can be obtained. Application of those factors leads to improved agreement between the measured profiles and those recorded on EBT3 film. The results also complement so far only Monte Carlo simulated values for the off-axis response of different detectors. This article is protected by copyright.

772,"BACKGROUND
The difficulty of supplying red blood cells within an adequate time to patients undergoing surgery is a known problem for transfusion services, particularly if the operating theater is located at some distance from the blood bank. The consequences frequently are that more blood is ordered than required; several units are allocated and issued; and unused units must be returned to the blood bank. Some sparse reports have demonstrated that remote blood issue systems can improve the efficiency of issuing blood.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
This study describes a computer-controlled, self-service, remote blood-release system, combined with an automated refrigerator, installed in a hospital at which major surgery was performed, located 5 kilometers away from the transfusion service. With this system, red blood cell units were electronically allocated to patients immediately before release, when the units actually were needed. Two 2-year periods, before and after implementation of the system, were compared.


RESULTS
After implementation of the system, the ratio of red blood cell units returned to the transfusion service was reduced from 48.9% to 1.6% of the issued units (8852 of 18,090 vs. 182 of 11,152 units; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and the issue-to-transfusion ratio was reduced from 1.96 to 1.02. An increase in the number of transfused red blood cell units was observed, probably mainly due to changes in the number and complexity of surgical procedures. No transfusion errors occurred in the two periods.


CONCLUSION
The current results demonstrate that the remote blood-release system is safe and useful for improving the efficiency of blood issue for patients in remote operating theatres.",United States,Transfusion,29193169,2017,"Electronic remote blood issue combined with a computer-controlled, automated refrigerator for major surgery in operating theatres at a distance from the transfusion service.",n
773,"The translational motion of small particles in an electrokinetic fluid flow through a constriction can be enhanced by an increase of the applied electric potential. Beyond a critical potential, however, the negative dielectrophoresis (DEP) can overpower other forces to prevent particles that are even smaller than the constriction from passing through the constriction. This DEP choking phenomenon was studied previously for rigid particles. Here, the DEP choking phenomenon is revisited for deformable particles, which are ubiquitous in many biomedical applications. Particle deformability is measured by the particle shear modulus, and the choking conditions are reported through a parametric study that includes the channel geometry, external electric potential, and particle zeta potential. The study was carried out using a numerical model based on an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerican (ALE) finite-element method. This article is protected by copyright.

774,"The partial-filling affinity capillary electrophoresis (pf-ACE) works with a ligand present in a background electrolyte that forms a weak complex with an analyte. In contrast to a more popular mobility-shift affinity capillary electrophoresis, only a short plug of the ligand is introduced into a capillary in the pf-ACE. Both methods can serve for determining apparent stability constants of the formed complexes but this task is hindered in the pf-ACE by the fact that the analyte spends only a part of its migration time in a contact with the ligand. In 1998, Amini and Westerlund published a linearization strategy that allows for extracting an effective mobility of an analyte in the presence of a neutral ligand out of the pf-ACE data. The main purpose of this paper is to show that the original formula is only approximate. We derive a new formula and demonstrate its applicability by means of computer simulations. We further inspect several strategies of data processing in the pf-ACE regarding a risk of an error propagation. This establishes a good practice of determining apparent stability constants of analyte-ligand complexes by means of the pf-ACE. This article is protected by copyright.

775,"Sensitive and fast detection of ibuprofen enantiomers is very critical for required routine monitoring and risk assessment of trace pollutants in water samples. Here a simple, rapid and highly sensitive android smartphone application for chiral recognition was developed. Aptamer-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was demonstrated as an efficient detection platform for (S)-(+)-i buprofen (S-Ibu) and (R)-(-)-i buprofen (R-Ibu). Detachment of an enantioselective aptamer from the AuNPs surface and binding with an enantiomer of Ibu lead to AuNPs aggregation, which allows a rapid enantiodiscrimination of Ibu by monitoring the absorbance changes of AuNPs solution in the UV-vis spectrum. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection for S-Ibu and R-Ibu was 1.24Â pg/mL and 3.91Â pg/mL, respectively. These probes showed good chiral recognition ability in mixed samples (i.e. S-Ibu + R-Ibu) and environmental samples. These advantages can be further developed by quantitative measurement with smartphone, which opens new opportunities for on-site detection of trace chiral pollutants in a simple and practical manner.

776,"BACKGROUND
Ablative fractional laser (AFXL) is an acknowledged technique to increase uptake of topical agents in skin. Micro thermal ablation zones (MAZs) consist of ablated vertical channels surrounded by a coagulation zone (CZ). Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) images individual MAZs at 733â€‰nm (reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM)). Further, LSCM can image sodium fluorescein (NaF) fluorescence with 488â€‰nm excitation (fluorescence confocal microcopy (FCM)), a small hydrophilic test molecule (370â€‰MW, log P -1.52), which may simulate uptake, bio-distribution and kinetics of small hydrophilic drugs.


OBJECTIVES
To explore LSCM for combined investigations of CZ thickness and uptake, bio-distribution and kinetics of NaF in AFXL-exposed skin.


STUDY DESIGNS/METHODS AND MATERIALS
Excised human abdominal skin samples were exposed to AFXL (15 mJ/microbeam, 2% density) and NaF gel (1000â€‰Î¼g/ml, 10â€‰Î¼l/cm2) in six repetitions, including untreated control samples. CZ thickness and spatiotemporal fluorescence intensities (FI) were quantified up to four hours after NaF application by RCM and FCM. Test sites were scanned to a depth of 200â€‰Î¼m, quantifying thickness of skin compartments (stratum corneum, epidermis, upper dermis), individual CZ thicknesses and FI in CZ and surrounding skin.


RESULTS
RCM images established skin morphology to a depth of 200â€‰Î¼m. The CZ thickness measurements were feasible to a depth of 50â€‰Î¼m, and remained unchanged over time at 50â€‰Î¼m (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.5). FI were detected to a depth of 160â€‰Î¼m and remained constant in CZ up to four hours after NaF application (15 minutes: 79 AU (73-92â€‰AU), 60 minutes: 72 AU (58-82 AU), four hours: 78 AU (71-90 AU), Pâ€‰>â€‰0.1). In surrounding skin, FI increased significantly over time, but remained lower than FI in CZ (15 minutes: 21 AU (17-22 AU), 60 minutes: 21 AU (19-26 AU), four hours: 42 (31- 48 AU), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). AFXL-processed skin generated higher FI compared to non-laser processed skin in epidermis and upper dermis at 60 minutes and four hours (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03).


CONCLUSIONS
By LSCM, assessment of the AFXL-induced CZ thickness was feasible to a depth of 50â€‰Î¼m, and assessment of FI from a small hydrophilic test molecule, NaF in CZ and surrounding skin feasible to a depth of 160â€‰Î¼m.

777,"The present study was undertaken to determine the mechanism of antibacterial activity of a polyphenolic fraction, composed of mainly catechin and isorhamnetin, previously isolated from Kombucha, a 14-day fermented beverage of sugared black tea, against the enteropathogen Vibrio cholerae N16961. Bacterial growth was found to be seriously impaired by the polyphenolic fraction in dose-dependent manner. Scanning Electron Microscopy demonstrated morphological alterations in bacterial cells when exposed to the polyphenolic fraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Permeabilization assays confirmed that the fraction disrupted bacterial membrane integrity in both time- and dose-dependent manners, which were proportional to the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, each of the polyphenols catechin and isorhamnetin also showed the ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes by generating oxidative stress, thereby suggesting their role in the antibacterial potential of Kombucha. Thus the basic mechanism of antibacterial activity of the Kombucha polyphenolic fraction against V. cholerae involved bacterial membrane permeabilization and morphological changes, which might be due to the generation of intracellular ROS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the investigation of antibacterial mechanism of Kombucha, which is mostly attributed to its polyphenolic content.

778,"Drug resistance is frequently developing during treatment of cancer patients. Intracellular drug uptake is one of the important characteristics to understand mechanism of drug resistance. However, the heterogeneity of cancer cells requires the investigation of drug uptake at the single cell level. Here, we developed a microfluidic device for parallel probing of drug uptake. We combined a v-type valve and peristaltic pumping to select individual cells from a pool of prostate cancer cells (PC3) and place them successively in separate cell chambers in which they were exposed to the drug. Six different concentrations of doxorubicin, a naturally fluorescent anti-cancer drug, were created in loop-shaped reactors and exposed to the cell in closed 2 nl volume chambers. Monitoring every single cell over time in 18 parallel chambers revealed increased intracellular fluorescence intensity according to the dose of doxorubicin, as well as nuclear localization of the fluorescent drug after 2 hours of incubation. The herein proposed technology demonstrated a first series of proof of concept experiments and it shows high potential to use for probing drug sensitivity of single cancer cell.

Utilizing accrued pharmacological and structural insights, we build on an established chimera approach to introduce animal toxin sensitivity in each VSD of an acceptor channel by transferring in portable S3b-S4 motifs from the four VSDs of a toxin-susceptible donor channel (NaV 1.2). By doing so, we observe that in NaV 1.8, a relatively unexplored channel subtype with distinctly slow gating kinetics, VSDI-III participate in channel opening whereas VSDIV can regulate opening as well as fast inactivation.

Determining which tissues are preserved and how biases affect their preservation pathways is important for interpreting fossils in phylogenetic, ecological, and evolutionary frameworks. Although laboratory decay experiments reveal important aspects of fossilization, applying the results directly to the interpretation of exceptionally preserved fossils may overlook the impact of other key processes that remove or preserve morphological information. Investigations of fossils preserving non-biomineralized tissues suggest that certain structures that are decay resistant (e.g., the notochord) are rarely preserved (even where carbonaceous components survive), and decay-prone structures (e.g., nervous systems) can fossilize, albeit rarely. As we review here, decay resistance is an imperfect indicator of fossilization potential, and a suite of biological and geological processes account for the features preserved in exceptional fossils.",United States,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",29193177,2017,Soft-Bodied Fossils Are Not Simply Rotten Carcasses - Toward a Holistic Understanding of Exceptional Fossil Preservation: Exceptional Fossil Preservation Is Complex and Involves the Interplay of Numerous Biological and Geological Processes.,n
781,"Combining high-resolution imaging and electrophysiological recordings is key for various types of experimentation on lipid bilayers and ion channels. Here, we propose an integrated biosensing platform consisting of a microfluidic cartridge and a dedicated chip-holder to conduct such dual measurements on suspended lipid bilayers, in a user-friendly manner. To illustrate the potential of the integrated platform, we characterize lipid bilayers in terms of thickness and fluidity while simultaneously monitoring single ion channel currents. For that purpose, POPC lipid bilayers are supplemented with a fluorescently-tagged phospholipid (NBD-PE, 1% mol) for Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) measurements and a model ion channel (gramicidin, 1 nM). These combined measurements reveal that NBD-PE has no effect on the lipid bilayer thickness while gramicidin induces thinning of the membrane. Furthermore, the presence of gramicidin does not alter the lipid bilayer fluidity. Surprisingly, in lipid bilayers supplemented with both probes, a reduction in gramicidin open probability and lifetime is observed compared to lipid bilayers with gramicidin only, suggesting an influence of NBD-PE on the gramicidin ion function. Altogether, our proposed microfluidic biosensing platform in combination with the herein presented multi-parametric measurement scheme paves the way to explore the interdependent relationship between lipid bilayer properties and ion channel function.

Due to seasonal changes in influenza virus types and subtypes, a new vaccine must be produced, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) must be estimated, annually. Since 2010, influenza vaccination has been recommended universally in the United States, making randomized clinical trials unethical. Recent studies have used a monitored household cohort study design to determine separate VE estimates against influenza transmission from the household and community. We developed a probability model and accompanying maximum likelihood procedure to estimate vaccine-related protection against transmission of influenza from the household and the community. Using agent-based stochastic simulations, we validated that we can obtain maximum likelihood estimates of transmission parameters and VE close to their true values. Sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of deviations from our assumptions were conducted.

783,"For time-to-event outcomes, a rich literature exists on the bias introduced by covariate measurement error in regression models, such as the Cox model, and methods of analysis to address this bias. By comparison, less attention has been given to understanding the impact or addressing errors in the failure time outcome. For many diseases, the timing of an event of interest (such as progression-free survival or time to AIDS progression) can be difficult to assess or reliant on self-report and therefore prone to measurement error. For linear models, it is well known that random errors in the outcome variable do not bias regression estimates. With nonlinear models, however, even random error or misclassification can introduce bias into estimated parameters. We compare the performance of 2 common regression models, the Cox and Weibull models, in the setting of measurement error in the failure time outcome. We introduce an extension of the SIMEX method to correct for bias in hazard ratio estimates from the Cox model and discuss other analysis options to address measurement error in the response. A formula to estimate the bias induced into the hazard ratio by classical measurement error in the event time for a log-linear survival model is presented. Detailed numerical studies are presented to examine the performance of the proposed SIMEX method under varying levels and parametric forms of the error in the outcome.

We aimed to clarify whether specific cognitive abilities are impaired in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), as well as to investigate the relationships among quality of life (QoL), cognitive function, and psychological factors.


METHODS
Sixty patients with DM1 were evaluated on cognitive functioning (abstract reasoning, attention/working memory, executive function, processing speed, and visuo-constructive ability), apathy, depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and QoL. QoL was assessed by two domains of the Muscular Dystrophy QoL scale (Psychosocial Relationships and Physical Functioning and Health).


RESULTS
More than half of the patients exhibited cognitive impairment in attention/working memory, executive function, processing speed, and visuo-constructive ability. Psychosocial Relationships was associated with processing speed, attention/working memory, and apathy, whereas depression and fatigue were associated with two QoL domains.

Many critically ill patients receive ketamine for adjunct sedation despite a paucity of evidence on its usage, dosing, and monitoring in this setting.


OBJECTIVE
To describe the dosing and safety considerations of ketamine for adjunct sedation in a population of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients targeting light sedation.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of mechanically ventilated patients receiving continuous ketamine infusion between January 2012 and April 2016. Data included dosing, effect of ketamine on other sedatives, total sedative use, Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) scores, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and hemodynamic variables.


RESULTS
Ninety-one patients were included in the analysis. Ketamine was infused at a median dose of 0.41 mg/kg/hr (range 0.04-2.5 mg/kg/hour) for up to 14.7 days (median 2.8 days). Concomitant sedatives were reduced or discontinued, without the initiation of an additional sedative, in 57 patients (63%) within 24 hours of initiating ketamine. Propofol was most commonly discontinued (16 patients, 36%), followed by benzodiazepines (12 patients, 27%). There was an increase in the number of SAS scores documented in goal in the 24-hour period after ketamine initiation compared with the immediate 24 hours prior (61% vs 55%, p=0.001). Patients were less frequently agitated, defined as SAS >4, after the initiation of ketamine (27% vs 33%, p=0.005). Seven patients (7.7%) required discontinuation of ketamine infusion for an ADR. There were no significant changes in hemodynamic variables after the initiation of ketamine.


CONCLUSIONS
Continuous ketamine infusion for adjunct light sedation was well tolerated in a cohort of critically ill adults, with an acceptable safety profile Prospective studies of ketamine infusion are warranted to further establish its efficacy as a sedative in this population.

Conventionally, CE has been coupled with UV-vis, C4 D, PIXE (proton-induced X-ray emission), and ICP-MS. UV-vis and C4 D are not elemental sensitive detection methods, PIXE requires the etching of the detection window resulting in a very brittle capillary, and ICP-MS is an expensive large footprint instrument. Here, we aim to develop an elemental specific detector, XRF (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry), for use with CE. A custom-built micro-XRF was tested and static LODs were determined for 19 elements (Ca-U) with both unmodified (20-926 ppm) and modified capillaries (20-291 ppm). A custom-built CE was combined with the micro-XRF and separation of Ca2+ and Co2+ was obtained. Sr2+ coeluted with Ca2+ in the mixture, but because of the elemental sensitivity of XRF, the Sr and Ca signals could be separated. After successful testing of the micro-XRF, the feasibility of using a low-cost X-ray source and detector was tested. Even lower LODs were obtained for Ga and Rb, showing the feasibility of a smaller, low-cost XRF unit as an elemental specific detector. However, the buffer selection that can be conveniently used with XRF is currently limited due to capillary corrosion, likely correlated to radiolysis. This article is protected by copyright.

As the workforce ages, occupational injuries from falls on the same level will increase. Some industries may be more affected than others.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate same-level fall injury incidence rates by age group, gender, and industry for four sectors: 1) healthcare and social assistance; 2) manufacturing; 3) retail; and 4) transportation and warehousing. We calculated rate ratios and rate differences by age group and gender.


RESULTS
Same-level fall injury incidence rates increase with age in all four sectors. However, patterns of rate ratios and rate differences vary by age group, gender, and industry. Younger workers, men, and manufacturing workers generally have lower rates.


CONCLUSIONS
Variation in incidence rates suggests there are unrealized opportunities to prevent same-level fall injuries. Interventions should be evaluated for their effectiveness at reducing injuries, avoiding gender- or age-discrimination and improving work ability.",United States,American journal of industrial medicine,29193187,2017,"Same-level fall injuries in US workplaces by age group, gender, and industry.",y
791,"Potential climate-change-related impacts to agriculture in the upper Midwest pose serious economic and ecological risks to the U.S. and the global economy. On a local level, farmers are at the forefront of responding to the impacts of climate change. Hence, it is important to understand how farmers and their farm operations may be more or less vulnerable to changes in the climate. A vulnerability index is a tool commonly used by researchers and practitioners to represent the geographical distribution of vulnerability in response to global change. Most vulnerability assessments measure objective adaptive capacity using secondary data collected by governmental agencies. However, other scholarship on human behavior has noted that sociocultural and cognitive factors, such as risk perceptions and perceived capacity, are consequential for modulating people's actual vulnerability. Thus, traditional assessments can potentially overlook people's subjective perceptions of changes in climate and extreme weather events and the extent to which people feel prepared to take necessary steps to cope with and respond to the negative effects of climate change. This article addresses this knowledge gap by: (1) incorporating perceived adaptive capacity into a vulnerability assessment; (2) using spatial smoothing to aggregate individual-level vulnerabilities to the county level; and (3) evaluating the relationships among different dimensions of adaptive capacity to examine whether perceived capacity should be integrated into vulnerability assessments. The result suggests that vulnerability assessments that rely only on objective measures might miss important sociocognitive dimensions of capacity. Vulnerability indices and maps presented in this article can inform engagement strategies for improving environmental sustainability in the region.",United States,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,29193188,2017,Spatially Representing Vulnerability to Extreme Rain Events Using Midwestern Farmers' Objective and Perceived Attributes of Adaptive Capacity.,n

In the past few years, much effort has been invested into developing a new blue economy based on harvesting, cultivating and processing marine macroalgae in Norway. Macroalgae have a high potential for a wide range of applications, e.g. as source of pharmaceuticals, production of biofuels or as food and feed. However, data on the chemical composition of macroalgae from Norwegian waters are scant. This study was designed to characterize the chemical composition of 21 algae species. We analyzed both macro- and micronutrients. We also quantified concentrations of the heavy metals and the metalloid arsenic in the algae.


RESULTS
The results confirm that marine macroalgae contain nutrients which are relevant for both human and animal nutrition, the concentrations whereof are highly depending on species. Although heavy metals and arsenic were detected in the algae studied, concentrations were mostly below maximum allowed levels set by the food and feed legislation in the EU.


CONCLUSION
This study provides chemical data on a wide range of algae species covering the three taxonomic groups (brown, red and green algae) and discusses both benefits of and potential limitations to their use for food and feed purposes.",England,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,29193189,2017,Chemical characterization of 21 species of marine macroalgae common in Norwegian waters: benefits of and limitations to their potential use in food and feed.,n

Early life sensitization to indoor allergens predicts asthma development. Aim of study was to compare allergen concentrations in day-care centres (DCC) to those in private homes.


METHODS
Settled airborne dust was collected four times a year from 20 German DCC (620 samples), and from the homes of children and day-care workers (602 samples) using electrostatic dust collectors (EDC). The samples were analysed with fluorescence-enzyme-immunoassays recognising domestic mite allergens (DM), Fel d 1, CanÂ f 1 and Mus m 1. Pet allergen thresholds that discriminate samples from homes with cats or dogs to those without were calculated using receiver-operator characteristics. Influences on allergen levels were analysed using multilevel models.


RESULTS
Allergen loads were on average higher in DCC than in homes. In DCC, 96% of the samples were positive for DM, 95% for Can f 1, 90% for FelÂ d 1, and 83% for MusÂ m 1. In homes, 84% contained DM, 48.5% CanÂ f 1, 33% FelÂ d 1, and 43% MusÂ m 1. The threshold level for homes with dogs was 75Â ng/mÂ² CanÂ f 1 (96.8% sensitivity, 96% specificity), and 46Â ng/mÂ² FelÂ d 1 for homes with cats (92% sensitivity, 94.9% specificity). In DCC, Can f 1 and Fel d 1 loads were higher than these thresholds in 37% and 54% of the samples, respectively. Allergen levels were significantly influenced by the season and room type; however, carpets on floors had no influence.

797,"Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of emerging infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour changes on epidemics can be key to improving control efforts. However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases.

Patients with posterior circulation infarction are at higher risk of early recurrent stroke, especially those with vertebrobasilar stenosis or hypoplasia. The clinical presentations of this condition vary over a broad range, making diagnosis and treatment a challenge. Hemodynamic changes and stenosis detected by ultrasonography (US) are sensitive and important indicators for further evaluation. In this study, we correlated extracranial and intracranial US characteristics with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with posterior circulation infarction.


METHODS
Inpatients with acute ischemic stroke who received both MRI and US were enrolled. Baseline characters, underlying disorders, the ischemic territory, and vascular stenosis on MRI were recorded. Series of US data, including flow volume, diameter, mean velocity, and pulsatility index, were analyzed. Patients with new infarction over the medulla, pons, midbrain, or cerebellum were enrolled as the posterior circulation infarction group. Patients with pure anterior circulation infarction were also enrolled.


RESULTS
A total of 210 patients with anterior circulation infarction (mean ageâ€‰Â±â€‰SD, 66.24â€‰Â±â€‰12.88 years) and 143 with posterior circulation infarction (mean age, 65.82â€‰Â±â€‰11.39 years) were enrolled. Significant higher frequencies of vertebral artery hypoplasia and decreased intracranial vertebrobasilar velocity in the posterior circulation infarction group (44.75% and 64.33%, respectively) were documented (Pâ€‰<â€‰.0001; Pâ€‰=â€‰.035). Ischemic lesion distributions were correlated with vertebral artery hypoplasia (55.56 %) and low vertebral and basilar artery velocities (44.44% and 25.53%), as documented by US. A low vertebrobasilar velocity was highly correlated with MRI-documented vascular stenosis (53.06%).

We studied whether the aberrations associate with severity of AP and occur in sepsis complicated by OD. Study comprises 14 sepsis patients (11 with shock), 18 AP patients (9 mild; 6 moderately severe; 3 severe), and 28 healthy volunteers. Within 48 hours after admission to hospital, phosphorylation of nuclear factor-Ä¸B (NF-Ä¸B), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 1,3, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 was measured from stimulated or non-stimulated leukocytes using phosphospecific whole blood flow cytometry. In sepsis, as compared with healthy subjects, phosphorylated NF-Ä¸B levels of monocytes promoted by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, tumor necrosis factor, or Escherichia coli cells, were lower (p<0.001 for all), pSTAT1 levels of monocytes promoted by IL-6 were lower (p<0.05 for all), and STAT3 was constitutively phosphorylated in monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes (p<0.001 for all). In AP, severity was associated with proportions of pSTAT1-positive monocytes and lymphocytes promoted by IL-6 (p<0.01 for both), constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in neutrophils (p<0.05), but not with any of the pNF-Ä¸B levels. Monocyte pSTAT3 fluorescence intensity, promoted by IL-6, was lower in sepsis and AP patients with OD than in AP patients without OD (p< 0.001). Collectively, signaling aberrations in sepsis with OD mimic those described previously in AP with OD.

801,"Humicola grisea var. thermoidea (Hgvt) is a thermophilic ascomycete that produces lignocellulolytic enzymes and it is proposed for the conversion of agricultural residues into useful byproducts. Drugs that inhibit the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity are employed in epigenetic studies but nothing is known about a possible effect on the production of fungal enzymes. We evaluated the effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza; a chemical inhibitor of DNMTs activity) on the secreted enzyme activity and on the transcription of cellulase and xylanase genes from Hgvt grown in agricultural residues and in glucose. Upon cultivation on wheat bran (WB), the drug provoked an increase in the xylanase activity at 96â€‰h. When Hgvt was grown in glucose (GLU), a repressor of Hgvt glycosyl hydrolase genes, 5-Aza led to increased transcript accumulation for the cellobiohydrolases and for the xyn2 xylanase genes. In WB, 5-Aza enhanced the expression of the transcription factor CreA gene.

The results show that the cytotoxicity of the DNA vaccine was increased 5-fold, and survival life time was prolonged 2-fold by the CpG motif adjuvant. To simplify the industrial production process, a bicistronic plasmid was constructed to carry the fusion genes of survivin / MUC1 (MS) and IL-2 and with a CpG motif in its backbone. The results showed that the anti-tumor effect of the bicistronic vaccine was the same as that of the two vaccine co-injected regime. Furthermore, the vaccine could suppress metastatic tumor foci by 69.1% in colorectal carcinoma bearing mice. Moreover, the vaccine induced survivin- and MUC1-specific immune responses in splenocytes, and induced the immune promoting factor CCL-19 and GM-CSF upregulated while metastatic associated factor MMP-9 and immunosuppressing factor PD-L1 downregulated in tumor tissue. When combining the vaccine with the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin, the survival was prolonged by about 2.5-fold.

803,"BACKGROUND
Platelets (PLTs) are especially affected by the risk of bacterial contamination. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) is an accurate method for the routine identification of bacterial isolates in microbiology laboratories. We directly applied the MALDI-TOF method to bacterial detection in PLTs. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and speed of a direct MALDI-TOF approach compared to the conventional method BACTEC.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Eight bacteria associated with PLT contamination, cited by the ISBT on transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases, were spiked into PLTs for a final concentration of approximately 100 CFU/bag (nâ€‰=â€‰5 for each strain). The PLTs were then agitated for 24 hours. One milliliter of PLTs was incubated in a shaker incubator for 8 hours at 37Â°C with 1 mL of trypticase soy broth (TSB). The spectra were analyzed using the MALDI Biotyper software. As a control, 8 mL of PLTs incubated into BACTEC bottles and a positive bottle were subcultured to ensure identification of bacterial growth.


RESULTS
Regardless of the strain of PLTs tested, MALDI-TOF analysis made detection and early identification possible at 8 hours. Analysis by BACTEC of PLTs infected with Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Providencia stuartii made early identification possible. For the remaining bacteria, the detection time by BACTEC was significantly longer than 8 hours.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrated the possibility of detecting bacteria in PLTs using a standardized culture step in TSB with MALDI-TOF, regardless of the strain, with the same specificity and analytical sensitivity and with a time to results of 12 hours.

Wound healing involves a complex and dynamic biological process in response to tissue injury. Monitoring of the cascade of cellular events is useful for wound management and treatment. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the potential of multifunctional polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) to longitudinally monitor the self-healing process in a murine cutaneous wound model.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A multi-functional PS-OCT system based on swept source OCT configuration (1,310â€‰nm central wavelength) was designed to obtain simultaneously microstructural, blood perfusion, and birefringent information of a biological tissue in vivo. A 1-mm-diameter wound was generated in a mouse pinna with a complete biopsy punch. Afterwards, the self-healing process of the injured tissue was observed every week over 6-week period using the multifunctional system to measure changes in the tissue birefringence. Further OCT angiography (OCTA) was used in post data processing to obtain blood perfusion information over the injured tissue.


RESULTS
Three complementary images indicating the changes in anatomical, vascular, and birefringent information of tissue around wound were simultaneously provided from a 3-dimensional (3-D) PS-OCT data set during the wound repair over 1 month. Specifically, inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing were characterized by thickened epidermal tissue (from OCT images) and angiogenesis (from OCT angiography images) around wound. Also, it was observed that the regenerating tissues had highly realigned birefringent structures (from PS-OCT images).


CONCLUSION
This preliminary study suggests that the proposed multi-functional imaging modality has a great potential to improve the understanding of wound healing through non-invasive, serial monitoring of vascular and tissue responses to injury.

Organizing pneumonia (OP) is composed of loose granulation tissue plugs in distal airspaces; these disappear with steroid treatment. Recently a variant labeled ""cicatricial"" OP has been described in which the granulation tissue organized to much denser fibrous tissue but still retained the usual pattern of OP. Here we report 10 patients thought to have an interstitial lung disease, and who on biopsy had a variant of cicatricial OP characterized by linear bands or small nodular masses of dense fibrous tissue that does not resemble ordinary OP.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The bands/nodules were usually randomly distributed but occasionally resembled fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in local areas. Small foci of loose granulation tissue at the edge of the fibrotic bands sometimes mimicked fibroblast foci. Recognizable conventional OP was always present, but often in very small amounts. Four cases, including one patient with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, showed formation of bone in the fibrotic bands and nodules. On CT scan of the chest some cases looked like typical OP, but some demonstrated only irregularly distributed linear opacities, sometimes with associated calcification. Follow-up imaging on 6 cases showed that the process either markedly improved or remained stable over time; no case had progressive disease.


CONCLUSIONS
Cicatricial OP with this pathologic pattern represents an uncommon form of OP that appears to be a generally benign process which may have persisting linear opacities on CT scan but that does not progress; however, it can be confused on biopsy and CT with a fibrosing interstitial pneumonia.

A discussion of issues associated with Values Based Recruitment for nurse education programmes.


BACKGROUND
Values Based Recruitment is a mandatory element in selection processes of students for Higher Education healthcare courses in England, including all programmes across nursing. Students are selected on the basis that their individual values align with those presented in the Constitution of the National Health Service. However, there are issues associated with the use of values as selection criteria that have been insufficiently addressed. These are discussed.


DESIGN
Discussion paper.


DATA SOURCES
This article is based on documents published on the website of the executive body responsible for the implementation of a policy regarding Values Based Recruitment in Higher Education Institutions up until June 2017 and our evaluation of the conceptualisation of Values Based Recruitment, underpinned by contemporary theory and literature.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
Values Based Recruitment influences who is accepted onto a nurse education programme, but there has been limited critical evaluation regarding the effectiveness of employing values as selection criteria. Values are subject to interpretation and evidence regarding whether or how Values Based Recruitment will improve practice and care is lacking. The issues discussed in this article show that Higher Education Institutions offering nursing courses, whether in England or in other countries, should be critical and reflective regarding the implementation of Values Based Recruitment methods.


CONCLUSION
We call for a debate regarding the meaning and implications of Values Based Recruitment and further research regarding its validity and effectiveness. This article is protected by copyright.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent, decreasing blood loss in hip arthroplasty. The present study investigated the relationship between TXA exposure markers, including the time above the in vitro threshold reported for inhibition of fibrinolysis (10Â mg l-1 ), and perioperative blood loss.


METHODS
Data were obtained from a prospective, double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized superiority study in hip arthroplasty. Patients received a preoperative intravenous bolus of TXA 1Â g followed by a continuous infusion of either TXA 1Â g or placebo over 8Â h. A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted to quantify TXA exposure.


RESULTS
In total, 827 TXA plasma concentrations were measured in 166 patients. A two-compartment model fitted the data best, total body weight determining interpatient variability in the central volume of distribution. Creatinine clearance accounted for interpatient variability in clearance. At the end of surgery, all patients had TXA concentrations above the therapeutic target of 10Â mg l-1 . The model-estimated time during which the TXA concentration was above 10Â mg l-1 ranged from 3.3Â h to 16.3Â h. No relationship was found between blood loss and either the time during which the TXA concentration exceeded 10Â mg l-1 or the other exposure markers tested (maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve).


CONCLUSION
In hip arthroplasty, TXA plasma concentrations were maintained above 10Â mg l-1 during surgery and for a minimum of 3Â h with a preoperative TXA dose of 1Â g. Keeping TXA concentrations above this threshold up to 16Â h conferred no advantage with regard to blood loss.",England,British journal of clinical pharmacology,29193211,2017,Is tranexamic acid exposure related to blood loss in hip arthroplasty?

Especially, clinical researchers call for methods that allow for a comparison of different diagnostic tests to a common gold standard.

Similar to our previous work using generalized linear mixed models to this task, we propose a model with a quadrivariate response consisting of the two sensitivities and the two specificities of both tests.

819,"Despite the diversity of animal welfare definitions, most recognise the centrality of the feelings of animals which are currently impossible to measure directly. As a result, animal welfare assessment is heavily reliant upon the indirect measurement of factors that either affect what animals feel, or are effected by how they feel. Physiological and health orientated measures have emerged as popular metrics for assessing welfare because they are quantifiable, can effect and be affected by how animals feel and have merits regardless of their relationship to the feelings of animals. However, their popularity in animal welfare assessment has led to them having a disproportionate influence on animal management to the detriment of animal welfare in numerous instances. Here, the case is made that a tension exists between management that prioritizes aspects of care reflecting popular animal welfare metrics such as those relating to physical health, and management that emphasizes psychological wellbeing. By re-examining the relative merits of physical and psychological priorities in animal management, an alternate animal welfare paradigm emerges less tied to traditional welfare metrics. This paradigm theorizes about the possibility for an optimal animal welfare state to exist where managed animal populations provided essential psychological outlets but protected from key physical stressors routinely experienced in the wild, might experience higher levels of welfare than wild populations would routinely experience. The proposition that optimal animal welfare could theoretically be achieved in well managed and well designed captive environments challenges a widely held ethical perspective that captivity is inherently bad for animal welfare.",United States,Zoo biology,29193216,2017,In pursuit of peak animal welfare; the need to prioritize the meaningful over the measurable.,n

AIM
To evaluate the reversibility of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia by H. pylori eradication with long-term follow-up.


METHODS
598 subjects were prospectively enrolled and followed for up to 10 years. They were categorised as H. pylori-negative (n = 65), H. pylori non-eradicated (n = 91), and H. pylori-eradicated (n = 442). Histological assessment was performed for antrum and corpus by Sydney classification.

Significant difference in atrophic gastritis between H. pylori-eradicated and H. pylori-negative groups disappeared from 1-year follow-up. Similarly, intestinal metaplasia in antrum and corpus improved significantly (both P < .05 for all timepoints) only in the H. pylori-eradicated group in comparison with that at baseline. Significant difference in intestinal metaplasia between H. pylori-eradicated and H. pylori-negative groups disappeared from â‰¥5 years of follow-up in the antrum and from 3 years of follow-up in the corpus.

822,"BACKGROUND
Hyperleukocytosis, defined as white blood cell (WBC) count above 100Â Ã—Â 109 /L, has high early morbidity and mortality from leukostasis-related complications, namely intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary distress. Initiating chemotherapy without prior leukocytoreduction may lead to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Therapeutic leukocytapheresis (TL) is used as one leukocytoreductive intervention; however, its safety and efficacy in pediatric leukemia has not been established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of TL in pediatric patients and assess the efficacy of TL in reducing WBC count in pediatric leukemia.


METHODS
Retrospective chart review was conducted on 14 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent TL during the period 2000-2014 at a single institution.


RESULTS
Mean WBC count of 19 patients who received TL was 483.2Â Ã—Â 109 /L (547.1 in ALL, 304.3 in AML); a portion of patients presented with central nervous system symptoms (15%), respiratory symptoms (10%), or both (10%). TL reduced WBC count (mean 50.7% reduction after a single TL procedure; additional 17.1% reduction after a second TL procedure in 6 patients). Short-term survival immediately following TL was 100% without any major procedural complication. Mean survival time in patients with AML was 1.5Â years and with ALL was 6.5Â years.


CONCLUSIONS
TL significantly reduces WBC number in pediatric leukemia patients as young as 22Â days old. In our retrospective study, TL was not associated with any significant complications and suggests that TL is a safe initial procedure in pediatric leukemia.",United States,Journal of clinical apheresis,29193219,2017,Therapeutic leukocytapheresis in infants and children with leukemia and hyperleukocytosis: A single institution experience.,n

Mutations in FGFR3 and the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene have been frequently found in urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder. However, related data for papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) are limited. In this study, we investigated the mutation status of the TERT promoter, FGFR3 gene, and HRAS gene in low-grade papillary urothelial neoplasms and evaluated their prognostic significance.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The cases included in this study comprised 21 inverted papillomas, 30 PUNLMPs, and 34 low-grade noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinomas (NIPUCs). TERT promoter mutations were observed in 10 (33%) PUNLMPs and 17 (50%) low-grade NIPUCs, but not in any inverted papilloma. FGFR3 mutations were more frequently observed in PUNLMP and low-grade NIPUC than in inverted papillomas (P = .009), whereas the opposite trend was noted for HRAS mutations (P < .001). Regarding the clinical outcome, TERT promoter mutation was associated with a higher recurrence rate in PUNLMP (P = .024) but not in low-grade NIPUC (P = .530). Notably, PUNLMP cases with TERT promoter mutations had a similar recurrence rate to that in low-grade NIPUC cases (P = .487).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that the status of the TERT promoter mutation may serve as a biomarker of prognostic stratification in patients with PUNLMP. This article is protected by copyright.

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C using combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) was used in several clinical trials and multicentre studies, which were somewhat limited to genotypes 1-3. The national program in Egypt is using SOF-DCV combination for large scale treatment.


AIM
To assess the efficacy and safety of combined SOF-DCV in treating patients with HCV-G4 in a real-world setting.


METHODS
Data and outcome of chronic HCV patients who were treated for 12 weeks with generic medications: DCV 60 mg plus SOF 400 mg Â± ribavirin (RBV) within the national hepatitis C treatment program in Egypt are presented. Treatment-naÃ¯ve patients without cirrhosis were treated without RBV, and those who had cirrhosis or were treatment-experienced (interferon experienced or SOF experienced) received RBV. Efficacy and safety were assessed, and baseline factors associated with sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) were explored.


RESULTS
During the first 2 months of the programme, 18 378 patients with HCV-G4 started treatment with SOF-DCV with or without RBV. Overall, 95.1% achieved SVR12 (95.4% among patients treated without RBV and 94.7% for patients treated with RBV, P = .32). Treatment was prematurely discontinued in only 1.5% of patients. The most common events leading to discontinuation were patient withdrawal (n = 76) and pregnancy (n = 5). Five deaths occurred within this group.

830,"OBJECTIVE
To describe a novel Sacroiliac Luxation Instrument System (SILISâ„¢) and its application in minimally invasive osteosynthesis (MIO) of sacroiliac luxations/fractures (SIL/F). The SILIS was designed to provide stable SIL/F reduction and accurate sacral screw placement while reducing personnel exposure to ionizing radiation during intraoperative fluoroscopy.


STUDY DESIGN
Descriptive, proof of concept cadaveric study.


METHODS
A right SIL and a left SIL/F were created on a Labrador Retriever that had died of natural causes. Bilateral sacroiliac lag screw fixation was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the SILIS, which consists of dedicated reduction and fixation instruments rigidly linked to table-bound 6-axis arms.


RESULTS
Throughout surgery, the SILIS facilitated and maintained stable reduction and allowed accurate placement of a custom designed drill guide over the sacral body without the surgeon's manual holding of any reduction or fixation instruments. The surgical team was therefore able to step away from the C-arm when acquiring fluoroscopic images, thus reducing exposure to radiation. Dorsoventral and craniocaudal screw deviation from an ideal trajectory ranged from 0.9Â° to 3.8Â°. Both screws were fully located within the sacral body.


CONCLUSION
The SILIS addresses limitations associated with MIO of SIL/F, including maintenance of reduction throughout surgery along with reliable and accurate sacral screw placement. Distance from the X-ray source is the most effective protection against radiation. Use of the SILIS allows the surgical team to move away from the C-arm during fluoroscopy, thereby reducing personnel exposure to dangerous direct and back-scattered ionizing radiation.",United States,Veterinary surgery : VS,29193227,2017,Minimally invasive lag screw fixation of sacroiliac luxation/fracture using a dedicated novel instrument system: Apparatus and technique description.,n
832,"BACKGROUND
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disease, which is characterized by hyperandrogenism (HA), chronic anovulation, polycystic ovaries, insulin resistance and obesity. At present, the mechanism by which PCOS/HA occurs has not been fully elucidated, thus, the mechanisms behind and interventions for HA in PCOS are current hot topics in research. MiRNAs have recently been shown to serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in patients with cancer. Thus, we are currently focused on studying the altered expression of miRNAs in follicular fluid and their correlation with HA in PCOS.


METHODS
Illumina deep sequencing technology was used to explore different miRNAs in the follicular fluid of women with PCOS/HA and in the follicular fluid of women in a control group. Target prediction databases were then used to analyse the target genes of different expressed miRNAs, and GO analysis and the KEGG pathway database were used to identify the functions and the main biochemical and signalling pathways of differentially expressed target genes.


RESULTS
The expression levels of 263 miRNAs were significantly different (>2-fold up-regulated or <0.5-fold down-regulated, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) between the two groups of women. For example, the expression levels of miRNA (200a-3p, 10b-3p, 200b-3p, 29c-3p, 99a-3p and 125a-5p) were significantly increased, while there was a decreased expression of miR-105-3p in PCOS patients with respect to the control. Literature has shown that the above 7 miRNAs were associated with HA in PCOS. Furthermore, 31770 genes were predicted to be targets of the 263 differentially expressed microRNAs. GO analysis and the KEGG pathway database showed involvement of these target genes in HA in PCOS.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest the presence of differentially expressed miRNAs in the follicular fluid of women with PCOS/HA versus women in the control group. The potential role of these microRNAs was elucidated using bioinformatics tools and was found to be involved in the regulation of different pathways, biological functions and cellular components underlying PCOS. The results of this research may reveal new mechanisms of PCOS/HA and suggest potential treatment targets. This article is protected by copyright.

833,"OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasonography (US) in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for identification of deep infiltrating endometriosis.


METHODS
In this prospective observational study, 159 premenopausal women who underwent surgery for a clinical suspicion of deep infiltrating endometriosis were prospectively enrolled. All women underwent 2DUS, 3DUS, and MRI. The following 3 locations of deep endometriosis were considered: (1) intestinal; (2) other posterior lesions (retrocervical septum, rectovaginal septum, uterosacral ligaments, and vaginal fornix); and (3) anterior. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 2D and 3D transvaginal US in comparison with MRI were determined.


RESULTS
Intestinal deep infiltrating endometriosis was identified by 2DUS in 56 of 66 patients, by 3DUS in 59 of 66, and by MRI in 61 of 66. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed optimal results for 2DUS, 3DUS, and MRI (areas under the curve, 0.86, 0.915, and 0.935, respectively) with a statistically significant difference between 2DUS and MRI (Pâ€‰=â€‰.0103), even when the 95% confidence interval showed an overlap. Other posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis was identified by 2DUS in 55 of 75 patients, by 3DUS in 65 of 75, and by MRI in 66 of 75. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed very good results for 2DUS, 3DUS, and MRI (areas under the curve, 0.801, 0.838, and 0.857) with no statistically significant differences. In the 12 women with deep infiltrating endometriosis in the anterior location, the nodules were correctly identified by 2DUS in 3 of 12 patients, by 3DUS in 5 of 12, and by MRI in 6 of 12.


CONCLUSIONS

834,"PURPOSE
MRI cell tracking can be used to monitor immune cells involved in the immunotherapy response, providing insight into the mechanism of action, temporal progression of tumor growth, and individual potency of therapies. To evaluate whether MRI could be used to track immune cell populations in response to immunotherapy, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles.


METHODS
Superparamagnetic iron oxide-labeled cells were injected into mice (one cell type/mouse) implanted with a human papillomavirus-based cervical cancer model. Half of these mice were also vaccinated with DepoVaxTM (ImmunoVaccine, Inc., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada), a lipid-based vaccine platform that was developed to enhance the potency of peptide-based vaccines.


RESULTS
MRI visualization of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells was apparent 24â€‰h post-injection, with hypointensities due to iron-labeled cells clearing approximately 72â€‰h post-injection. Vaccination resulted in increased recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and decreased recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells to the tumor. We also found that myeloid-derived suppressor cell and regulatory T cell recruitment were positively correlated with final tumor volume.


CONCLUSION
This type of analysis can be used to noninvasively study changes in immune cell recruitment in individual mice over time, potentially allowing improved application and combination of immunotherapies.

837,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of dexmedetomidine added to ropivacaine on the onset and duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia of ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block.


METHODS
Thirty-seven ASA physical status I-II patients with elective forearm and hand surgery under ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block were randomly divided into 2 groups. Patients in ropivacaine-dexmedetomidine group (group RD, nÂ =Â 19) received 15Â mL of 0.5% ropivacaine with 100Â Î¼g (1Â mL) dexmedetomidine, and patients in ropivacaine group (group R, nÂ =Â 18) received 15Â mL of 0.5% ropivacaine with 1Â mL of normal saline. Onset time and duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia were assessed.


RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Duration of sensory block (U-valueÂ =Â 35, PÂ <Â .001), duration of motor block (PÂ =Â .001) and duration of analgesia (PÂ <Â .001) were extended in group RD compared to group R. Onset time of sensory block in group RD was significantly faster than in group R (U-valueÂ =Â 65.5, PÂ =Â .001). Onset time of motor block showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (U-valueÂ =Â 116.5, PÂ =Â .096).

WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION
Our study indicated that dexmedetomidine 100Â Î¼g as adjuvant on ultrasound-guided axillary plexus block significantly prolonged the duration of sensory block and analgesia, as well as accelerated the time to onset of sensory block.

838,"Environmental risk assessment of chemical mixtures is challenging due to the multitude of possible combinations that may occur. Aquatic risk from chemical mixtures in an agricultural landscape was evaluated prospectively in two exposure scenario case studies: at field scale for a program of 13 plant protection products applied annually for 20 years, and at a watershed scale for a mixed land use scenario over 30 years with 12 plant protection products and two veterinary pharmaceuticals used for beef cattle. Risk quotients were calculated from regulatory exposure models with typical real-world use patterns and regulatory acceptable concentrations for individual chemicals. Results could differentiate situations when there was concern associated with single chemicals from those when concern was associated with a mixture (based on concentration addition) with no single chemical triggering concern. Potential mixture risk was identified on 0.02% to 7.07% of the total days modeled, depending on the scenario, the taxa and whether considering acute or chronic risk. Taxa at risk were influenced by receiving water body characteristics along with chemical use profiles and associated properties. This study demonstrates that a scenario-based approach can be used to determine whether mixtures of chemicals pose risks over and above any identified using existing approaches for single chemicals, how often and to what magnitude, and ultimately which mixtures (and dominant chemicals) cause greatest concern.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) induces mast cell proliferation and inflammatory reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of NG on TSLP-induced mast cell proliferation and inflammatory reactions using human mast cell line (HMC-1) cells. HMC-1 cells were pre-treated with NG and then treated with TSLP. HMC-1 cells proliferation was determined by quantifying bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Levels of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors were analyzed by western blot analysis. The productions and mRNA expressions of interleukin (IL)-13 and tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) were analyzed by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR. We found that NG significantly attenuated HMC-1 cells proliferation and Ki-67 mRNA expression promoted by TSLP. NG significantly suppressed mRNA expression of TSLP receptor and IL-7 receptor Î± in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells. NG significantly down-regulated levels of phosphorylated-signal transducer and activation of transcription 6 and murine double-minute 2 in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells, up-regulated levels of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase and p53 in TSLP-treated HMC-1 cells.

PGN recognition proteins (PGRP) are responsible for recognizing PGNs. In Drosophila melanogaster, PGRP-LC and IMD (immune deficiency) are critical for activating the Imd pathway. Here, we report the cloning and analysis of PGRP-LC and IMD (PxPGRP-LC and PxIMD) from diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), the insect pest of cruciferous vegetables. PxPGRP-LC gene consists of six exons encoding a polypeptide of 308 amino acid residues with a transmembrane region and a PGRP domain.

PxPGRP-LC and PxIMD were expressed in various tissues and developmental stages. Their mRNA levels were affected by bacterial challenges. The PGRP domain of PxPGRP-LC lacks key residues for the amidase activity, but it can recognize two types of PGNs. Overexpression of full-length and deletion mutants in Drosophila S2 cells induced expression of some antimicrobial peptide genes.

841,"PURPOSE
This integrative review describes experiences related to living with a sexually transmitted disease (STD).


DESIGN
The data search was conducted using the CINAHL, MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO and PubMed databases between the years 2000 and 2016. A manual search was also used. The retrieved data consisted of 33 original articles which were analysed using deductive and inductive content analysis.


RESULTS
Based on the results, an infected person has a need for information about STDs and experiences emotions such as a loss of purity and control over his/her body. In addition, the ego of the infected person is wounded due to the infection. Concerns about the results of treatments, suffering side effects, and experiences of unprofessional behaviour by nursing staff are related to the treatment of an STD. Having an STD in everyday life means coping with a changing condition, but there are resources that can provide support. The quality of life can also be negatively affected by an STD, and a future with an STD can manifest different hopes and concerns. In relation to other people, an STD has a marked effect, especially concerning sexual relations. The person's sex life can fade away; however, it may remain as an enjoyable experience. The infected person may also adopt safer sexual behaviours or continue with a risk-taking behaviour.

Calibration data for silicone rubber (SR)-based passive samplers are lacking for this class of compounds. The calibration data, sampling rate (Rs ) and partition coefficient between SR and water (Ksw ) were precisely determined for 23 pesticides and 13 candidate performance reference compounds (PRCs) in a laboratory calibration system over 14 d for two water flow velocities, 5 cm s-1 and 20 cm s-1 . Results showed that an in situ exposure duration of 7 d left a SR rod passive sampler configuration in the linear or curvilinear uptake period for 19 of the pesticides studied. A change in the transport mechanism from polymer control to water boundary layer control was observed for pesticides with a log Ksw of around 3.3.

844,"BACKGROUND
While it is known that informal caregiving is associated with care-derived self-esteem cross-sectionally, little is known about the impact of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. Thus, we aimed at examining whether informal caregiving affects general self-esteem using a longitudinal approach.


METHODS
Data were gathered from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 40 and over in Germany from 2002 to 2014 (n = 21 271). General self-esteem was quantified using the Rosenberg scale. Individuals were asked whether they provide informal care regularly.


RESULTS
Fixed effects regressions showed no significant effect of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. General self-esteem decreased with increasing morbidity, increasing age, decreasing social ties, whereas it was not associated with changes in employment status, marital status and body mass index. Additional models showed that decreases in self-esteem were associated with decreases in functional health and increases in depressive symptoms.

To describe the feasibility of a peer learning intervention targeting newly graduated nurses. Feasibility was tested concerning consistency of the theoretical description of peer learning with empirical findings in a new context, compliance and acceptability, as well as usability of a questionnaire measuring the intended future outcome variables.


BACKGROUND
Newly graduated nurses who meet, socialize and share experiences have described supporting each other's ability to cope with stress. Peer learning involves individuals in a similar situation learning from and with each other through interaction. When implementing new interventions, feasibility studies are used to minimize problems in future evaluation studies.


DESIGN
Quasi-experimental design with an intervention group, followed over time using descriptive methods. The study was based on the Medical Research Council framework.


METHODS
Repeated semi-structured interviews, a checklist for fidelity and a questionnaire were conducted with 10 newly graduated nurses from January - March 2015. The intervention's main component included pairs of newly graduated nurses working the same shift and having joint responsibility for a group of patients for a period of three weeks. The intervention also included three months of regular reflection by the pair.


FINDINGS
Using deductive analysis, the peer learning intervention was found to be consistent with the theoretical description. Due to the compliance and acceptability, there were lessons learned. The tested questionnaire was found to be useful.

846,"The embryotoxicity of extracts of American eels (Anguilla rostrata) was measured to determine whether maternally-derived contaminants contribute to the declining recruitment of eels to Lake Ontario. Sexually maturing, large yellow and silver eels were sampled in 2007 and 2008 from five locations in eastern Canada, including Lake Ontario; positive controls included eels from the Hudson River, United States, and Canal Dessel-Schoten, Belgium (European eel, Anguilla anguilla). Japanese medaka eggs were injected immediately after fertilization with 1 or 10 nL of eel extract, and after 12 days scored for signs of toxicity. Eel extracts did not cause dioxin-like embryotoxicity, reflecting the low concentrations of total dioxin equivalents measured chemically in these same extracts. Embryo mortality and reduced hatching success at high doses of eel extracts may reflect the bioaccumulation of legacy or emerging chemicals of concern. The results were consistent with long-term trends of declining concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in tissues of eels and other fish species from Lake Ontario, trends of declining embryotoxicity of eel tissue extracts, and recent increases of recruitment of juvenile eels to Lake Ontario. If dioxin-like compounds contributed in the past to the decline of recruitment and abundance of American eels in Lake Ontario, these data suggest that recruitment should recover, following the same trends as the recovery of lake trout reproduction in Lake Ontario.

847,"PURPOSE
Ultrafast single-shot T2 -weighted images are common practice in fetal MR exams. However, there is limited experience with fetal T1 -weighted acquisitions. This study aims at establishing a robust framework that allows fetal T1 -weighted scans to be routinely acquired in utero at 3T.


METHODS
A 2D gradient echo sequence with an adiabatic inversion was optimized to be robust to fetal motion and maternal breathing optimizing grey/white matter contrast at the same time. This was combined with slice to volume registration and super resolution methods to produce volumetric reconstructions. The sequence was tested on 22 fetuses.


RESULTS
Optimized grey/white matter contrast and robustness to fetal motion and maternal breathing were achieved. Signal from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amniotic fluid was nulled and 0.75â€‰mm isotropic anatomical reconstructions of the fetal brain were obtained using slice-to-volume registration and super resolution techniques. Total acquisition time for a single stack was 56 s, all acquired during free breathing. Enhanced sensitivity to normal anatomy and pathology with respect to established methods is demonstrated. A direct comparison with a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence and a controlled motion experiment run on an adult volunteer are also shown.

848,"BACKGROUND
When gastro-oesophageal reflux is causing symptoms or lesions in the oesophagus, this is referred to as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD can manifest itself through typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) or may lead to extra-oesophageal symptoms. Extra-oesophageal manifestations of GERD gained increasing attention over the last decade, especially respiratory disorders, because of the prevalent co-occurrence with GERD. The role of GERD in the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders has become a topic of intense discussion.


AIM
To provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of GERD in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


METHODS
PubMed was searched for relevant articles using the keywords: GERD, asthma, COPD, prevalence, treatment. Case reports were excluded, only English language articles were considered.


RESULTS
Estimates for the prevalence of GERD in asthma range from 30% to 90%, compared to an average of 24% in controls. In COPD patients, the prevalence of GERD ranges from 19% to 78% compared to an average of 18% in controls. These data indicate an increased prevalence of GERD in patients with asthma and COPD, although causality is not established and GERD treatment yielded inconsistent effects. Literature supports GERD as a risk factor for COPD-exacerbations and a predictor of the 'frequent-exacerbator'-phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite the high prevalence of GERD in asthma and COPD, a causal link is lacking. The results of anti-reflux therapy on pulmonary outcome are inconsistent and contradictory. Future studies will need to identify subgroups of asthmatics and COPD patients that may benefit from anti-reflux therapy (nocturnal or silent reflux).",England,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,29193245,2017,Review article: gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,n
849,"The acceleration of nerve regeneration remains a clinical challenge. We previously demonstrated that transcutaneous CO2 application using a novel hydrogel increases the oxygen concentration in local tissue via an ""artificial Bohr effect"" with the potential to prevent muscle atrophy. In this study, we investigated the effect of transcutaneous CO2 administration on limb function after peripheral nerve injury in a rat sciatic nerve injury model. In total, 73 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sham group, a control group (crush injury to sciatic nerve and no treatment) or a CO2 group (crush injury with transcutaneous CO2 application). CO2 was administered percutaneously for 20â€‰min five times per week. Scores for the sciatic function index and pinprick test were significantly higher in the CO2 group than control group. The muscle wet weight ratios of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles were higher in the CO2 group than control group. Electrophysiological examination showed that the CO2 group had higher compound motor action potential amplitudes and shorter distal motor latency than the control group. Histological examination of the soleus muscle sections at postoperative week 2 showed shorter fiber diameter in the control group than in the CO2 group. The mRNA expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 was lower, mRNA expression of VEGF and myogenin and MyoD was higher in CO2 group at postoperative week 2 compared to the control group.

Subjects had a â‰¥6-month history of asthma and screening eNO â‰¥60 parts per billion. At the start of each treatment period, eNO was â‰¥55 parts per billion, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second was â‰¥50% predicted. Subjects attended a clinic visit daily on consecutive mornings during each of 3 1-week treatment periods to measure eNO and receive once-daily doses of 100/50, 250/50, or 500/50 fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination product (AdvairÂ® Diskus). Daily eNO value recorded was the highest of 3 measurements; 1 inhalation of treatment was then administered. Procedures were repeated for 3 treatment cycles, separated by 14-day minimum washouts.

851,"BACKGROUND/AIM
We investigated the prognostic impact of muscle volume loss (MVL) and function decline in patients undergoing resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).


MATERIAL/METHODS
We enrolled 171 naÃ¯ve HCC patients treated with resection from 2007 to 2015, after excluding those lacking spirometry or CT findings, who had received non-curative treatments, or with restrictive or obstructive lung disorders. The median peak expiratory flow rate (%PEF) was set as the cut-off value for muscle function decline and MVL was diagnosed using a previously reported value. Clinical backgrounds and prognosis were retrospectively evaluated.


RESULTS
Overall survival rate (OSR) was lower in the MVL (n=35) as compared to the non-MVL (n=136) group (1-/3-/5-year OSR=88.2%/81.6%/55.6% vs. 91.0%/81.5%/74.8%, respectively; P=0.0083), while there were no differences regarding hepatic function or tumor burden between the groups. Child-Pugh class B (HR 3.510, 95%CI: 1.558-7.926, P=0.0025), beyond Milan criteria (HR 1.866, 95%CI: 1.024-3.403, P=0.042), and presence of MVL (HR 1.896, 95%CI: 1.052-3.416) were significant prognostic factors. The decreased %PEF group (n=84) showed a higher rate of postoperative delirium than the others (n=87) (27.4% vs. 11.5%, P=0.0088). The cut-off values for %PEF and age for postoperative delirium were 63.3% (AUROC 0.697) and 73 years old (AUROC 0.734), respectively. Delirium was observed in 50.0% (14/28) of patients with both factors, 23.8% (15/63) of those with 1 factor, and 5.0% (4/80) of those without either factor.


CONCLUSION

852,"Reconstruction of thigh defects is usually straightforward, but in cases of poor soft tissue quality, free flap reconstruction is not possible due to the absence of recipient vessels. The turbocharge technique may increase the viable, vascularized area of a flap. In this report we present a case of the use of a turbocharged bilateral pedicled DIEP flap for reconstruction of thigh defect without recipient vessels. A 29-year-old woman who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy for a leiomyosarcoma on the left thigh. Six weeks later, complete tumor excision and a femoropopliteal bypass with contralateral saphenous vein was performed. In the following days the wound had dehiscence, infection, necrosis of the surrounding muscles and exposure of femoropopliteal bypass. No recipient vessels were available for free flap and critical limb ischemia due to bypass thrombosis was detected. The reconstruction of a large thigh defect (30Â Ã—Â 12Â cm) and the coverage of a femoropopliteal bypass with a turbocharged bilateral pedicled DIEP flap was performed. A flap including the entire infraumbilical tissue was designed and the anastomosis of the proximal stump of the right inferior epigastric vessels with the distal ends of the inferior left epigastric vessels was performed to increase the viable area. The flap survived without any complications during the postoperative period. At 12-month follow up, coverage was stable with no tumor recurrence. Our result suggests that a turbocharged bilateral pedicled DIEP flap may be an option for reconstructing large tissue defects when no recipient vessels are available for free flap.",United States,Microsurgery,29193249,2017,Turbocharged bilateral pedicled DIEP flap for reconstruction of thigh defect without recipient vessels: A case report.,n
853,"PURPOSE
T2 -weighted sequences are particularly sensitive to the radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity problem at ultra-high-field because of the errors accumulated by the imperfections of the train of refocusing pulses. As parallel transmission (pTx) has proved particularly useful to counteract RF heterogeneities, universal pulses were recently demonstrated to save precious time and computational efforts by skipping B1 calibration and online RF pulse tailoring. Here, we report a universal RF pulse design for non-selective refocusing pulses to mitigate the RF inhomogeneity problem at 7T in turbo spin-echo sequences with variable flip angles.


METHOD
Average Hamiltonian theory was used to synthetize a single non-selective refocusing pulse with pTx while optimizing its scaling properties in the presence of static field offsets. The design was performed under explicit power and specific absorption rate constraints on a database of 10 subjects using a 8Tx-32Rx commercial coil at 7T. To validate the proposed design, the RF pulses were tested in simulation and applied in vivo on 5 additional test subjects.


RESULTS
The root-mean-square rotation angle error (RA-NRMSE) evaluation and experimental data demonstrated great improvement with the proposed universal pulses (RA-NRMSE âˆ¼8%) compared to the standard circularly polarized mode of excitation (RA-NRMSE âˆ¼26%).


CONCLUSION
This work further completes the spectrum of 3D universal pulses to mitigate RF field inhomogeneity throughout all 3D MRI sequences without any pTx calibration. The approach returns a single pulse that can be scaled to match the desired flip angle train, thereby increasing the modularity of the proposed plug and play approach. Magn Reson Med, 2017.

855,"The Rab-family GTPases mainly regulate intracellular vesicle transport, and play important roles in the innate immune response in invertebrates. However, the function and signal transduction of Rab proteins in immune reactions remain unclear in silkworms. In this study, we analyzed a Rab-related protein of silkworm Bombyx mori (BmRABRP) by raising antibodies against its bacterially expressed recombinant form. Tissue distribution analysis showed that BmRABRP mRNA and protein were high expressed in the Malpighian tubule and fat body, respectively. However, among the different stages, only the fourth instar larvae and pupae showed significant BmRABRP levels. After challenge with four pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, BmNPV, Beauveria bassiana, Micrococcus luteus), the expression of BmRABRP mRNA in the fat body was significantly upregulated. In contrast, the BmRABRP protein was significantly upregulated after infection with BmNPV, while it was downregulated by E. coli, B. bassiana, and M. luteus. A specific dsRNA was used to explore the immune function and relationship between BmRABRP and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. After BmRABRP gene interference, significant reduction in the number of nodules and increased mortality suggested that BmRABRP plays an important role in silkworm's response to bacterial challenge. In addition, four key genes (BmHOP, BmSTAT, BmSOCS2, and BmSOCS6) of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway showed significantly altered expressions after BmRABRP silencing. BmHOP and BmSOCS6 expressions were significantly decreased, while BmSTAT and BmSOCS2 were significantly upregulated.

858,"INTRODUCTION
Successful breast reconstruction using deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps depends on optimal perforator choice. Circummuscular wraparound medial perforators allow for no rectus dissection and minimal fascial incisions, often presenting as an ideal option. The aim of our study is to evaluate outcomes of the single medial wraparound perforator flap in comparison to more traditional transmuscular single-perforator DIEP flaps.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A retrospective chart review was conducted of all DIEP flaps performed by the senior author from 2011 to 2016, yielding 269 flaps on 157 patients. For this study, we included all patients who underwent reconstruction of the breast(s) and possessed circummuscular perforators arising from the DIE vessels. A control group consisted of all consecutive patients with transmuscular one-perforator DIEP flaps. Patient details and their postoperative outcomes were collected.


RESULTS
In our study, eight patients (5.1%) were of the medial wraparound variety. Sixteen control patients (10.2%) with similar comorbidities had flaps that were of the more traditional single perforator transmuscular variety. There was a slight trend toward decreased operative time in the medial wraparound group, however, it was not found to be statistically significant (536Â Â±Â 81 vs. 572Â Â±Â 84Â min, PÂ =Â .377). Complication profiles were similar between groups (25.0 vs. 18.8%, PÂ =Â .722), with no increased rates of fat necrosis in the wraparound cohort.


CONCLUSION
Based on our findings, using a medial wraparound perforator is a safe and reliable option when compared with a single transmuscular perforator DIEP flap. Choosing the wraparound perforator may show benefit as it eliminates muscular dissection and nerve damage, and tends to minimize fascial incision length.",United States,Microsurgery,29193255,2017,Evaluation of the single medial circummuscular perforator DIEP flap: Outcomes and comparison to traditional transmuscular single perforator flap.,n
859,"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the formation of pathological bone in ectopic sites and it can have serious consequences for functional outcomes. For many years, its main clinical relevance was as a rare complication of elective joint arthroplasty or CNS injury and a number of prophylaxes were developed to mitigate against it in these settings. As a consequence of changes in patterns of wounding and survival in conflicts since the turn of the century, post-traumatic HO has become much more common and case severity has increased. It represents one of the main barriers to rehabilitation in a large cohort of combat-injured patients. However, extant prophylaxes have not been shown to be effective or appropriate in this patient cohort. In addition, the lack of reliable early detection or means of predicting which patients will develop HO is another barrier to effective prevention. This review examines the current state of understanding of post-traumatic HO including the historical context, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical issues, currently prophylaxis and detection, management, and potential future approaches. Our aims are to highlight the current lack of effective means of early detection and prevention of HO after major trauma and to stimulate research into novel solutions to this challenging problem.

860,"Aquaporin (AQP) channels in the Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) family are known to facilitate transmembrane water fluxes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Some classes of AQPs also conduct ions, glycerol, urea, CO2 , nitric oxide, and other small solutes. Ion channel activity has been demonstrated for mammalian AQPs 0, 1, 6, Drosophila big brain (BIB), soybean nodulin 26, and rockcress AtPIP2;1. More classes are likely to be discovered. Newly identified blockers are providing essential tools for establishing physiological roles of some of the AQP dual water and ion channels. For example, the arylsulfonamide AqB011 which selectively blocks the central ion pore of mammalian AQP1 has been shown to impair migration of HT29 colon cancer cells. Traditional herbal medicines are sources of selective AQP1 inhibitors that also slow cancer cell migration. The finding that plant AtPIP2;1 expressed in root epidermal cells mediates an ion conductance regulated by calcium and protons provided insight into molecular mechanisms of environmental stress responses. Expression of lens MIP (AQP0) is essential for maintaining the structure, integrity and transparency of the lens, and Drosophila BIB contributes to neurogenic signalling pathways to control the developmental fate of fly neuroblast cells; however, the ion channel roles remain to be defined for MIP and BIB. A broader portfolio of pharmacological agents is needed to investigate diverse AQP ion channel functions in situ.

861,"Pieris rapae, a serious Lepidoptera pest of cultivated crucifers, utilizes midgut enzymes to digest food and detoxify secondary metabolites from host plants. A recombinant trypsin inhibitor (COTI) from nonhost plant, Cassia obtusifolia, significantly decreased activities of trypsin-like proteases in the larval midgut on Pieris rapae and could suppress the growth of larvae. In order to know how COTI took effect, transcriptional profiles of P. rapae midgut in response to COTI was studied. A total of 51,544 unigenes were generated and 45.86% of which had homologs in public databases. Most of the regulated genes associated with digestion, detoxification, homeostasis, and resistance were downregulated after ingestion of COTI. Meanwhile, several unigenes in the integrin signaling pathway might be involved in response to COTI. Furthermore, using comparative transcriptome analysis, we detected differently expressing genes and identified a new reference gene, UPF3, by qRT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Therefore, it was suggested that not only proteolysis inhibition, but also suppression of expression of genes involved in metabolism, development, signaling, and defense might account for the anti-insect resistance of COTI.",United States,Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology,29193258,2017,Comparative transcriptome analysis provides insights of anti-insect molecular mechanism of Cassia obtusifolia trypsin inhibitor against Pieris rapae.,n

Male BALB/c mice (7 or 8 weeks old) were intratracheally administered PM2.5 (0.1Â mg) four times, at 2Â week intervals, and dissected 24Â h after the final administration. The effect of six types of PM2.5, collected in Shenyang or Beijing (China) and Kitakyushu (Japan), on splenocytes was examined. Our results revealed a strong correlation between the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not that of Î²-glucan and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, attached to PM2.5 and the effect of PM2.5 on cell activity. PM2.5 with a low amount of LPS (PM2.5LL) reduced splenocyte mitogen-induced proliferation and cytokine production compared with that in control mice. The suppressive effects of PM2.5LL on proliferation and interleukin-2 production in splenocytes were rescued by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.

863,"PURPOSE
To develop and evaluate a novel dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging technique called RACER-GRASP (Respiratory-weighted, Aortic Contrast Enhancement-guided and coil-unstReaking Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel) MRI that extends GRASP to include automatic contrast bolus timing, respiratory motion compensation, and coil-weighted unstreaking for improved imaging performance in liver MRI.


METHODS
In RACER-GRASP, aortic contrast enhancement (ACE) guided k-space sorting and respiratory-weighted sparse reconstruction are performed using aortic contrast enhancement and respiratory motion signals extracted directly from the acquired data. Coil unstreaking aims to weight multicoil k-space according to streaking artifact level calculated for each individual coil during image reconstruction, so that coil elements containing a high level of streaking artifacts contribute less to the final results. Self-calibrating GRAPPA operator gridding was applied as a pre-reconstruction step to reduce computational burden in the subsequent iterative reconstruction. The RACER-GRASP technique was compared with standard GRASP reconstruction in a group of healthy volunteers and patients referred for clinical liver MR examination.


RESULTS
Compared with standard GRASP, RACER-GRASP significantly improved overall image quality (average score: 3.25 versus 3.85) and hepatic vessel sharpness/clarity (average score: 3.58 versus 4.0), and reduced residual streaking artifact level (average score: 3.23 versus 3.94) in different contrast phases. RACER-GRASP also enabled automatic timing of the arterial phases.

The aortic contrast enhancement-guided sorting, respiratory motion suppression and coil unstreaking introduced by RACER-GRASP improve upon the imaging performance of standard GRASP for free-breathing dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of the liver.

The older persons lacked knowledge about their condition, which generated poor insight into their medical treatment and this in turn affected their daily life. They had thoughts and questions about their medication, but did not have an opportunity to ask the questions because of lack of follow-up from the healthcare system.

Quantitative real-time ploymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the knock-down of Apserpin-12 enhanced the prophenoloxidase (PPO) cascade stimulated by Micrococcus luteus in hemolymph, whereas addition of recombinant Apserpin-12 protein along with same elicitor led to down-regulate PPO activation. Following different microbial challenge (E. coli, Beauveria bassiana, M. Luteus, and nuclear polyhedrosis virus), the expression of Apserpin-12 mRNA was induced significantly. Furthermore, the Apserpin-12 double-stranded RNA administration elicited the expression of antimicrobial peptides, while the treatment with recombinant protein suppressed their expression. Tissue profile of Apserpin-12 indicated that it is expressed in all examined tissues, that is, hemolymph, malpighian tubules, midgut, silk gland, integument, and fat body with variation in their transcript levels. We concluded that Apserpin-12 may regulate PPO activation and inhibit the production of antimicrobial peptides in A. pernyi, suggesting important role in its immune system.",United States,Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology,29193264,2017,Role of Antheraea pernyi serpin 12 in prophenoloxidase activation and immune responses.,n
868,"In the era of deinstitutionalisation of psychiatric patients, steady or even increasing rates of compulsory commitment to care (CCC) are an intriguing phenomenon to analyse. From a clinical, legal and ethical perspective, CCC continues to be a controversial practice in psychiatry, and perhaps even more so when applied to patients with severe substance use disorder (SUD). Several reasons make it controversial. The lack of consensus about the benefits of CCC and professional disagreement about what mental illness and autonomy mean in the case of SUD make it difficult to apply ethically sound clinical decision-making in CCC. Also, the medico-legal framework underlying CCC use sometimes appears to foster the use of reductionist clinical evaluation. Layered on top of these issues is how stakeholders view coercion. There is a discrepancy between clinicians' and patients' perception of coercion, which leads to clinician-patient differences on whether CCC is necessary. Moreover, the way in which the evaluation is typically carried out influences patients' perception of coercion and subsequently their motivation for participating fully in treatment. In this article, we explore the value of care ethics, often applied to care practices such as nursing, when applied to more procedural medical practices, such as decision-making regarding CCC. The care-ethical approach views decision-making as part of a dynamic care process, within which the lived experience, interpretative dialogue and promotion of dignity are core features. Embracing this new framework means a paradigm shift in when the therapeutic relationship begins, namely, investing in it occurs while conducting an evaluation for a possible CCC procedure. Unlike in current typical evaluations, early cultivation of the therapeutic relationship enables the patient to participate in the definition of his needs, reduces perceived coercion and negative emotions and enhances treatment motivation. Finally, implications of this novel approach for clinical practice are formulated and discussed.",Sweden,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,29193265,2017,Substance use disorder and compulsory commitment to care: a care-ethical decision-making framework.,n
869,"PURPOSE
A new diffusion-mapping method based on single-shot overlapping-echo detachment (DM-OLED) planar-imaging sequence, along with a corresponding separation algorithm, is proposed to achieve reliable quantitative diffusion mapping in a single shot. The method can resist the effects of motion and help in detecting the quick variation of diffusion under different physiological status.


METHODS
The echo-planar imaging method is combined with two excitation pulses with small flip angle to gain overlapping-echo signal in a single shot. Then the overlapping signals are separated by a separation algorithm and used for diffusion computation. Numerical simulation, phantom, and in vivo rat experiments were performed to verify the efficiency, accuracy, and motion tolerance of DM-OLED.


RESULTS
The DM-OLED sequence could obtain reliable diffusion maps within milliseconds in numerical simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Compared with conventional diffusion mapping with spin-echo echo-planar imaging, DM-OLED has higher time resolution and fewer motion-incurred errors in the apparent diffusion coefficient maps.

As a reliable fast diffusion measurement tool, DM-OLED shows promise for real-time dynamic diffusion mapping and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Magn Reson Med, 2017.

870,"Oral tolerance is defined as a state of systemic hyporesponsiveness to an antigen that has been previously administered by the oral route. Many factors affect oral tolerance induction, some of them related to antigen, some related to the animal. The age of the animal is one of the most important factors that affect oral tolerance as aging brings many alterations in immune responses. Herein, we demonstrated that both the oral tolerance as well as pattern of immune reactivity triggered in early life was kept up to 15 months regarding the magnitude of antibody production, cell proliferation and cytokine profile when compared to immune responses induced in old mice. Therefore, our results corroborate with a promising proposal for pre vaccination during childhood and young age, and a booster in older age, to make sure that the primary immunization in early life is not lost in aged individuals.

871,"Animals maintained in captivity exhibit rapid changes in phenotypic traits, which may be maladaptive for natural environments. The phenotype can shift away from the wild phenotype via transgenerational effects, with the environment experienced by parents influencing the phenotype and fitness of offspring. There is emerging evidence that controlling transgenerational effects could help mitigate the effects of captivity, improving the success of captively bred animals post release. However, controlling transgenerational effects requires knowledge of the mechanisms driving transgenerational changes. To better understand the genetic mechanisms that contribute to transgenerational effects in captivity we investigated the heritability of behavioral phenotypes using mid parent- and single parent-offspring regressions in a population of captive-reared house mouse (Mus musculus) that we had previously shown exhibit transgenerational changes in boldness and activity behavioral types. Slopes for boldness and activity were all positive, indicating a low to moderate degree of heritability. Though, none of the heritability estimates were statistically significant due to the large surrounding errors. However, the large error surrounding the heritability estimates may also indicate that there is variability in heritability between behavioral traits within the boldness and activity behavioral types. The implication of this finding is that the potential for heritable genetic changes in captivity varies considerably between traits. We conclude that continued investigation of the potential for traits to evolve in captivity is needed to better inform captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",United States,Zoo biology,29193268,2017,What role does heritability play in transgenerational phenotypic responses to captivity?

We investigated the effects of PNPLA3 rs738409, TM6SF2 rs58542926, and MBOAT7-TMC4 rs641738 variants on metabolic phenotypes and their combined effects on the histological severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).


METHODS
We genotyped rs738409, rs58542926, and rs641738 in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 416) and healthy controls (n = 109). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and adipose tissue insulin resistance (adipo-IR) were calculated.


RESULTS
The rs738409 and rs58542926 variants, but not rs641738, were associated with not only NASH (odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-2.73 and OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.04-3.51) but also with significant fibrosis (â‰¥F2) (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.11-2.11 and OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.02-3.46) in NAFLD, even after adjustment for metabolic risk factors. Of both variants, only rs738409 was associated with HOMA-IR and adipo-IR even in healthy controls (P = 0.046 and 0.002, respectively) as well as in the entire study cohort (P = 0.016 and 0.048, respectively).

We performed a prospective analysis of patients receiving ECP treatment for GVHD to identify a clinical pathway and resource utilization of this process. The cohort included consecutive allogeneic stem cell recipients with GVHD. ECP was performed using the CELLEX Photopheresis System or the UVAR XTS Photopheresis System (Therakos, Inc, Exton, PA). A clinical pathway was developed and a time and motion study was conducted to define the resource utilization and costs associated with ECP. Patients were treated with either CELLEX (nâ€‰=â€‰18 procedures) or UVAR (nâ€‰=â€‰4 procedures). Total time commitment for each procedure for the 2 machines differed. The time for ECP was 117 min (median, range: 91-164 min) using CELLEX and 161 min (median; range: 140-210) using the UVAR-XTS machine. Total costs of each ECP procedure were $3420.50. There is a considerable time commitment of the patient and the clinical staff when employing ECP to treat GVHD.

875,"This study was designed to investigate the possible synergism of amlodipine and candesartan on the reduction of blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive rats. The end organ protection was also observed. In acute experiment, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with intragastric administration of amlodipine (0.5, 1, 2, 3 mg/kg), candesartan (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 mg/kg), and 14 different combinations to find the possible ratio of synergistic interaction. In two kidneys, one-clip (2K1C) rats, the effects of amlodipine (1 mg/kg), canderastan (2 mg/kg) and their combination on BP reduction were also observed. In chronic study, SHRs were treated with amlodipine (1 mg/kg), candesartan (2 mg/kg), and their combination for 5 months. Organ damage evaluation was performed after BP recording. The probability sum test (q test) was used to evaluate the synergistic action. There is a synergistic interaction between amlodipine and candesartan on BP reduction. The optimal dose ratio is 1:2. The synergistic effect was also confirmed by 2K1C hypertensive rats. In chronic study, this combination (1:2) possessed an obvious synergism on the reduction of BP and BP variability (BPV) and protection on end organs. Multiple-regression analysis showed that heart and aortic hypertrophy indexes and glomerular damage parameters were positively related to BP and BPV.

876,"Excitotoxicity, due to overstimulation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), has a pivotal role in many neurological disorders. However, NMDAR antagonists often cause side effects, and identifying more druggable therapeutic targets for NMDAR excitotoxicity is an important goal. Activation of caspases is a downstream effect of excitotoxicity that may be critically involved in NMDAR-mediated cell death. Caspase-6 (casp6) in particular has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer disease. Using N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injuries of primary rat neurons, we demonstrate that there is an early increase in caspase profiles after an excitotoxic event at the level of mRNA, protein, and activity. Casp6 is elevated and activated first, followed by caspase-8 and caspase-3. Similarly, known casp6 substrates huntingtin, as well as novel casp6 substrates serine/threonine kinase 3 and death domain-associated protein, are cleaved in similar temporal patterns post NMDA. On the basis of these data, we propose that casp6 may be an initiator caspase in apoptotic cascades leading to neuronal death after an excitotoxic event and suggest casp6 as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders where NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to play a role.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193273,2017,Activation of caspase-6 and cleavage of caspase-6 substrates is an early event in NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.,n

Serum levels of melatonin decrease in MS patients who are also at risk of osteoporosis. Procalcitonin (proCT) has been reported as a biomarker of systemic inflammation and autoimmune disease, however, its changes in MS patients has not been well explored. This study investigated, using ELISA, the clinical correlation between serum melatonin and proCT in MS patients. We then assessed the effect of melatonin (10mg/kg) therapy on bone metabolism and osteoporosis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS and in MS patients. Data showed a significant increase (*p<0.05) in serum levels of proCT in MS patients, inversely correlated (râ€Š=â€Š-0.945; pâ€Š=â€Š0.0001) to melatonin levels, compared to healthy participants. On the other hand, melatonin therapy ameliorated EAE severity by significantly decreasing (*p<0.05) mean clinical scores, compared to control EAE mice. In addition, serum levels of proCT significantly (**p<0.01) increased in EAE mice, compared to controls, which was significantly (*p<0.05) reduced by melatonin. Moreover, EAE-induced decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, and osteocalcin (OCN) in EAE mice, compared to controls, was significantly (*p<0.05) increased by melatonin. Finally, OCN serum levels were found to be significantly decreased (*p<0.05) in MS patients, in comparison to controls.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common respiratory morbidity in immature infants. This review describes the diagnosis of BPD has evolved and summarises the therapeutic approaches that have made it possible to limit the incidence of BPD.


METHOD
We reviewed the literature from the first definition of BPD by Northway in 1967 to the surfactant treatment policies that are currently in use, drawing on more than 50 papers up to 2017.


RESULTS
Our review showed that improvements in neonatal survival have been associated with an increased risk of severe BPD, significant levels of long-term morbidity and the increased use of healthcare resources. These issues have encouraged researchers to explore potential new treatments that limit the incidence of BPD. Repeated surfactant instillation and the use of surfactant as a vehicle for budesonide are promising strategies for alleviating the burden of chronic lung disease. On-going research on surfactant or stem cell therapy may further improve the respiratory prognosis for prematurely born children.

There are conflicting reports of plasma lipoprotein lipid content in dogs with diabetes mellitus (DM).


OBJECTIVES
To determine lipoprotein lipid content of plasma of dogs with DM by spectrophotometry and ultracentrifugation; to compare lipoprotein lipid content in diabetic and healthy dogs; and to quantify apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB) in dogs with DM.


ANIMALS
22 dogs with DM and 9 healthy dogs.


METHODS
Cross-sectional study. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry. Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations were calculated after ultracentrifugation. Non-HDL-C cholesterol was calculated by subtracting HDL-C from TC. ApoB was quantified by ELISA. The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of median lipoprotein concentrations, and Spearman's correlation was used to assess associations between ApoB and lipoprotein fractions.


RESULTS
All values are reported in mg/dL. Median TG (122), TC (343.5), HDL-C, (200), VLDL-C, (27) LDL-C (68), non-HDL-C (114), and ApoB (320) were significantly higher in dogs with DM, compared to healthy dogs (57, 197, 168, 12, 16, 31, and 258, respectively, P-values 0.0079, <0.001, 0.029, 0.011, <0.001, <0.001, 0.025, respectively).

881,"Solid-state NMR has become a valuable tool for the characterization of both pure and formulated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, NMR generally suffers from poor sensitivity that often restricts NMR experiments to nuclei with favorable properties, concentrated samples and acquisition of 1D NMR spectra. Here we review how dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be applied to routinely enhance the sensitivity of solid-state NMR experiments by one to two orders of magnitude for both pure and formulated APIs. Sample preparation protocols for relayed DNP experiments and experiments on directly-doped APIs are detailed. Numerical spin diffusion models illustrate the dependence of relayed DNP enhancements on the relaxation properties and particle size of the solids and can be used for particle size determination when the other factors are known. We then describe the advanced solid-state NMR experiments that have been enabled by DNP and how they provide unique insight into the molecular and macroscopic structure of APIs. For example, with large sensitivity gains provided by DNP natural isotopic abundance 13 C-13 C DQ-SQ homonuclear correlation NMR spectra of pure APIs can be routinely acquired. DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR also enables solid-state NMR experiments with unreceptive quadrupolar nuclei such as 2 H, 14 N and 35 Cl that are commonly found in APIs. Applications of DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR for the molecular level characterization of low API load formulations such as commercial tablets and amorphous solid dispersions are described.

Recent advances in the field of acoustics and piezoelectric and ultrasound transducers have led to new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases. One method of treatment with ultrasonic waves is high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment, which is a thermal therapeutic method used to treat malignant tumors. Although a variety of treatment-planning strategies using ultrasonic waves have been investigated, little clinical success has been achieved. Computational modeling is a powerful tool for predicting device performance.


METHODS
The heating induced by a concave transducer with operating powers of 85 and 135 W was studied, and the experimental results presented in this article verify its applicability. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear acoustic field were performed by using the Westervelt and Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equations. Heat transfer was measured for the 2 operational powers, and the results were compared with ex vivo experimental results. In addition, thermal dose contours for both the simulation and experimental results were calculated to investigate the ablated area.


RESULTS
Good agreement was found between the experimental and numerical results. The results show that the average temperature deviations calculated at the focal point were 12.8% and 4.3% for transducer powers of 85 and 135 W, respectively.

Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by esophagectomy is a well-known treatment modality for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC). We developed an algorithm to predict pathologic complete response (CR) in these patients using post-CRT endoscopic category with biopsy, and validated the proposed algorithm.


METHODS
A retrospective review of 141 consecutive patients who completed preoperative CRT and underwent surgical resection for locally advanced EC was performed. The post-CRT endoscopic findings of each patient were stratified into 5 categories.


RESULTS
The distribution of post-CRT endoscopic categories was significantly different between the pathologic CR and non-pathologic CR groups (P < 0.001). 76.8% (73/95) of patients in category 0, 1, or 2 achieved pathologic CR. In contrast, 91.3% (42/46) of endoscopic category 3 and 4 patients did not achieve pathologic CR. Sensitivity of post-CRT biopsy was 11.1%. Therefore, an algorithm combining biopsy results and dichotomized post-CRT endoscopic category (category 0, 1, or 2 vs. category 3 or 4) was developed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting pathologic CR by the proposed algorithm was 64.8%, 95.9%, and 82.8%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the proposed algorithm remained a significant negative factor of survival (P < 0.001).

This study evaluated the long-term effects of enteral glutamine supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes of a Dutch cohort of very preterm children at 13 years of age.


METHODS
The cohort was enrolled in a randomised placebo-controlled trial between 2001-2003 in which infants received glutamine- or alanine-supplemented enteral nutrition during the first month of life. Participants were invited for follow up at a mean age of 13.30 years. Motor, neurocognitive, academic and behavioural outcomes were assessed in 61 children.


RESULTS
No differences were found between the groups regarding motor, intellectual, academic and behavioural functioning. Forward span visuospatial working memory performance was better in the controls (crude/adjusted model: d = 0.67/0.64, p = 0.02/0.02), but no difference was found for backward span.

885,"The inflammasome is a multiprotein signaling complex that mediates inflammatory innate immune responses through caspase 1 activation and subsequent IL-1Î² secretion. Nonetheless, its aberrant activation often leads to inflammatory diseases. Therefore, targeting the inflammasome holds promise for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. Our study showed that a hot-water extract of Sanguisorba officinalis (HSO) effectively suppressed inflammasome activation triggered by ATP, nigericin, microbial pathogens, and dsDNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). HSO significantly suppressed IL-1Î² production in a dose-dependent manner; this effect correlated well with low levels of caspase 1 and ASC pyroptosome formation in HSO-treated cells. This anti-inflammatory activity of HSO was further confirmed in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced septic shock. Oral administration of HSO reduced the level of IL-1Î² in serum and in the peritoneal cavity, increasing the survival rate.

886,"Passive properties of the myocardium influence diastolic filling and cardiac output. In heart failure, changes in contributors to the passive properties of the ventricle, such as titin and collagen, and loss of the metabolic enzyme creatine kinase, increase resistance to filling resulting in diastolic dysfunction. Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) arises from interactions between the pulmonary vasculature and the right ventricle (RV) which ultimately leads to RV failure. Beta1-adrenergic receptor blockers (BB) act on the myocardium and are beneficial in left heart failure but are not used in PAH. We investigated whether BB improved survival and RV function in a rat model of PAH. Rats were injected with monocrotaline (60 mg/kg) to induce PAH and RV failure or saline as controls (CON). When PAH was established, rats were treated with metoprolol (10 mg/kg/day) (MCT+BB) or vehicle (sucrose) (MCT); CON were treated with vehicle. In vivo measurement of RV compliance using pressure-volume catheter, indicated diastolic dysfunction in the RV of MCT rats was improved with BB treatment. Expression of creatine kinase protein and mRNA was lower in MCT rats compared to CON, with a trend for reversion by BB treatment. Isolated CON RV myocytes had a positive contraction response to faster pacing, whereas it was negative in MCT. MCT+BB cells had an intermediate response, indicating improved ability to respond to increased demand. BB improved diastolic function, partially restored metabolic enzymes and augmented contractility in PAH. These data support the hypothesis that BB may be beneficial in PAH by supporting RV function.

The Drug Burden Index (DBI) is a dose-related measure of anticholinergic and sedative drug exposure. This cross-sectional study described DBI in older adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) and the most frequently reported therapeutic classes contributing to DBI and examined associations between higher DBI scores and potential adverse effects as well as physical function.


METHODS
This study analysed data from Wave 2 (2013/2014) of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA), a representative study on the ageing of people with ID in Ireland. Self- and objectively-reported data was collected on medication use and physical health, including health conditions. The Barthel Index was the physical function measure.


RESULTS
The study examined 677 individuals with ID, of which 644 (95.1%) reported taking medication and 78.6% (n = 532) were exposed to medication with anticholinergic and/or sedative activity. 54.2% (n = 367) were exposed to high DBI score (â‰¥1). Adjusted multivariate regression analysis revealed no significant association between DBI score and daytime dozing, constipation or falls. After adjusting for confounders (gender, age, level of ID, comorbidities, behaviours that challenge, history of falls), DBI was associated with significantly higher dependence in the Barthel Index (p = 0.002).

888,"Since the detection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in various environmental media, research has explored the potential uptake and toxicity of these chemicals into species inhabiting these matrices. Specifically, pharmaceuticals, including the antiepileptic API carbamazepine (CBZ), are taken up from soil by a range of plants. Many short term studies have also suggested that certain APIs induce toxicity in plants. However, effects of APIs on fruiting plants remains relatively unexplored. This study investigated the uptake, bioaccumulation and toxicity of CBZ in Cucurbita pepo (Zucchini) from seed to full maturity across a range of CBZ exposure concentrations in soil (0.1 to 20 mg/kg). Results of biomass, chlorophyll, starch and total nitrogen (N) concentration in C. pepo indicated toxicity at soil concentrations of â‰¥ 10 mg/kg. There were clear visual indications of increasing toxicity on leaves, including chlorosis and necrosis, from soil concentrations of 1 mg/kg up to 20 mg/kg. This study also revealed novel insights into the effect of CBZ accumulation on C. pepo fruiting, as female C. pepo flowers were unable to set fruit when leaf concentrations were â‰¥ 14 mg/kg. These findings may have implications for future agricultural productivity in areas where reclaimed wastewater containing APIs is a source of irrigation.

A retrospective study of public hospital EDs in Queensland, Australia, was undertaken for 2013-2014. The ED and hospital characteristics are described to evaluate the alignment between activity and resourcing levels and their impact on performance.


RESULTS
Twenty EDs participated (74% response rate). Weighted activity units (WAUs) and nursing staff varied based on hospital type and size. Larger hospital EDs had on average 9076 WAUs and 13 full time equivalent (FTE) nursing staff per 1000 WAUs; smaller EDs had on average 4587 WAUs and 10.3 FTE nursing staff per 1000 WAUs. Medical staff was relatively consistent (8.1-8.7 FTE per 1000 WAUs). The proportion of patients admitted, discharged, or transferred within 4Â hours ranged from 73% to 79%. The ED medical and nursing staffing numbers did not correlate with the 4-hour performance.


CONCLUSION
Substantial variation exists across Queensland EDs when resourcing service delivery in an activity-based funding environment. Historical inequity persists in the staffing profiles for regional and outer metropolitan departments. The lack of association between resourcing and performance metrics provides opportunity for further investigation of efficient models of care.",England,The International journal of health planning and management,29193286,2017,Understanding ED performance after the implementation of activity-based funding.,n
890,"PURPOSE
Although 1 H spin coupling is generally avoided in probes for hyperpolarized (HP) 13 C MRI, enzymatic transformations of biological interest can introduce large 13 C-1 H couplings in vivo. The purpose of this study was to develop and investigate the application of 1 H decoupling for enhancing the sensitivity for detection of affected HP 13 C metabolic products.


METHODS
A standalone 1 H decoupler system and custom concentric 13 C/1 H paddle coil setup were integrated with a clinical 3T MRI scanner for in vivo 13 C MR studies using HP [2-13 C]dihydroxyacetone, a novel sensor of hepatic energy status. Major 13 C-1 H coupling JCH â€‰=â€‰âˆ¼150â€‰Hz) is introduced after adenosine triphosphate-dependent enzymatic transformation of HP [2-13 C]dihydroxyacetone to [2-13 C]glycerol-3-phosphate in vivo. Application of WALTZ-16 1 H decoupling for elimination of large 13 C-1 H couplings was first tested in thermally polarized glycerol phantoms and then for in vivo HP MR studies in three rats, scanned both with and without decoupling.


RESULTS
As configured, 1 H-decoupled 13 C MR of thermally polarized glycerol and the HP metabolic product [2-13 C]glycerol-3-phosphate was achieved at forward power of approximately 15 W. High-quality 3-s dynamic in vivo HP 13 C MR scans were acquired with decoupling duty cycle of 5%. Application of 1 H decoupling resulted in sensitivity enhancement of 1.7-fold for detection of metabolic conversion of [2-13 C]dihydroxyacetone to HP [2-13 C]glycerol-3-phosphate in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
Application of 1 H decoupling provides significant sensitivity enhancement for detection of HP 13 C metabolic products with large 1 H spin couplings, and is therefore expected to be useful for preclinical and potentially clinical HP 13 C MR studies.

891,"PURPOSE
To investigate the use of natural dextrans as nano-sized chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI probes for characterizing size-dependent tumor vascular permeability.


METHODS
Dextrans of different molecular weight (10, 70, 150, and 2000 kD) were characterized for their CEST contrast. Mice (Nâ€‰=â€‰5) bearing CT26 subcutaneous colon tumors were injected intravenously with 10 kD (D10, 6â€‰nm) and 70 kD (D70, 12â€‰nm) dextran at a dose of 375â€‰mg/kg. The CEST-MRI signal in the tumors was assessed before and approximately 40â€‰min after each injection using a dynamic CEST imaging scheme.


RESULTS
All dextrans of different molecular weights have a strong CEST signal with an apparent maximum of approximately 0.9â€‰ppm. The detectability and effects of pH and saturation conditions (B1 and Tsat ) were investigated. When applied to CT26 tumors, the injection of D10 could produce a significant ""dexCEST"" enhancement in the majority of the tumor area, whereas the injection of D70 only resulted in an increase in the tumor periphery. Quantitative analysis revealed the differential permeability of CT26 tumors to different size particles, which was validated by fluorescence imaging and immunohistochemistry.


CONCLUSIONS
As a first application, we used 10- and 70-kD dextrans to visualize the spatially variable, size-dependent permeability in the tumor, indicating that nano-sized dextrans can be used for characterizing tumor vascular permeability with dexCEST MRI and, potentially, for developing dextran-based theranostic drug delivery systems.

Women seen in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) face high rates of both IPV and mental health morbidity. This study aimed to identify associations between recent IPV experience and mental health diagnoses among women VHA patients. We examined medical records data for 8,888 female veteran and nonveteran VHA patients across 13 VHA facilities who were screened for past-year IPV between April, 2014 and April, 2016. Compared with women who screened negative for past-year IPV (IPV-), those who screened positive (IPV+; 8.7%) were more than twice as likely to have a mental health diagnosis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.95, 2.64]; or more than two mental health diagnoses, AOR = 2.29, 95% CI [1.93, 2.72]). Screening IPV+ was also associated with significantly higher odds of each type of mental health morbidity (AOR range = 1.85-3.19) except psychoses. Over half (53.5%) of the women who screened IPV+ had a mental health diagnosis, compared with fewer than one-third (32.6%) of those who screened IPV-. Each subtype of IPV (psychological, physical, and sexual violence) was significantly associated with having a mental health diagnosis (AOR range = 2.25-2.37) or comorbidity (AOR range = 2.17-2.78). Associations remained when adjusting for military sexual trauma and combat trauma among the veteran subsample. These findings highlight the mental health burden associated with past-year IPV among female VHA patients and underscore the need to address psychological and sexual IPV, in addition to physical violence.",United States,Journal of traumatic stress,29193289,2017,Disproportionate Mental Health Burden Associated With Past-Year Intimate Partner Violence Among Women Receiving Care in the Veterans Health Administration.,y
893,"There was a significant amount of non-specific, but not of allergen (e.g., papain, mite feces, and 4 kinds of pollen)-specific, IgE antibodies (Abs) in the serum of normal mice. An intranasal (i.n.) injection of each allergen without adjuvant into mice caused an increase in total IgE Ab titers with a similar time course in the serum; but the stage in the initiation of allergy varied from allergen to allergen. Submandibular lymph node cells from normal mice contained papain-, but not mite feces- or pollen-specific IgE+ cells; and an i.n. injection of papain induced papain-specific IgE Abs in the serum. In contrast, 1 (i.n.) or 2 [i.n. and subcutaneous (s.c.)] injections of mite feces induced neither mite feces-specific IgE+ cells in the lymph nodes nor mite feces-specific IgE Abs in the serum.

894,"OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to validate and determine the reliability of the Portuguese version of the Summated Xerostomia Inventory.


BACKGROUND
Many conditions such as head and neck radiation, autoimmune diseases or polypharmacy are characterised by hyposalivation which can affect oral and systemic quality of life. As such, this condition must be assessed, and the English version of the Xerostomia Inventory has been increasingly used to determine the severity of dry mouth perception.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which employed volunteers suffering from hyposalivation after local ethical committee clearance. Each patient signed an informed consent and responded to the Portuguese version of the questionnaire in the form of an interview. This was repeated again after 2Â weeks. AÂ standard single question provided a validity check. Data were analysed using Cronbach's Î± to test its reliability and total and interitem correlation, and intraclass correlation to determine its internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Significance was set at .05.


RESULTS
A sample of 103 volunteers was recruited. Cronbach's Î± was .84 and .87 for the first and second test administrations, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient value for the test-retest reliability was .93, and scores for the individual items ranged from .79 to .90. The correlation between the total score of the questionnaire and standard single dry mouth question was .66, indicating a very good correlation.


CONCLUSION
Demonstrating excellent psychometric properties, the Summated Xerostomia Inventory (Portuguese Version) is a valid tool for quantifying Xerostomia in a dry mouth-afflicted population.",England,Gerodontology,29193291,2017,Validity and reliability of a Portuguese version of the Summated Xerostomia Inventory-5.,n
895,"For species at risk of decline or extinction in source-sink systems, sources are an obvious target for habitat protection actions. However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for three endangered species. Using empirically-based habitat-population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of time periods of data collection and prioritized the strongest sources for conservation. We then tested the ability of prioritized patches to identify the most habitats most affecting persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Our results indicated that conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection can impact species persistence. Shorter times series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. As source-sink metrics (i.e., births-deaths; births and immigrations - deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many non-equilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.

896,"Recent evidence suggests that the oral drug Fingolimod (FTY720) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) may act directly on the central nervous system (CNS) and modulate disease pathogenesis and progression in experimental models of MS. However, the specific subtype of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors that mediates the effect of FTY720 on the CNS cells has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) is elevated in reactive astrocytes in an autoimmunity independent mouse model of MS and that selective S1PR1 modulation is sufficient to ameliorate the loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination. The non-selective S1PR modulator, FTY720, or a short-lived S1PR1-specific modulator, CYM5442, was administered daily to mice while on cuprizone diet. Both FTY720- and CYM5422-treated mice displayed a significant reduction in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and astrocyte and microglial activation in comparison to vehicle-treated groups, which was associated with decreased production of proinflammatory mediators and down-regulation of astrocytic S1PR1 protein. Interestingly, S1PR1 modulation during the early phase of cuprizone intoxication was required to suppress oligodendrocyte death and consequent demyelination as drug treatment from 10 days after the initiation of cuprizone feeding was no longer effective. CYM5442 treatment during the brief cuprizone exposure significantly prevented Il-1Î², Il-6, Cxcl10, and Cxcl3 induction, resulting in suppression of subsequent reactive gliosis and demyelination. Our study identifies functional antagonism of S1PR1 as a major mechanism for the protective effect of FTY720 in the cuprizone model and suggests pathogenic contributions of astrocyte S1PR1 signaling in primary demyelination and its potential as a therapeutic target for CNS inflammation.",United States,Glia,29193293,2017,Functional antagonism of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 prevents cuprizone-induced demyelination.,n

901,"PURPOSE
Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+.


METHODS
Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income.


FINDINGS
In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional.

902,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a novel feature refinement MR reconstruction method from highly undersampled multichannel acquisitions for improving the image quality and preserve more detail information.


THEORY AND METHODS
The feature refinement technique, which uses a feature descriptor to pick up useful features from residual image discarded by sparsity constrains, is applied to preserve the details of the image in compressed sensing and parallel imaging in MRI (CS-pMRI). The texture descriptor and structure descriptor recognizing different types of features are required for forming the feature descriptor. Feasibility of the feature refinement was validated using three different multicoil reconstruction methods on in vivo data.


RESULTS
Experimental results show that reconstruction methods with feature refinement improve the quality of reconstructed image and restore the image details more accurately than the original methods, which is also verified by the lower values of the root mean square error and high frequency error norm.


CONCLUSION
A simple and effective way to preserve more useful detailed information in CS-pMRI is proposed. This technique can effectively improve the reconstruction quality and has superior performance in terms of detail preservation compared with the original version without feature refinement.

Behavior or fitness regulation of insect by modulating the Troponin C (TnC) may be a novel strategy in the comprehensive management of the insect pest. However, characterizations and functions of TnC, especially regarding effect of its RNA interference-mediated gene knockdown on the behavior or fitness of N. cincticeps remain unknown. Here, we successfully cloned and characterized TnC gene from N. cincticeps (Nc-TnC). We demonstrated that Nc-TnC ubiquitously transcribed at all development stages and special tissues in adult insects, with relative higher levels at the adult stage and in the intestinal canal. Microinjection- or oral membrane feeding-based transient knockdown of Nc-TnC adversely affected the performance or fitness, such as the decreased survival, feeding capacity, weight, and fecundity of N. cincticeps. Furthermore, we revealed that the expression of Nc-TnC was suppressed by its interaction with rice dwarf virus-encoded nonstructural protein 10, which ultimately affected detrimentally the corresponding parameters of the performance or fitness of N. cincticeps. In conclusion, our data deepen understanding of Nc-TnC functions during the development of and viral infection in N. cincticeps.

The contribution of gut-derived factors to the mechanisms linking obesity and metabolic disease remain under-investigated. The aim of the current study was examine the associations between glucagon and enteroendocrine signaling and type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a derived risk score approach. To compare the relative importance of the enteroendocrine system, associations between adipokine measures and T2D were also investigated METHODS: A total of 130 individuals with T2D and 161 individuals without T2D were included in the study. Circulating concentrations of enteroendocrine (glucagon, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide) and adipokine mediators (adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, adipsin) were measured. Standard scores (Z-scores) were determined for each measure and enteroendocrine (ERS) and adipokine (ARS) risk scores calculated based on summation of the component measures. Associations between both the ERS and ARS and T2D status were assessed using logistic regression models.


RESULTS
The ERS was significantly associated with T2D status in an adjusted model (OR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.08-1.72; p=0.009). Associations between the ARS and T2D status were not independent of age, sex and BMI (OR: 1.21; 95%CI: 0.99-1.47; p=0.06). Quantification of risk across ERS tertiles revealed that individuals with an ERS in the upper tertile were 10 times more likely (CI: 3.23-32.73; p<0.001) to have T2D.

METHODS
Medical records (1990-2014) of two referral centres were reviewed for signalment, diagnostic features, method of treatment (medical, surgical or both) and outcome.


RESULTS
The median age of horses was 13 years (range 5-22 years) and follow-up time ranged from 12 to 108 months. Fourteen horses were treated medically and 20 horses were treated surgically. Of those horses treated medically, 4 horses had recurrence of clinical signs requiring subsequent surgical treatment. Overall, 41.7% of horses had recurrence of clinical signs following treatment and 66.7% of horses were able to return to their previous level of exercise. Five horses underwent more than one surgical procedure due to recurrence of clinical signs. Of those horses treated solely surgically, 28.6% of the horses had recurrence of clinical signs and 78.6% returned to their previous level of exercise.

907,"The aim of this paper was to evaluate strategies for periodontal therapy from the perspective of periodontal disease being a consequence of microbial colonization of the periodontal pocket environment. In classic bacterial infections the diversity of the microbiota decreases as the disease develops. In most cases of periodontitis, however, the diversity of the flora increases. Most incriminating bacteria are thought to harm tissues significantly only if present in high numbers over prolonged periods of time. Clinical trials have repeatedly demonstrated that scaling and root planing, a procedure that aims to remove subgingival bacterial deposits by scraping on the tooth surface within the periodontal pocket, is effective. At present, for the therapy of any form of periodontal disease, there exists no protocol with proven superiority, in terms of efficiency or effectiveness, over scaling and root planing plus systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole. Some exponents advocate rationing these drugs for patients with a specific microbial profile. However, the evidence for any benefit of bacteriology-assisted clinical protocols is unsatisfactory. Treated sites are subject to recolonization with a microbiota similar to that present before therapy. The degree and speed of recolonization depends on the treatment protocol, the distribution patterns of periodontal microorganisms elsewhere in the oral cavity and the quality of the patient's oral hygiene. To limit the use of antibiotics and to avoid accumulation of harmful effects by repeated therapy, further efforts must be made to optimize procedures addressing the microbial colonization and recolonization of the periodontal pocket.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193304,2017,Microbial colonization of the periodontal pocket and its significance for periodontal therapy.,n

We hypothesized that the interactions between dendritic cells and EDN might be of importance in the disease development. Cellular content of EDN was analyzed by ELISA. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 405, 416, and 1122 in the EDN gene were analyzed by real-time PCR with TaqManÂ® reagents. The study cohorts comprised 239 Sudanese subjects (65 healthy controls and 174 with VL) and 300 healthy Swedish controls. The eosinophil content of EDN was lower in VL as compared with controls (p < 0.0001). The EDN405 (G>C) genotype distribution was similar among Swedish and Sudanese controls, whereas VL subjects had a higher prevalence of the EDN405-GG genotype (p < 0.0001). The content of EDN in the eosinophils was closely linked to the EDN405 polymorphism (p = 0.0002).

909,"PURPOSE
To investigate the feasibility of using artificial neural networks to estimate stiffness from MR elastography (MRE) data.


METHODS
Artificial neural networks were fit using model-based training patterns to estimate stiffness from images of displacement using a patch size of âˆ¼1â€‰cm in each dimension. These neural network inversions (NNIs) were then evaluated in a set of simulation experiments designed to investigate the effects of wave interference and noise on NNI accuracy. NNI was also tested in vivo, comparing NNI results against currently used methods.


RESULTS
In 4 simulation experiments, NNI performed as well or better than direct inversion (DI) for predicting the known stiffness of the data. Summary NNI results were also shown to be significantly correlated with DI results in the liver (R2 â€‰=â€‰0.974) and in the brain (R2 â€‰=â€‰0.915), and also correlated with established biological effects including fibrosis stage in the liver and age in the brain. Finally, repeatability error was lower in the brain using NNI compared to DI, and voxel-wise modeling using NNI stiffness maps detected larger effects than using DI maps with similar levels of smoothing.


CONCLUSION
Artificial neural networks represent a new approach to inversion of MRE data. Summary results from NNI and DI are highly correlated and both are capable of detecting biologically relevant signals. Preliminary evidence suggests that NNI stiffness estimates may be more resistant to noise than an algebraic DI approach. Taken together, these results merit future investigation into NNIs to improve the estimation of stiffness in small regions. Magn Reson Med, 2017.

910,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of integrated high-permittivity materials (HPMs) on excitation homogeneity and global specific absorption rate (SAR) for transmit arrays at 7T.


METHODS
A rapid electrodynamic simulation framework was used to calculate L-curves associated with excitation of a uniform 2D profile in a dielectric sphere. We used ultimate intrinsic SAR as an absolute performance reference to compare different transmit arrays in the presence and absence of a layer of HPM. We investigated the optimal permittivity for the HPM as a function of its thickness, the sample size, and the number of array elements.


RESULTS
Adding a layer of HPM can improve the performance of a 24-element array to match that of a 48-element array without HPM, whereas a 48-element array with HPM can perform as well as a 64-element array without HPM. Optimal relative permittivity values changed based on sample and coil geometry, but were always within a range obtainable with readily available materials (Îµr â€‰=â€‰100-200).


CONCLUSION
Integration of HPMs could be a practical method to improve RF shimming performance, alternative to increasing the number of coils.

Samples were assessed using light microscopy, mechanical testing, and microcomputed tomography. Variables evaluated included microstructural features such as number, size, and density of Haversian canals, resorption cavities and osteocytic lacunae, bone mineral density, porosity and Young's modulus.


RESULTS
Median lacunae size was significantly smaller in the CKD group compared to the control group (P = 0.001). Resorption cavity density was higher in the CKD compared to the control group (10 [8-14] vs. 7 [4-9]/mm2 , respectively, P = 0.001). Overall porosity was significantly (2.3-fold) higher in the CKD compared to the control group. There was no difference in Young's moduli between groups.


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE
Naturally occurring CKD affects bone quality in dogs, but these changes are relatively mild and likely not to be manifested clinically. The duration of the disease in dogs evaluated here is short compared to cats and human patients, likely accounting for the more subtle changes in dogs compared to other species.",United States,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,29193308,2017,The Influence of Chronic Kidney Disease on the Structural and Mechanical Properties of Canine Bone.,n
912,"Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures and abnormal electrical activity in the brain, is one of the most prevalent brain disorders. Over two million people in the United States have been diagnosed with epilepsy and 3% of the general population will be diagnosed with it at some point in their lives. While most developmental epilepsies occur due to genetic predisposition, a class of ""acquired"" epilepsies results from a variety of brain insults. A leading etiological factor for epilepsy that is currently on the rise is traumatic brain injury (TBI), which accounts for up to 20% of all symptomatic epilepsies. Remarkably, the presence of an identified early insult that constitutes a risk for development of epilepsy provides a therapeutic window in which the pathological processes associated with brain injury can be manipulated to limit the subsequent development of recurrent seizure activity and epilepsy. Recent studies have revealed diverse pathologies, including enhanced excitability, activated immune signaling, cell death, and enhanced neurogenesis within a week after injury, suggesting a period of heightened adaptive and maladaptive plasticity. An integrated understanding of these processes and their cellular and molecular underpinnings could lead to novel targets to arrest epileptogenesis after trauma. This review attempts to highlight and relate the diverse early changes after trauma and their role in development of epilepsy and suggests potential strategies to limit neurological complications in the injured brain.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193309,2017,Converging early responses to brain injury pave the road to epileptogenesis.,y
913,"The signaling network involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not yet fully understood. This review aims to describe possible mechanisms through which the bacterial modulators may be linked directly or indirectly to the process of alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. From the late 1970s to present, new paradigm shifts have been developed regarding our understanding of pathological bone remodeling in periodontal disease. Upcoming evidence suggests that in periodontal disease the local immune response is exacerbated and involves the existence of signaling pathways that have been shown to modulate bone-cell function leading to alveolar bone loss. Those complex signaling pathways have been observed not only between bacteria but also between bacteria and the gingival surface of the host. More specifically, it has been shown that bacteria, through their secretion molecules, may interact indirectly and directly with immune-type cells of the host, resulting in the production of osteolytic agents that enhance bone resorption. Further research is required to provide a clear understanding of the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, and the availability of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis, may be useful tools in achieving this.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193310,2017,Bacterial modulators of bone remodeling in the periodontal pocket.,y
914,"Detection of breast cancer (BC) in young women is challenging because mammography, the most common tool for detecting BC, is not effective on the dense breast tissue characteristic of young women. In addition to the limited means for detecting their BC, young women face a transient increased risk of pregnancy-associated BC. As a consequence, reproductively active women could benefit significantly from a tool that provides them with accurate risk assessment and early detection of BC. One potential method for detection of BC is biochemical monitoring of proteins and other molecules in bodily fluids such as serum, nipple aspirate, ductal lavage, tear, urine, saliva and breast milk. Of all these fluids, only breast milk provides access to a large volume of breast tissue, in the form of exfoliated epithelial cells, and to the local breast environment, in the form of molecules in the milk. Thus, analysis of breast milk is a non-invasive method with significant potential for assessing BC risk. Here we analyzed human breast milk by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to build a biomarker signature for early detection of BC. Ten milk samples from 8 women provided 5 paired-groups (cancer versus control) for analysis of dysregulatedproteins: 2 within woman comparisons (milk from a diseased breast versus a healthy breast of the same woman) and 3 across women comparisons (milk from a woman with cancer versus a woman without cancer). Despite a wide range in the time between milk donation and cancer diagnosis (cancer diagnosis occurred from 1 month before to 24 months after milk donation), the levels of some proteins differed significantly between cancer and control in several of the 5 comparison groups. These pilot data are supportive of the idea that molecular analysis of breast milk will identify proteins informative for early detection and accurate assessment of BC risk, and warrant further research.

915,"Intracortical bone remodeling normally ensures maintenance of the cortical bone matrix and strength, but during aging, this remodeling generates excessive porosity. The mechanism behind the age-induced cortical porosity is poorly understood and addressed in the present study. This study consists of a histomorphometric analysis of sections of iliac bone specimens from 35 women (age 16-78 years). Firstly, the study shows that the aging-induced cortical porosity reflects an increased pore size rather than an increased pore density. Secondly, it establishes a novel histomorphometric classification of the pores, which is based on the characteristics of the remodeling sites to which each pore is associated. It takes into consideration (i) the stage of the remodeling event at the level where the pore is sectioned, (ii) whether the event corresponds with the generation of a new pore through penetrative tunneling (type 1 pores) or with remodeling of an existing pore (type 2 pores), and (iii) in the latter case, whether or not the new remodeling event leads to the coalescence of pores. Of note, the advantage of this classification is to relate porosity with its generation mechanism. Thirdly, it demonstrates that aging and porosity are correlated with: a shift from type 1 to type 2 pores, reflecting that the remodeling of existing pores is higher; an accumulation of eroded type 2 pores, reflecting an extended resorption-reversal phase; and a coalescence of these eroded type 2 pores into enlarged osteon coalescing type 2 cavities. Collectively, this study supports the notion, that age-related increase in cortical porosity is the result of intracortical remodeling sites upon existing pores, with an extended reversal-resorption phase (eroded type 2 pores) that may likely result in a delayed or absent initiation of the subsequent bone formation.

916,"U.S. guidelines recommend BRCA1/2 mutation testing for women diagnosed with high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) to increase recognition of carriers, but most remain unidentified and at risk. Accordingly, an approach termed ""Traceback"" has been proposed in which probands are retrospectively identified by testing archived pathology specimens, and family members are traced to provide genetic counseling and testing. We used population-based data to estimate the number of family members who might be contacted through such a program. We used incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program to estimate the number of women diagnosed with HGOC from 2005 to 2016, and census data to estimate the number of spouses, offspring, and siblings (both sexes). Using overall survival for HGOC from SEER and all-cause mortality rates from the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, we estimated the number of patients, spouses, offspring, and siblings of HGOC cases living in 2017. Due to the high mortality rate of HGOC, consent from living probands may be possible in only 42% of the cases; consent to test pathology specimens would need to be sought from next of kin for the remainder. In 2017, an estimated 406,919 living next of kin (spouses, siblings, offspring) would be available for potential consent. Testing archived ovarian cancer pathology specimens may enable the identification of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, but consent from next of kin would be required in in 58% of cases.

917,"Balance training programs have been shown to reduce ankle sprain injuries in sports, but little is known about the transfer from this training modality to motor coordination and ankle joint biomechanics in sport specific movements. This study aimed to investigate the effects of wobble board training on motor coordination and ankle mechanics during early single-leg landing from a lateral jump. Twenty-two healthy men were randomly assigned to either a control or a training group, who engaged in four weeks of wobble board training. Full-body kinematics, ground reaction force and surface electromyography (EMG) from 12 lower limb muscles were recorded during landing. Ankle joint work in the sagittal, frontal and transverse plane were calculated from 0-100 ms after landing. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was applied on the concatenated EMG Pre- and Post-intervention. Wobble board training increased the ankle joint eccentric work 1.2 times in the frontal (p<0.01) and 4.4 times in the transverse plane (p<0.01) for trained participants. Wobble board training modified the modular organization of muscle recruitment in the early landing phase by separating the activation of plantar flexors and medio-lateral ankle stabilizers. Furthermore, the activation of secondary muscles across motor modules was reduced after training, refocusing the activation on the main muscles involved on the mechanical main sub-functions for each module. These results suggest that wobble board training may modify motor coordination when landing from a lateral jump, focusing on the recruitment of specific muscles/muscle groups that optimize ankle joint stability during early ground contact in single-leg landing.

919,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies.

The core focus of the project entailed a nurse and a Cooperative Extension Educator co-teaching trauma-informed parenting classes to rural dwelling, kinship caregivers. Kinship caregivers are often grandparents who assume the parenting role after the child has been removed from the birth parents' care. The trauma-informed curriculum was developed by experts in child trauma and is available through the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. The unique partnership provided insight into the different missions of the two organizations, different values and workflow metrics, and different schedules, which at times proved to be barriers to implementation.

923,"BACKGROUND
Children with deprivation amblyopia due to childhood cataract have been excluded from much of the emerging research into amblyopia treatment. An investigation was conducted to determine whether contrast-balanced binocular treatment - a strategy currently being explored for children with anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia - may be effective in children with deprivation amblyopia.


METHODS
An unmasked, case-series design intended to assess proof of principle was employed. Eighteen children with deprivation amblyopia due to childhood cataracts (early bilateral nâ€‰=â€‰7, early unilateral nâ€‰=â€‰7, developmental nâ€‰=â€‰4), as well as 10 children with anisometropic (nâ€‰=â€‰8) or mixed anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia (nâ€‰=â€‰2) were prescribed one hour a day of treatment over a six-week period. Supervised treatment was available. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, global motion perception and interocular suppression were measured pre- and post-treatment.


RESULTS
Visual acuity improvements occurred in the anisometropic/strabismic group (0.15â€‰Â±â€‰0.05 logMAR, pâ€‰=â€‰0.014), but contrast sensitivity did not change. As a group, children with deprivation amblyopia had a smaller but statistically significant improvement in weaker eye visual acuity (0.09â€‰Â±â€‰0.03 logMAR, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), as well a significant improvement in weaker eye contrast sensitivity (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). Subgroup analysis suggested that the children with early bilateral deprivation had the largest improvements, while children with early unilateral cataract did not improve. Interestingly, binocular contrast sensitivity also improved in children with early bilateral deprivation. Global motion perception improved for both subgroups with early visual deprivation, as well as children with anisometropic or mixed anisometropic/strabismic amblyopia. Interocular suppression improved for all subgroups except children with early unilateral deprivation.


CONCLUSION
These data suggest that supervised contrast-balanced binocular treatment should be further investigated as a treatment option for children with deprivation amblyopia.

There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend vision screening for children < 36â€‰months of age. This study assessed the effect of comprehensive vision screening, as well as the sensitivity of age-appropriate vision tests, at two years of age on habitual visual acuity at 4.5â€‰years of age.


METHODS
Children born at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (nâ€‰=â€‰477) underwent vision assessment at 54â€‰Â±â€‰2â€‰months of age including measurement of monocular and binocular habitual visual acuity, assessment of binocularity and stereopsis. Of these children, 355 (74.4 per cent) had also received vision screening at two years of age (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰24Â±â€‰1â€‰months), while 122 were not screened.


RESULTS
Eighty (16.8 per cent) children were classified as having reduced vision at 4.5â€‰years of age, but the prevalence of reduced vision did not differ between children who had previously been screened at two years of age and those who had not (15.5 per cent versus 20.5 per cent, pâ€‰=â€‰0.153). However, children with reduced vision at 4.5â€‰years of age were more likely to have had visual abnormalities requiring referral detected at two years of age (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). Visual acuity and mean spherical equivalent autorefraction measurements were also worse (higher values) in two-year-old children who were later classified with reduced habitual visual acuity (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, respectively). Nevertheless, unaided binocular visual acuity, non-cycloplegic refractive error, and stereopsis at two years all showed poor sensitivity and specificity for predicting visual outcomes at 4.5â€‰years of age.

927,"Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a hyperpolarisation technique that catalytically transfers nuclear polarisation from parahydrogen, the singlet nuclear isomer of H2 , to a substrate in solution. The SABRE exchange reaction is carried out in a polarisation transfer field (PTF) of tens of gauss before transfer to a stronger magnetic field for NMR detection. In the simplest implementation, polarisation transfer is achieved by shaking the sample in the stray field of a superconducting NMR magnet. While convenient, this method suffers from limited reproducibility and cannot be used with NMR spectrometers that do not have appreciable stray fields, such as benchtop instruments. Here we use a simple hand-held permanent magnet array to provide the necessary PTF during sample shaking. We find that the use of this array provides a 25% increase in SABRE enhancement over the stray field approach, while also providing improved reproducibility. Arrays with a range of PTFs were tested and the PTF-dependent SABRE enhancements were found to be in excellent agreement with comparable experiments carried out using an automated flow system where an electromagnet is used to generate the PTF. We anticipate that this approach will improve the efficiency and reproducibility of SABRE experiments carried out using manual shaking and will be particularly useful for benchtop NMR, where a suitable stray field is not readily accessible. The ability to construct arrays with a range of PTFs will also enable the rapid optimisation of SABRE enhancement as function of PTF for new substrate and catalyst systems.",England,Magnetic resonance in chemistry : MRC,29193324,2017,A simple hand-held magnet array for efficient and reproducible SABRE hyperpolarisation using manual sample shaking.,n

Thyroid dysfunction is associated with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in people.


HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES
To determine whether dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis occurs in dogs receiving the TKI, toceranib phosphate.


ANIMALS
Forty-three client-owned dogs with cancer.


METHODS
Prospective, observational study. Concentrations of total thyroxine (TT4), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were evaluated on day 0, 30, and 90. Dogs also were evaluated for the presence of thyroglobulin autoantibodies.


RESULTS
The proportion of dogs with low TT4, low FT4, low TT3, high TSH, or primary hypothyroidism (increased TSH and decreased TT4, FT4 or both) did not change over 90 days. Hormone concentrations remained within laboratory reference intervals, but FT4 (P = 0.0032) and TSH (P < 0.0001) changed over time. Mean FT4 was 1.22 ng/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.34) on day 0 and 1.00 ng/dL (95% CI, 0.86-1.16) on day 90. Mean TSH was 0.17 ng/mL (95% CI, 0.13-0.23) on day 0 and 0.34 ng/mL (95% CI, 0.24-0.48) on day 90. Furthermore, TT4/TT3 ratio also changed over time (P = 0.0086).

934,"Host modulation therapy refers to a treatment concept in which drug therapies are used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal treatment to ameliorate destructive aspects of the host inflammatory response. This strategy is not new in the treatment of periodontitis. Previously, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been investigated in this regard, with evidence of reductions in alveolar bone resorption when these drugs are used for prolonged periods of time. However, the risk of significant unwanted effects precludes the use of both nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors as adjunctive treatments for periodontitis. Currently, the only available adjunctive host response modulator that is licensed for the treatment of periodontitis is subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, which functions as an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases. Although clinical benefits have been shown in carefully conducted randomized controlled trials, the efficacy of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline in routine clinical practice has yet to be determined. Anti-cytokine therapies have been developed for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the pathogenesis of which bears many similarities to that of periodontitis; however, the significant risk of unwanted effects (as well as cost and lack of human trials in the treatment of periodontal diseases) precludes the use of any of the currently available anti-cytokine therapies in the treatment of periodontitis.

Patients undergoing a ReClip procedure in our institution were retrospectively identified. Baseline data and the procedural outcome were assessed to identify potential limitations of such procedures.


RESULTS
Fifteen out of 234 patients undergoing a mitral-valve repair with the MitraClip device (Abbott Vascular) underwent a ReClip due to recurrent MR. In 11 patients, a MR reduction of at least one degree without causing mitral valve stenosis (trans-mitral mean gradient â‰¥5â€‰mmHg) was achieved by performing a ReClip. After 1 year, two patients developed severe recurrent MR again. Pulmonary artery pressures significantly decreased after the procedure in individuals with successful repair (MR reduction of at least one degree and mitral valve mean gradient <5â€‰mmHg).


CONCLUSION
A ReClip procedure may be feasible in patients with recurrent MR but the risk benefit ratio should be carefully balanced against other treatment options.",United States,Journal of interventional cardiology,29193333,2017,Repeated MitraClip procedure in patients with recurrent MR after a successful first procedure: Limitations and outcome.,n
937,"The integrity of the peri-implant soft-tissue seal is crucial for maintaining peri-implant tissue health. Whilst the transmucosal component of the restored implant shares some common features with teeth, namely the presence of a junctional epithelium and a connective tissue component, there are some important differences. A key difference is the nature of the relationship of the connective tissue with the implant surface, whereby there is 'adaptation' of collagen fibers in a parallel orientation in relation to the implant, but insertion of fiber attachment perpendicularly into cementum in the case of teeth. This, combined with reduced cellularity and vascularity in the peri-implant connective tissue, may make implants more susceptible to disease initiation and progression. Furthermore, the presence of a subgingival connection between the implant and the abutment/restoration poses some specific challenges, and maintaining the integrity of this connection is important in preserving peri-implant tissue health. Implant design features, such as the nature of the connection between the implant and the abutment, as well as the surface characteristics of the abutment and implants, may influence the maintenance of the integrity of soft tissue around implants. Iatrogenic factors, such as incorrect seating of the abutment and/or the restoration, and the presence of residual subgingival cement, will lead to loss of soft-tissue integrity and hence predispose to peri-implant disease.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193334,2017,Comparison of peri-implant and periodontal marginal soft tissues in health and disease.,n

The aim of this study was to assess clinical benefit of the Echo-guided ProGlide technique in patients undergoing percutaneous transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI).


BACKGROUND
The efficacy of the Echo-guided ProGlide technique during percutaneous TF-TAVI was not previously clarified.


METHODS
A total of 121 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous TF-TAVI at our institution between February 2014 and July 2017 were enrolled in this study. According to the introduction of this novel technique in March 2016, patients were divided into two groups (echo-guided group who underwent TAVI from March 2016 to July 2017, nâ€‰=â€‰63; not echo-guided group who underwent TAVI from February 2014 to February 2016, nâ€‰=â€‰58). The incidence of major vascular complications, defined per the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria, and ProGlide complications including acute femoral artery stenosis or occlusion and bleeding requiring any intervention.


RESULTS
The incidence of major vascular complication and ProGlide complication were significantly lower in the echo-guided group than in not echo-guided group (1.6% vs 17.2%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.002; 1.6% vs 15.5%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003; respectively). Use of the Echo-guided ProGlide technique was independently associated with prevention of ProGlide complications (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidential interval, 0.01-0.76; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03).


CONCLUSIONS

941,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the longitudinal association of dual and single (vision and hearing) sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults.


METHODS
Two thousand eight hundred ninety adults aged 60Â years or over who participated in the longitudinal population-based TromsÃ¸ Study, Norway, were included. The impact of objective vision loss, self-report hearing loss, or dual sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety, as assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 10, was examined at baseline and 6-year follow-up using linear mixed models.


RESULTS
Hearing loss had a cross-sectional relationship with increased depression (bÂ =Â 0.1750, SEÂ =Â 0.07, PÂ =Â .02) and anxiety symptoms (bÂ =Â 0.1765, SEÂ =Â 0.08, PÂ =Â .03); however, these relationships were not significant at the 6-year follow-up. Both vision loss only and dual sensory loss predicted increased depression scores at follow-up (bÂ =Â 0.0220, SEÂ =Â 0.01, PÂ =Â .03; and bÂ =Â 0.0413, SEÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Adjustment for social isolation did not attenuate the main depression results.


CONCLUSION
Dual sensory loss resulted in increased depression symptomatology over time and posed an additional long-term risk to depression severity beyond having a single sensory loss only. Only hearing loss is associated with anxiety symptoms. Older adults with vision, hearing, and dual sensory loss have different mental health profiles. Therefore, management and intervention should be tailored to the type of sensory loss.",England,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,29193338,2017,"The association amongst visual, hearing, and dual sensory loss with depression and anxiety over 6Â years: The TromsÃ¸ Study.",y
942,"PURPOSE
Dynamic manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) allows assessment of tissue viability by tracing manganese uptake. We aimed to develop a rapid T1 mapping method for dynamic MEMRI to facilitate assessments of murine kidney viability.


METHODS
A multi-slice saturation recovery fast spin echo (MSRFSE) was developed, validated, and subsequently applied in dynamic MEMRI at 16.4T on ischemic mouse kidneys after 4 weeks of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Baseline T1 values and post-contrast R1 (1/T1 ) changes were measured in cortex (CO), outer (OSOM), inner (ISOM) strips of outer medulla, and inner medulla (IM).


RESULTS
Validation studies showed strong agreement between MSRFSE and an established saturation recovery Look-Locker method. Baseline T1 (s) increased in the stenotic kidney CO (2.10 [1.95-2.56] vs. 1.88 [1.81-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0317) and OSOM (2.17 [2.05-2.33] vs. 1.96 [1.87-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0075) but remained unchanged in ISOM and IM. This method allowed a temporal resolution of 1.43â€‰min in dynamic MEMRI. Mn2+ uptake and retention decreased in stenotic kidneys, particularly in the OSOM (Î”R1 : 0.48 [0.38-0.56] vs. 0.64 [0.61-0.69] s-1 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).

943,"PURPOSE
In typical MRI protocols, time is spent acquiring a field map to calculate the shim settings for best image quality. We propose a fast template-based field map prediction method that yields near-optimal shims without measuring the field.


METHODS
The template-based prediction method uses prior knowledge of the B0 distribution in the human brain, based on a large database of field maps acquired from different subjects, together with subject-specific structural information from a quick localizer scan. The shimming performance of using the template-based prediction is evaluated in comparison to a range of potential fast shimming methods.


RESULTS
Static B0 shimming based on predicted field maps performed almost as well as shimming based on individually measured field maps. In experimental evaluations at 7â€‰T, the proposed approach yielded a residual field standard deviation in the brain of on average 59â€‰Hz, compared with 50â€‰Hz using measured field maps and 176â€‰Hz using no subject-specific shim.


CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that shimming based on predicted field maps is feasible. The field map prediction accuracy could potentially be further improved by generating the template from a subset of subjects, based on parameters such as head rotation and body mass index.

947,"Apoptotic signalling pathway is altered in numerous pathologies such as cancer. In this scenario, caspase-9/PP2AcÎ± interaction constitutes a key target with pharmacological interest to re-establish apoptosis in tumour cells. Very recently a short peptide (C9h) known to disrupt caspase-9/PP2AcÎ± interaction with subsequent apoptosis induction was described. Here we prepared two sets of mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with safranin O (S2) or with C9h peptide (S4) and functionalized with ï¥-polylysine as capping unit. Aqueous suspensions of both nanoparticles showed negligible cargo release whereas in the presence of pronase a marked delivery of safranin O or C9h was observed. Confocal microscopy studies carried out with HeLa cells indicated that both materials were internalized and released their entrapped cargos. Besides, a marked decrease in HeLa cell viability (ca. 50%) was observed when treated with C9h-loaded S4 nanoparticles. Moreover, S4 provides peptide protection from degradation additionally allowing a dose reduction to observe an apoptotic effect when compared with C9h alone or in combination with a cell-penetrating peptide (i.e.Mut3DPT-C9h). Flow cytometry studies, by means of Annexin V-FITC staining, showed the activation of apoptotic pathways in HeLa as a consequence of S4 internalization, release of C9h peptide and disruption of caspase-9/PP2AcÎ± interaction.",Germany,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",29193344,2017,Îµ-polylysine-capped mesoporous silica nanoparticles as carrier of the C9h peptide to induce apoptosis in cancer cells.,n
949,"One emerging and exciting topic in robotics research is the design of micro-/nanoscale robots for biomedical operations. Unlike industrial robots that are developed primarily to automate routine and dangerous tasks, biomedical nanorobots are designed for complex, physiologically relevant environments, and tasks that involve unanticipated biological events. Here, a biologically interfaced nanorobot is reported, made of magnetic helical nanomotors cloaked with the plasma membrane of human platelets. The resulting biomimetic nanorobots possess a biological membrane coating consisting of diverse functional proteins associated with human platelets. Compared to uncoated nanomotors which experience severe biofouling effects and hence hindered propulsion in whole blood, the platelet-membrane-cloaked nanomotors disguise as human platelets and display efficient propulsion in blood over long time periods. The biointerfaced nanorobots display platelet-mimicking properties, including adhesion and binding to toxins and platelet-adhering pathogens, such as Shiga toxin and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The locomotion capacity and platelet-mimicking biological function of the biomimetic nanomotors offer efficient binding and isolation of these biological threats.

By changing the molecular species X and substitution position (i, j) for the linker part, a variety of intermonomer distances R and relative alignments between the phenalenyl dimers can be realized from the geometry optimizations, resulting in a wide range tuning of diradical characters y and charge asymmetricity. It is found that the static second hyperpolarizabilities along the stacking direction, Î³yyyy, are one-order enhanced for phenalenyl dimer systems exhibiting intermediate y, the feature of which is in good agreement with the ""y-Î³ correlation"". By replacing the central carbon atoms of the phenalenyl rings by a boron and a nitrogen, we have also designed covalently-linked heterophenalenyl dimers. The introduction of such a charge asymmetricity to the open-shell systems, which leads to closed-shell ionic ground states, is found to further enhance the Î³yyyy values of the systems having longer intermonomer distance R with intermediate ionic character, i.e., charge asymmetricity.

METHODS
All HCV LT recipients with severe fibrosis in 15 Italian transplant centers were treated with DCV+SOFÂ±RBV for 24 weeks; sustained virological response was assessed at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12).


RESULTS
87 patients were enrolled (75.9% males, mean age 58.4Â±7.2 years, 83.9% genotype 1, 81.6% cirrhosis); 52 (59.8%) received RBV.

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.


OBJECTIVES
Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.


METHODS
Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: ""tremor"", ""tremor disorders"", ""essential tremor"", ""dystonic tremor"", and ""classification"" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.


RESULTS
Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2.

Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes.


METHODS
Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite scores.


RESULTS
Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.03 units/year, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003); this difference was comparable with 8â€‰years of aging. However, being in the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal (pâ€‰=â€‰0.71) or global score (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory decline (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.01 units/year, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.002; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive function-attention decline.


CONCLUSIONS
A variable pattern of depressive symptom severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern related to decline in executive function-attention.

Endophytic fungal association protects this plant from adverse environmental conditions. This plant is used in Bangladeshi folk medicine, but it has not been extensively studied phytochemically, and there is hardly any report on investigation on endophytic fungi growing on this plant. In this study, endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface sterilized cladodes and leaves of H.Â fomes. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria and the fungal strain, Candida albicans. Extracts of Pestalotia sp. showed activities against all test bacterial strains, except that the ethyl acetate extract was inactive against Escherichia coli. The structures of the purified compounds, oxysporone and xylitol, were elucidated by spectroscopic means. The anti-MRSA potential of the isolated compounds were determined against various MRSA strains, that is, ATCC 25923, SA-1199B, RN4220, XU212, EMRSA-15, and EMRSA-16, with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 32 to 128Â Î¼g/ml.

Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. was used as a messenger drug to increase the distribution of drugs in brain tissue in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The present study investigates the transport of echinacoside (ECH) through MDCK-MDR1 cell and the effects of ligustilide (LIG), senkyunolide A (SENA) and senkyunolide I (SENI) in chuanxiong on its transport. The results indicated that the absorption of ECH was relatively poor in MDCK-MDR1cells, and was concentration dependent and not saturable. The P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil could significantly increase the transport of ECH. It indicated that the transport mechanism might be passive diffusion as the dominating process with the active transportation mediated mechanism involved. The increased apparent permeability of ECH in AÂ â†’Â B direction by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-Na2 suggested that ECH was absorbed via the paracellular route. The transport of ECH in AÂ â†’Â B direction significantly increased when co-administrated with increasing concentrations of LIG, SENI and SENA.

968,"CONTEXT
Medical educators often have prior and primary experience in other academic and clinical disciplines. Individuals seeking successful careers in the education of medical students and doctors must, at some point in their development, make a conscious transition into a new identity as a medical educator. This is a necessary move if individuals are to commit to acquiring and maintaining specialist expertise in medical education. Some achieve this transition successfully, whereas others struggle and may even lose interest and abandon the endeavour. We explored senior educators' experiences of achieving the transition into medical education and their views on what helps and what hinders the process.


METHODS
In 2015 we conducted three focus groups with 15 senior medical educators. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied transition theory to guide our deductive analysis, using Schlossberg's Four S (4S) framework to code and report participants' self-reported perceptions of those factors relating to Self, Situation, Support and Strategy that had assisted them to make a successful transition to a fully acknowledged medical educator identity. Through inductive analysis, we then identified 17 explanatory sub-themes common to all three focus groups.


RESULTS
Background and circumstances, individual motivation, a sense of control, organisational support, and effective networking and information-seeking behaviour were factors identified as contributing to successful transition into, and maintenance of, a strong self-identity as a medical educator.


CONCLUSIONS
The experiences of established medical educators and, in particular, an exploration of the factors that have facilitated their transition to an acknowledged self-identity as a medical educator could assist in supporting new educators to cope with the changes involved in developing as a medical educator.",England,Medical education,29193365,2017,Making the leap to medical education: a qualitative study of medical educators' experiences.,y

Mycobacterium abscessus, an environmental, nontuberculous, rapidly growing mycobacterium, is an emerging human pathogen causing serious lung infections and one of the most difficult to treat, due to its multidrug resistance and biofilm-forming ability. We wanted to evaluate the antimicrobial and antivirulence activity of curcumin and its ability to synergize with antibiotics against a clinical M.Â abscessus strain (29904), isolated from the bronchoaspirate of a 66-year-old woman admitted to hospital for suspected tuberculosis. Curcumin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)Â =Â 128Â mg/L] was synergic (fractional inhibitory concentration index â‰¤0.5) with amikacin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid, to which strain 29904 showed resistance/intermediate susceptibility.

974,"The FET sub-family (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) of RNA-binding proteins have remarkably similar overall structure but diverse biological and pathological roles. The molecular basis for FET protein specialisation is largely unknown. Gly-Arg-Rich regions (RGG-boxes) within FET proteins are targets for methylation by Protein-Arginine-Methyl-Transferase-1 (PRMT1) and substrate capture is thought to involve electrostatic attraction between positively charged polyRGG substrates and negatively charged surface channels of PRMT1. Unlike FUS and EWS, a high proportion of TAF15 RGG-boxes are embedded within neutrally charged YGGDR(S/G)G repeats, suggesting that they might not bind well to PRMT1. This notion runs contrary however to a report that YGGDR(S/G)G repeats are methylated by PRMT1. Using peptide-based polyRGG substrates and a novel 2-hybrid binding assay, we find that the Asp residue in YGGDR(S/G)G repeats confers poor binding to PRMT1. Our results therefore indicate that YGGDR(S/G)G repeats may contribute to TAF15 specialisation by enabling differential interactions with PRMT1 and reduced overall levels of TAF15 methylation compared with other FET proteins. By analogy with molecular recognition of other disordered polyvalent ligands by globular protein partners, we also propose a dynamic polyelectrostatic model for substrate capture by PRMT1.

978,"OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to assess current practices around obtaining consent for blood transfusion and provision of patient information in hospitals across the UK and identify areas for improvement.


BACKGROUND
Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) (2011) state that valid consent should be obtained for blood transfusion and documented in clinical records. A standardised source of information should be available to patients. Practices in relation to this have historically been inconsistent.


METHODS
The consent process was studied in hospitals across the UK over a 3-month period in 2014 by means of an audit of case notes and simultaneous surveys of patients and staff.


RESULTS
In total, 2784 transfusion episodes were reviewed across 164 hospital sites. 85% of sites had a policy on consent for transfusion. Consent was documented in 43% of case notes. 68% of patients recalled being given information on benefits of transfusion, 38% on risks and 8% on alternatives and 28% reported receiving an information leaflet. In total, 85% of staff stated they had explained the reason for transfusion, but only 65% had documented this. 41% of staff had received training specifically on transfusion consent in the last 2â€‰years.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a need to improve clinical practice in obtaining valid consent for transfusion in line with existing national guidelines and local Trust policies, with emphasis on documentation within clinical records. Provision of patient information is an area particularly highlighted for action, and transfusion training for clinicians should be strengthened.",England,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",29193375,2017,National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion: report on the 2014 audit of patient information and consent.,n
979,"BACKGROUND
In patients with severe aortic regurgitation (AR), the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricle (LV) size are crucial for determining clinical prognosis and timing of valve intervention. In clinical practice, LV internal diameters obtained at end-diastole are used to assess the degree of LV dilatation. Whether quantification of LV volumes would provide more robust information as compared to LV linear dimensions is unknown.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed preoperative and postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms of patients who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe AR. Indexed linear LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters along with indexed LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were obtained as per current guidelines. Post-AVR LV reverse remodeling, defined as â‰¥10% reduction in measures of LV volumes (Teichholz and Simpson's methods), was determined. Positive and negative agreement was calculated between the volume- and diameter-based LV reverse remodeling.


RESULTS
Sixty-two consecutive patients were included. Nine patients (17%) without LV reverse remodeling based on Teichholz were reclassified as having LV reverse remodeling based on Simpson (positive agreement 0.846 [95% CI 0.772, 0.921], negative agreement 0.200 [95% CI -0.350, 0.435]). Left ventricle (LV) reverse remodeling assessed by the Teichholz method was underestimated by a mean of 31Â mL/m2 (Î²Â =Â -0.65 [95% CI -1.06 to -0.24], PÂ =Â .003) compared to Simpson method.


CONCLUSION
Compared to the volume-based method, diameter-based LV measurement incorrectly identified LV reverse remodeling post-AVR in 17% of patients with severe AR.

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection in dermatology clinics. The commonly used diagnostic method, potassium hydroxide (KOH) direct microscopy, does not have a high positive detection rate. Therefore, a new diagnostic method is needed to confirm onychomycosis.


OBJECTIVES
The objective of this research was to use fluorescent brightener 85 (FB 85), a new fluorescent reagent for fungi detection, and to evaluate this new method based on the diagnostic positive rate, accuracy and efficiency in suspected onychomycosis compared with the KOH method.


METHODS
Subungual debris were collected from clinically suspected onychomycosis cases and divided into two parts. The parts were examined by FB 85 and 10% KOH solution, respectively.


RESULTS
In total, 108 patients with suspected onychomycosis were recruited. The positive rates of FB 85 and KOH were 88.9% and 55.6%, respectively. The patients showed significant statistical differences (P<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Compared with the KOH method, the FB 85 fluorescent method was an accurate and efficient method with a higher positive rate.

This species has been characterized by several spectroscopic techniques and cryospray mass spectrometry. Similar to most of the previously described low-spin hydroperoxoiron(III) compounds, 3 behaves as a sluggish oxidant and it is not kinetically competent for breaking weak C-H bonds. However, triflic acid addition makes 3 much more reactive towards organic substrates and becomes capable of oxidizing unactivated C-H bonds with high stereospecificity. Stopped-flow kinetic analyses and theoretical studies provide a rationale for the observed chemistry, a triflic-acid-assisted heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to form a putative strongly oxidizing oxoiron(V) species.

Pediatricians manage skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (AD) but report that their dermatologic training is inadequate. Online modules may enhance medical education when sufficient didactic or clinical teaching experiences are lacking. We assessed whether an online module about AD improved pediatric residents' knowledge and changed their clinical management of AD.


METHODS
Target and control cohorts of pediatric residents from two institutions were recruited. Target subjects took a 30-question test about AD early in their residency, reviewed the online module, and repeated the test 6 months and 1 year later. The control subjects, who had 1 year of clinical experience but had not reviewed the online module, also took the test. The mean percentage of correct answers was calculated and compared using two-sided, two-sample independent t tests and repeated-measures analysis of variance. For a subset of participants, clinical documentation from AD encounters was reviewed and 13 practice behaviors were compared using the Fisher exact test.


RESULTS
Twenty-five subjects in the target cohort and 29 subjects in the control cohort completed the study. The target cohort improved from 18.0 Â± 3.2 to 23.4 Â± 3.4 correctly answered questions over 1 year (P < .001). This final value was greater than that of the control cohort (20.7 Â± 4.5; P = .01).

983,"PURPOSE
Golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) MRI reconstruction requires gridding and regridding to transform data between radial and Cartesian k-space. These operations are repeatedly performed in each iteration, which makes the reconstruction computationally demanding. This work aimed to accelerate GRASP reconstruction using self-calibrating GRAPPA operator gridding (GROG) and to validate its performance in clinical imaging.


METHODS
GROG is an alternative gridding approach based on parallel imaging, in which k-space data acquired on a non-Cartesian grid are shifted onto a Cartesian k-space grid using information from multicoil arrays. For iterative non-Cartesian image reconstruction, GROG is performed only once as a preprocessing step. Therefore, the subsequent iterative reconstruction can be performed directly in Cartesian space, which significantly reduces computational burden. Here, a framework combining GROG with GRASP (GROG-GRASP) is first optimized and then compared with standard GRASP reconstruction in 22 prostate patients.


RESULTS
GROG-GRASP achieved approximately 4.2-fold reduction in reconstruction time compared with GRASP (âˆ¼333â€‰min versus âˆ¼78â€‰min) while maintaining image quality (structural similarity index â‰ˆ 0.97 and root mean square error â‰ˆ 0.007). Visual image quality assessment by two experienced radiologists did not show significant differences between the two reconstruction schemes. With a graphics processing unit implementation, image reconstruction time can be further reduced to approximately 14â€‰min.


CONCLUSION
The GRASP reconstruction can be substantially accelerated using GROG. This framework is promising toward broader clinical application of GRASP and other iterative non-Cartesian reconstruction methods. Magn Reson Med, 2017.

984,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To explore the experience of patients affected by COPD following hospitalization due to an acute exacerbation event.


BACKGROUND
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressively debilitating disease, often with very burdensome symptoms such as acute and chronic breathlessness and fatigue. Acute exacerbation often creates a life threatening event. Exacerbation can also have substantial psychological effects including anxiety and depression although this aspect is less well researched - especially amongst people with COPD recovering from an acute event and facing a return home.


DESIGN
A descriptive phenomenological study.


METHODS
In depth interviews were conducted with twelve COPD patients recently recovering from an acute exacerbation of their COPD. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological framework.


RESULTS
Four themes were identified from the data: a sense of loss and frustration, hopelessness, uncertainty about the future and fear of becoming a burden. Participants expressed quite negative views including a loss of hope, uncertainty about their future care and the burden they may become on their families. They appeared stressed and anxious as a result of the acute event they had experienced.


CONCLUSIONS
This study shows that an acute episode of illness can generate a sense of hopelessness and uncertainty about their future care in people with COPD. This occurs as they recover physically and think about the future, often in quite negative terms.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
For healthcare professionals it is important to take into account the potential feelings of loss, hopelessness and uncertainty that people can experience following an acute exacerbation of their COPD and ensure that psychological care is available as physical recovery takes place. Such care to include good discharge planning, giving patients time to express concerns and referral to counselling services if appropriate. This article is protected by copyright.

No-reflow is associated with a poor prognosis in STEMI patients. There are many factors and mechanisms that contribute to the development of no-reflow, including age, reperfusion time, a high thrombus burden, Killip class, long stent use, ejection fraction â‰¤40, and a high Syntax score. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the parameters associated with no-reflow prediction by creating a new scoring system.


METHODS
The study included 515 consecutive STEMI patients who underwent PCI; 632 STEMI patients who had undergone PCI in another center were included in the external validation of the scoring system. The correlations between 1-year major adverse cardiac events and low/high risk score were assessed.


RESULTS
In this study, seven independent variables were used to build a risk score for predicting no-reflow. The predictors of no-reflow are age, EF â‰¤40, SS â‰¥22, stent length â‰¥20, thrombus grade â‰¥4, Killip class â‰¥3, and pain-balloon time â‰¥4â€‰h. In the derivation group, the optimal threshold score for predicting no-reflow was >10, with a 75% sensitivity and 77.7% specificity (Area under the curve (AUC)â€‰=â€‰0.809, 95%CI: 0.772-0.842, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).

986,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with increased resource use and total hospital cost after liver transplantation (LT).


METHODS
A study of liver transplantation patients undergoing surgery between January 2008 to December 2013 was performed. Main end points were LOS, ICU LOS, days on the ventilator, total hospital costs (THC), service area costs.


RESULTS
191 patients undergoing LT were included in the analysis. Creatinine and blood transfusion were significantly associated with prolonged LOS, ICU LOS and days on the ventilator. Multivariable analysis of predictors of THC demonstrated creatinine as a strong pre-operative factor. Creatinine was also a significant predictor of OR, ICU, pharmacy, in-patient (floor), diagnostics, and ancillary services cost. After controlling for intraoperative factors such as operative time and blood transfusions we found that transfusions were the strongest independent predictors of total cost. Patients receiving less than 5 units of PRBCs had a median LOS of 7 days. ICU LOS doubled and ICU total cost increased by 50% if patients required more than 5 transfusions of PRBCs.


CONCLUSIONS
Elevated serum creatinine and blood transfusions are the most critical determinants of increased resource utilization and hospital expenditure in liver transplantation.

987,"Reduced nitrogen is indispensable to plants. However, its limited availability in soil combined with the energetic and environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilizers motivates research into molecular mechanisms toward improving plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We performed a systems-level investigation of this problem by employing multiple 'omics methodologies on cell suspensions of hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x Populus alba). Acclimation and growth of the cell suspensions in four nutrient regimes ranging from abundant to deficient supplies of carbon and nitrogen revealed that cell growth under low-nitrogen levels was associated with substantially higher NUE. To investigate the underlying metabolic and molecular mechanisms, we concurrently performed steady-state 13 CÂ metabolic flux analysis with multiple isotope labels and transcriptomic profiling with cDNA microarrays. The 13 C flux analysis revealed that the absolute flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) was substantially lower (~3-fold) under low-nitrogen conditions. Additionally, the flux partitioning ratio between the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and anaplerotic pathways varied from 84%:16% under abundant carbon and nitrogen to 55%:45% under deficient carbon and nitrogen. Gene expression data, together with the flux results, suggested a plastidic localization of the oxPPP as well as transcriptional regulation of certain metabolic branchpoints including those between glycolysis and the oxPPP. The transcriptome data also indicated that NUE-improving mechanisms may involve a redirection of excess carbon to aromatic metabolic pathways and extensive downregulation of potentially redundant genes (in these heterotrophic cells) that encode photosynthetic and light-harvesting proteins, suggesting the recruitment of these proteins as nitrogen sinks in nitrogen-abundant conditions.

989,"Acireductone dioxygenase (ARD) is an intriguing enzyme from the methionine salvage pathway capable of catalyzing two different oxidation reactions with the same substrate, depending on the type of the metal ion in the active site. To date, the structural information regarding ARD-acireductone complex is limited and the reaction mechanisms are still under debate. In this contribution we report results of joint experimental and computational studies undertaken to advance our knowledge about ARD. We have determined a structure of ARD from Homo sapiens with selenomethionine. EPR spectroscopy results suggest that binding of acireductone triggers one protein residue to dissociate from Fe2+, which allows NO (and presumably O2) to bind directly to the metal. MÃ¶ssbauer data, interpreted with the aid of DFT/QM/MM/MD calculations, is consistent with bidentate binding of acireductone to Fe2+ and concomitant dissociation of His88 from the metal. Major features of iron vibrational spectra obtained for native enzyme and upon addition of acireductone are reproduced by QM/MM calculations for the models proposed to explain the MÃ¶ssbauer data. A computational (QM/MM) study on the reaction mechanisms suggests that Fe2+ promotes O-O bond homolysis that elicits cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of the substrate. Higher M3+/M2+ redox potentials of other divalent metals do not support this pathway and instead the reaction proceeds alike to the key reaction step of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase.",Germany,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",29193386,2017,On structure and reaction mechanism of human acireductone dioxygenase.,n
990,"Apolygus lucorum is the predominant pest of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton in China. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) plays a key role in the reproduction of this insect. To better understand the mechanism underlying 20E-regulated reproduction, the nuclear hormone receptor E75 isoform-A of Ap.Â lucorum (Al-E75A) was cloned and its expression analysed. A 2241-bp sequence of Al-E75A cDNA encoded an open reading frame of a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 69.04 kDa. Al-E75A mRNA was detected in female adult stages of Ap.Â lucorum with peak expression in 7-day-old animals. Al-E75A was also expressed in several tissues, particularly in the fat body and ovary. A 3.2 kb Al-E75A mRNA was detected in all tissues by Northern blot. The fecundity and longevity were significantly decreased in female adults treated with Al-E75A small interfering RNA. The rates of egg incubation rates were considerably lower in the RNA interference-treated animals compared to the untreated controls. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effects described above, vitellogenin (Al-Vg) was selected for further investigation. The expression pattern of Al-Vg was similar to that of Al-E75A and was up-regulated by 20E. After knockdown of Al-E75A, the expression profile of Al-Vg and the protein levels were down-regulated. These findings suggest that Al-E75A plays a crucial role in the regulation of Al-Vg expression in Ap.Â lucorum.",England,Insect molecular biology,29193387,2017,The nuclear hormone receptor E75A regulates vitellogenin gene (Al-Vg) expression in the mirid bug Apolygus lucorum.,n
991,"OBJECTIVES
Despite the availability of a wide selection of anti-diabetic treatments, many type 2 DM (T2DM) patients still do not have controlled glucose levels. In addition to pharmacological intervention, patients' own implicit beliefs about their illness should be targeted for health intervention. Thus, we conducted a quantitative study to evaluate the associations between illness perception (IP) domains and metabolic control (HbA1c) of T2DM patients in Selama Hospital and to identify patients' perceptions of the causal T2DM factors.


METHOD
A cross-sectional study was conducted in the outpatient department of Selama Hospital from October to December 2015. A total of 200 T2DM patients were recruited using systematic random sampling. A self-administered validated questionnaire consisting of three sections was used, and the data were analysed using SPSS version 18. The associations between eight IP domains and HbA1c were evaluated via multiple linear regression. P values <0.05 were considered significant.


KEY FINDINGS
The analysis included data from 200 respondents with a mean age of 57.7 years (SE = 9.8). The majority were women (64.5%) and Malays (86%) with a primary school education (43.5%) and a family history of diabetes (53.5%). The median duration of illness was 5 years (IQR = 7), and the median HbA1c level was 8.15% (IQR = 3.1). The mean score for the eight IP domains was 33.7 (SE = 8.43) out of a total score of 80. Using multiple linear regression, HbA1c was found to be significantly associated with IP domains of identity symptoms at 0.221 (95% CI 0.083-0.358). Moreover, 79.4% of patients ranked diet and eating behaviour as the main factor for T2DM.


CONCLUSION
The IP domain of identity symptoms was significantly correlated with T2DM metabolic control. By understanding patients' IP, healthcare providers can focus on behavioural approaches to managing T2DM patients. Steps must be taken to educate patients about the importance of diet control in managing T2DM.",England,The International journal of pharmacy practice,29193388,2017,The associations of illness perception with metabolic control (HbA1c) among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in a district hospital.,n

This systematic review aimed to analyze the antimicrobial action of Copaiba oil against oral pathogens, when compared to that of control substances. A search on Medline/PubMed, LILACS, SciELO, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases were performed up to March 2017. To be included, the studies needed to perform any antimicrobial activity essay, using copaiba oil and a control substance. The antimicrobial effect of each substance, in each study, was extracted. Eleven studies were included, and several copaiba species were used. All studies showed that copaiba oil, regardless of its species, presented a bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic effect in in vitro analyzes. Only one study showed that the antimicrobial effect of the Copaifera officinalis was similar to the one found in chlorhexidine. A higher risk of bias was detected in most of the included studies. The studies demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of copaiba oil, in most cases, is lower than chlorhexidine, which is considered the gold standard. However, there is great potential against oral bacteria.

994,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory programmed cell death, is linked to atherosclerosis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a natural flavonoid, was reported to exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. However, the effect of DHM on atherosclerosis-related pyroptosis has not been studied. In the present study, palmitic acid (PA) treatment led to pyroptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as evidenced by caspase-1 activation, LDH release, and propidium iodide-positive staining; enhanced the maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1Î² and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and markedly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels. Moreover, NLRP3 siRNA transfection or treatment with inhibitors efficiently suppressed PA-induced pyroptosis, and pretreatment with total ROS scavenger or mtROS scavenger attenuated PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis. However, DHM pretreatment inhibited PA-induced pyroptotic cell death by increasing cell viability, decreasing LDH and IL-1Î² release, improving cell membrane integrity, and abolishing caspase-1 cleavage and subsequent IL-1Î² maturation. We also found that DHM pre-treatment remarkably reduced the levels of intracellular ROS and mtROS and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA abrogated the inhibitory effects of DHM on ROS generation and subsequent PA-induced pyroptosis. Together, these results indicate that the Nrf2 signaling pathway plays a role, as least in part, in the DHM-mediated improvement in PA-induced pyroptosis in vascular endothelial cells, which implies the underlying medicinal value of DHM targeting immune/inflammatory-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis.

995,"Intraspecific diversity is central to the management and conservation of exploited species, yet knowledge of how this diversity is distributed and maintained in the genome of many marine species is lacking. Recent advances in genomic analyses allow for genome-wide surveys of intraspecific diversity and offer new opportunities for exploring genomic patterns of divergence. Here, we analyzed genome-wide polymorphisms to measure genetic differentiation between an offshore migratory and a non-migratory population and to define conservation units of Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) in coastal Labrador. A total of 141 individuals, collected from offshore sites and from a coastal site within Gilbert Bay, Labrador, were genotyped using an ~11k single nucleotide polymorphism array. Analyses of population structure revealed strong genetic differentiation between migratory offshore cod and non-migratory Gilbert Bay cod. Genetic differentiation was elevated for loci within a chromosomal rearrangement found on linkage group 1 (LG1) that coincides with a previously found double inversion associated with migratory and non-migratory ecotype divergence of cod in the northeast Atlantic. This inverted region includes several genes potentially associated with adaptation to differences in salinity and temperature, as well as influencing migratory behaviour. Our work provides evidence that a chromosomal rearrangement on LG1 is associated with parallel patterns of divergence between migratory and non-migratory ecotypes on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

996,"BACKGROUND
In horses, the only established method for reinnervation of the larynx is the nerve-muscle pedicle implantation, whereas in human medicine, direct nerve implantation is a standard surgical technique for selective laryngeal reinnervation in patients suffering from bilateral vocal fold paralysis.


OBJECTIVES
(1) To describe a modified first or second cervical nerve transplantation technique for the treatment of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) in horses and (2) evaluate the outcomes of reinnervation using direct nerve needle-stimulation of the first cervical nerve and exercising endoscopy before and after surgery.


STUDY DESIGN
Case series.


METHODS
Nerve transplantation surgery, in which the first or second cervical nerve is tunnelled through the atrophied left cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle, was performed in combination with ipsilateral laser ventriculocordectomy. Ultrasound-guided stimulation of the first cervical nerve at the level of the alar foramen was used to confirm successful reinnervation postoperatively. Exercising endoscopy was performed before and after surgery. The exercising RLN grade of the left arytenoid was blindly determined at the highest stride frequency for each examination.


RESULTS
Surgery was performed in 17 client-owned animals with RLN. Reinnervation was confirmed by nerve stimulation and subsequent arytenoid abduction observed in 11 out of 12 cases between 4 and 12 months post-operatively. Fourteen horses had exercising endoscopy before and after surgery. Nine horses had an improved exercising RLN grade, 4 horses had the same exercising grade and one horse had a worse exercising grade after surgery.


MAIN LIMITATIONS
A sham-operated control group was not included and follow-up beyond 12 months and objective performance data were not obtained.


CONCLUSIONS
The modified first or second cervical nerve transplantation technique, using tunnelling and direct implantation of the donor nerve into the crico-arytenoideus dorsalis muscle, resulted in reinnervation in 11/12 of cases and improved exercising grade in 9/14 horses within 12 months after surgery.

997,"Shell thickness dependent band-gap engineering of quasi type II core-shell material with higher carrier cooling time, lower interfacial defect states and longer charge carrier recombination time can be a promising candidate for both photo-catalysis and solar cell. In the present investigation colloidal CdSe@CdS core-shell with different shell thickness (2, 4 and 6 monolayer CdS) were synthesized through hot injection method and have been characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) followed by steady state absorption and luminescence techniques. Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) studies suggest longer carrier cooling, lower interfacial surface states and slower carrier recombination time in CdSe@CdS core-shell with increasing shell thickness. By TA spectroscopy the role of CdS shell in Power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been explained in details. The measured PCE was found to initially increase and then decrease with increasing the shell thickness. Shell thickness has been optimized to maximize the efficiency after correlating the shell controlled carrier cooling and recombination with PCE values and a maximum PCE of 3.88 % was obtained with 4 monolayer of CdS shell which is found to be 57% higher as compared to bare CdSe QDs.",Germany,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",29193394,2017,Direct Correlation of Excitonics with Efficiency in Core Shell Quantum Dot Solar Cell.,n
998,"Ductal carcinoma inÂ situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous disease that has been investigated less extensively than invasive breast cancer. Women with DCIS are mainly treated with conservative surgery almost exclusively followed by radiotherapy. However, as radiation treatment is not always effective, the search for biomarkers capable of identifying DCIS lesions that could progress to invasive cancer is ongoing. Although conventional biomarkers have been thoroughly studied in invasive tumours, little is known about the role played by androgen receptor (AR), widely expressed in DCIS. A series of 42 DCIS patients treated with quadrantectomy and radiotherapy were followed for a period of up to 95Â months. Of these, 11 had recurrent DCIS or progressed to invasive cancer. All tumours were analysed for clinical pathological features. Conventional biomarkers and androgen receptor expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that AR was higher in tumours of relapsed patients than non-relapsed patients (P value: 0.0005). Conversely, oestrogen receptor (ER) was higher, albeit not significantly, in non-relapsed patients than in relapsed patients. AR/ER ratio was considerably different in the two subgroups (P value: 0.0033). Area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.85 for AR and 0.80 for the AR/ER ratio.

This paper seeks to explore the core components that constitute nurses' preparedness in an epidemic event.


BACKGROUND
Healthcare service providers have worked to augment efforts to protect the public from the impact of epidemic events. While constituting the major healthcare taskforce, nurses are frequently tasked with fronting the response to an infectious disease outbreak. Given the crucial role of nurses in the management of prevailing epidemics, the constituents of their preparedness in epidemic events should be identified.


DESIGN
A systematic search was undertaken to identify eligible studies from the literature. A narrative synthesis approach was employed to extract and synthesize findings of the reviewed qualitative studies.


METHODS
Seven qualitative studies on nurses' experience and perceptions of epidemic events were examined for scientific quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Findings of these studies were synthesized adopting a narrative synthesis approach.


RESULTS
Three interplaying themes were identified: (1) personal resources, (2) workplace resources, and (3) situational influences. The findings suggest that an effective epidemic outbreak response would require further effort to reinforce the interplay between individual nurses, healthcare institutions, and the governments.


CONCLUSIONS
The practical interplay among individual nurses, healthcare institutions, and the governments is crucial in establishing an effective epidemic response.

We hypothesized that tonsillectomy modifies the risk of PD.


OBJECTIVES
To test the hypothesis in a nationwide population-based cohort study.


METHODS
We used Danish medical registries to construct a cohort of all patients in Denmark with an operation code of tonsillectomy 1980-2010 (nâ€‰=â€‰195,169) and a matched age and sex general population comparison cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰975,845).

One hundred three randomized controlled trials were included. TwHF therapy decreased 24-hr proteinuria by 0.59Â g/day (95% confidence interval [CI; -0.68, -0.50]), serum creatinine level by 1.93Â Î¼mol/L (95% CI [-3.69, -0.17]), and blood urea nitrogen level by 0.24Â mmol/L (95% CI [-0.41, -0.07]); increased the total effective rate by 27% (95% CI [1.24, 1.30]); and decreased the incidence of adverse reactions by 19% (95% CI [0.68, 0.96]) overall. Meta regression results showed that the duration of therapy and mean age of participants were the major sources of high heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our statistic results were relatively stable and credible.

MRS acquisitions on the brain microdialysate were performed using a home-built, proton-tuned, microsolenoid with an active volume of 2Â Î¼L. The microcoil was placed at the outlet of the microdialysis probe inside a preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. C6-bearing rats were implanted with microdialysis probes perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor oxamate. Microcoil magnetic resonance spectra were continuously updated using a single-pulse sequence. Localized in vivo spectra and high-resolution spectra on the dialysate were also acquired.

To examine international studies that specifically focus on transition to practice for graduate registered nurses in rural and remote areas.


BACKGROUND
Supportive graduate nursing programs are essential for enabling nursing graduates' transition to practice and reducing attrition rates. Literature examining support measures for nursing graduates within metropolitan areas is abundant. However, there is a paucity of evidence on effective graduate programs for rural and remote based nursing graduates.


DESIGN
A systematic approach was used to identify robust research within appropriate electronic databases.


METHOD
Eligible articles were critically reviewed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool critical appraisal tool. Eligible articles were thematic analysed using the Braun and Clark approach.


RESULTS
Eight articles met the selection criteria for inclusion. Findings revealed that while most graduate nurses survived the transition process, they often felt overwhelmed and abandoned with intense feelings of frustration. Many suffered transition shock and did not feel ready for the role. Socialisation of graduates to the clinical environment was lacking. Support offered in many graduate programs was ad hoc and unstructured. Senior staff were inadequately supported in their roles as preceptors to assist with the transition. Critical support measures recommended included both debrief sessions and regular one on one support.


CONCLUSIONS

Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the effect of Zingiber officinale Roscoe on obesity management. Databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, and Science Direct were searched from 1995 until May 2017 using the definitive keywords. Searching was limited to articles with English language. All of the relevant human and animal studies and also in vitro studies were included. Review articles, abstract in congress, and also other varieties of ginger were excluded. Eligibility of included articles were evaluated by 3 reviewers, which also extracted data. Articles were critically assessed individually for possible risk of bias. Twenty-seven articles (6 in vitro, 17 animal, and 4 human studies) were reviewed. Most of the experimental studies supported the weight lowering effect of ginger extract or powder in obese animal models, whereas the results of the available limited clinical studies showed no changes or slight changes of anthropometric measurements and body composition in subjects with obesity. Ginger could modulate obesity through various potential mechanisms including increasing thermogenesis, increasing lipolysis, suppression of lipogenesis, inhibition of intestinal fat absorption, and controlling appetite. This review article provides some convincing evidence to support the efficacy of ginger in obesity management and demonstrates the importance of future clinical trials.",England,Phytotherapy research : PTR,29193411,2017,A systematic review of the anti-obesity and weight lowering effect of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and its mechanisms of action.,n
1015,"Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, is found in various kinds of fruits, plants, and their commercial products such as red wine. It has been demonstrated to exhibit a variety of health-promoting effects including prevention and/or treatment of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, diabetes, neurodegeneration, aging, and cancer. Cellular defensive properties of resveratrol can be explained through its ability of either directly neutralizing reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) or indirectly upregulating the expression of cellular defensive genes. As a direct antioxidant agent, resveratrol scavenges diverse ROS/RNS as well as secondary organic radicals with mechanisms of hydrogen atom transfer and sequential proton loss electron transfer, thereby protecting cellular biomolecules from oxidative damage. Resveratrol also enhances the expression of various antioxidant defensive enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase as well as the induction of glutathione level responsible for maintaining the cellular redox balance. Such defenses could be achieved by regulating various signaling pathways including sirtuin 1, nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 and nuclear factor ÎºB.

The microstructure-imaging paradigm aims to estimate and map microscopic properties of tissue using a model that links these properties to the voxel scale MR signal. Imaging techniques of this type are just starting to make the transition from the technical research domain to wide application in biomedical studies. We focus here on the practicalities of both implementing such techniques and using them in applications. Specifically, the article summarizes the relevant aspects of brain microanatomy and the range of diffusion-weighted MR measurements that provide sensitivity to them. It then reviews the evolution of mathematical and computational models that relate the diffusion MR signal to brain tissue microstructure, as well as the expanding areas of application. Next we focus on practicalities of designing a working microstructure imaging technique: model selection, experiment design, parameter estimation, validation, and the pipeline of development of this class of technique.

1017,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this analysis was to examine the participant characteristics that served as intervention effect moderators of a cardiovascular health promotion intervention study.


DESIGN AND SAMPLE
This exploratory study was a secondary analysis of data collected during a cluster randomized controlled trial. The participants (nÂ =Â 229) of the study were African-American adults recruited from 12 rural churches that were randomized to intervention (nÂ =Â 6) and control (nÂ =Â 6) groups. There were 115 individual participants in the intervention group, and 114 in the control group.


MEASURES
Cardiovascular health intentions, attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy for produce consumption, dietary fat intake, and exercise were measured to test the effect of the intervention. Linear mixed model was used to detect intervention effect moderators.


RESULTS
Personal heart disease status was a moderator of intervention effects for intentions, norms, and self-efficacy regarding dietary fat intake and attitudes about produce consumption. Lacking a family heart disease history was a moderator for dietary fat intake self-efficacy, and age was a dietary fat norms moderator.

1018,"BACKGROUND
The arterial input function (AIF) represents the time-dependent arterial contrast agent (CA) concentration that is used in pharmacokinetic modeling.


PURPOSE
To develop a novel method for estimating the AIF from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) MRI data, while compensating for flow enhancement.


STUDY TYPE
Signal simulation and phantom measurements.


PHANTOM MODEL
Time-intensity curves (TICs) were simulated for different numbers of excitation pulses modeling flow effects. A phantom experiment was performed in which a solution (without CA) was passed through a straight tube, at constant flow velocity.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Dynamic fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGRs) at 3T MRI, both in the simulations and in the phantom experiment. TICs were generated for a duration of 373 seconds and sampled at intervals of 1.247 seconds (300 timepoints).


ASSESSMENT
The proposed method first estimates the number of pulses that spins have received, and then uses this knowledge to accurately estimate the CA concentration.


STATISTICAL TESTS
The difference between the median of the estimated number of pulses and the true value was determined, as well as the interquartile range (IQR) of the estimations. The estimated CA concentrations were evaluated in the same way. The estimated number of pulses was also used to calculate flow velocity.


RESULTS
The difference between the median estimated and reference number of pulses varied from -0.005 to -1.371 (corresponding IQRs: 0.853 and 48.377) at true values of 10 and 180 pulses, respectively. The difference between the median estimated CA concentration and the reference value varied from -0.00015 to 0.00306 mmol/L (corresponding IQRs: 0.01989 and 1.51013 mmol/L) at true values of 0.5 and 8.0 mmol/l, respectively, at an intermediate value of 100 pulses. The estimated flow velocities in the phantom were within 10% of the reference value.


DATA CONCLUSION
The proposed method accurately corrects the MRI signal affected by the inflow effect.

1020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To describe what and why nurses self-disclose to patients in mental health care.


BACKGROUND
Self-disclosure is common, but controversial and difficult to delineate. Extant research suggests that self-disclosure might have several potentially beneficial effects on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome for patients in mental health care, but results are often mixed and limited by definitional inconsistencies.


METHOD
Qualitative descriptive study including data from 16 nurses taking part in participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews.


RESULTS
Separate analyses resulted in four themes addressing the research question of what nurses self-disclose, and one main theme and four subthemes addressing why nurses self-disclose. The content of self-disclosure was captured in the four themes: Immediate family, Interests and activities, Life experiences, and Identity. In addition, results showed that disclosures were common among the nurses. Self-disclosure's potential to transform the nurse-patient relationship, making it more open, honest, close, reciprocal and equal, was the overarching reason why nurses shared personal information. The nurses also chose to self-disclose to share existential and everyday sentiments, to give real-life advice, because it felt natural and responsive to patients' question to do so.


CONCLUSION
Nurse self-disclosure is common and covers a variety of personal information. Nurses have several reasons for choosing to self-disclose, most of which are connected to improving the nurse-patient relationship.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Self-disclosure controversy can make it difficult for nurses to know if they should share personal information or not.

Readmissions are a burden on health care resources and have negative impact on patients. Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) are frequently used in the management of rhythm disorders and advanced heart failure. We assessed 30-day readmissions in patients admitted for CIED implantation in a sample of United States patients.


METHODS
Data were extracted from Nationwide Readmissions Database for calendar year 2013. Patients admitted for CIED implantation were identified using ICD-9 codes. PatientsÂ <Â 18 years of age, with missing data, who died during hospitalization or discharged in December were excluded. Primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day readmission rate. Factors associated with 30-day readmissions were identified and examined using multivariate logistic regression.


RESULTS
We identified 320,783 admissions for CIED implantations. After applying exclusion criteria, 290,420 patients were included in final analysis, out of whom 45,467 (15.7%) patients were readmitted within 30 days. Readmitted patients were younger and had more co-morbidities. Septicemia (5.1%), pneumonia (3.4%), CHF (2.35%) and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (2.3%) were common primary causes of 30-day readmission. Young age, female gender, key co-morbidities, weekend admissions and admission to medium and large size hospital were independent predictors of 30-day readmissions.


CONCLUSION
In our study, 15.7% patients were readmitted within 30 days of an index admission for CIED implantation. Most readmissions were due to infectious or cardiovascular causes. There is a need to identify patients at risk for readmission to improve outcomes and curb the cost of care. This article is protected by copyright.

1023,"INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory etiologies are becoming increasingly recognized as explanations of some neuropathies, especially those occurring in the perioperative period. Although ""brachial neuritis"" is known to affect extraplexal nerves, accessory nerve palsy following median sternotomy has been attributed to stretch on the nerve. To better elucidate stretch as a potential cause, a cadaveric study was performed.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two patients who developed accessory nerve palsy following median sternotomy are presented to illustrate features consistent with the diagnosis of a perioperative inflammatory neuropathy. Five adult unembalmed cadavers underwent exposure of the bilateral accessory nerves in the posterior cervical triangle. A median sternotomy was performed and self retaining retractors positioned. With the head in neutral, left rotation and right rotation, retractors were opened as during surgery while observing and recording any accessory nerve movements.


RESULTS
The self-retaining sternal retractors were fully opened to a mean inter-blade distance of 13 cm. Regardless of head position, from the initial retractor click to maximal opening there was no gross movement of the accessory nerve on the left or right sides.


CONCLUSIONS
Opening self-retaining sternal retractors does not appear to stretch the accessory nerve in the posterior cervical triangle. Based on our clinical experience and cadaveric results, we believe that inflammatory conditions, (i.e., idiopathic brachial plexitis) can involve the accessory nerve, and might be triggered by surgical procedures.

1028,"Using a combination of population- and individual-based analytical approaches, we provide a comprehensive examination of genetic connectivity of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) along ~1,200 km of the California Current System (CCS). We sampled individuals at 33 sites in 2012 to establish a baseline of genetic diversity and hierarchal population genetic structure, and then assessed inter-annual variability in our estimates by sampling again in 2014. Genetic diversity showed little variation among sites or across years. In 2012, we observed weak genetic differentiation among sites (FST range = -0.005 - 0.014) following a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD), and significantly high relatedness among individuals within nine sampling sites. In 2014, pairwise FST estimates were lower (FST range = -0.014 - 0.007), there was no spatial autocorrelation, and fewer sites had significant evidence of relatedness. Based on these findings, we propose that inter-annual variation in the physical oceanographic conditions of the CCS influence larval recruitment and thus gene flow, contributing to inter-annual variation in population genetic structure. Estimates of effective population size (Ne ) were large in both 2012 and 2014. Together, our results suggest that Dungeness crab in the CCS may constitute a single evolutionary population, though geographically limited dispersal results in an ephemeral signal of isolation by distance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that populations of marine organisms may be susceptible to temporal changes in population genetic structure over short time periods, thus inter-annual variability in population genetic measures should be considered.

1029,"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived osteoblasts possess great potential for utilization in bone disorder elucidation and repair; yet, while the general ability of human pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts and lay down bone-specific matrix has been shown, previous studies lack the complete characterization of the process whereby such osteoblasts are derived as well as a comparison between the osteogenic efficiency of multiple cell lines. Here, we compared the osteogenic potential of two human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (RIV9 and RIV4) to human H9 embryonic stem cells. Generally capable of osteogenic differentiation, the overall osteogenic yield was lower in the RIV9 and RIV4 lines and correlated with differential expression of osteocalcin (OCN) in mature cultures and PAX7 and TWIST1 during early differentiation. In the undifferentiated cells the promoters of the latter two genes were differentially methylated potentially explaining the variation in differentiation efficiency. Furthermore, the expression signatures of selected neural crest and mesodermal genes and proteins suggested that H9 cells preferentially gave rise to neural crest-derived osteoblasts, whereas the osteoblasts in the RIV9 cultures were generated both through a mesodermal and a neural crest route albeit each at a lower rate. These data suggest that epigenetic dissimilarities between multiple PSC lines may lead to differences in lineage derivation and mineralization. Since osteoblast progenitors from one origin inadequately repair a defect in the other, these data underscore the importance of screening human pluripotent stem cells lines for the identity of the osteoprogenitors they lay down.

Information regarding masticatory muscle function in children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) is limited. As a consequence, research on masticatory muscle activity in cleft subjects is needed.


AIM
To assess masticatory muscle activity in children surgically treated for CLP as well as identify the possible factors associated with this activity.


DESIGN
The sample comprised 82 children with mixed dentition and Class I occlusions (25 children with unilateral CLP and 57 subjects with no cleft abnormalities).

To investigate the components of the Amalgamation of Marginal Gains (AMG) performance system to identify a set of principles that can be built into an innovative fundamental nursing care protocol.


BACKGROUND
Nursing is urged to refocus on its fundamental care activities, but little evidence exists to guide practising nurses. Fundamental care is a combination of many small behaviours aimed at meeting a person's care needs. AMG is a successful system of performance management that focusses on small (or marginal) gains, and might provide a new delivery framework for fundamental nursing care.


DESIGN
Qualitative interview study.


METHODS
We undertook in depth interviews with healthcare and sports professionals experienced in AMG. We analysed data using open coding in a Framework Analysis, then interrogating the data using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). We triangulated findings with AMG literature to develop an intervention logic model.


RESULTS
We interviewed 20 AMG practitioners. AMG processes were: focusing on many details to optimise performance, identification of marginal gains using different sources, understanding current versus optimum performance, monitoring at micro and macro level, and strong leadership. Elements of normalisation were; whole team belief in AMG to improve performance, a collective desire for excellence using evidence based actions, whole team engagement to identify choose and implement changes, and individual and group responsibility for monitoring performance.


CONCLUSIONS
We have elicited the processes described by AMG innovators in healthcare and sport and have mapped the normalisation potential and work required to embed such a system into nursing practice.

BACKGROUND
Longitudinal studies are vital to better understand the aetiology and moderators of health conditions. This need is especially salient for congenital conditions, such as cleft lip and/or palate, where establishing large, comprehensive datasets from birth is vital to improve understanding and to inform interventions. Various barriers exist in recruiting patients to large cohort studies.

RESULTS
Out of seven emergent themes, three highlighted challenges to recruiting patients, another three described facilitative factors, and one theme overlapped challenges and facilitators. Challenges included: the life circumstances of potential participants; language barriers; and limited clinical research nurse time for study. Facilitative factors included: integrating research into clinical practice; patient information shared with clinical research nurses; and support from the university-based research study team. The theme 'Method of data collection' related to both challenges and facilitators.

1035,"The division of Escherichia coli is mediated by a collection of some 34 different proteins that are recruited to the division septum and are thought to assemble into a macromolecular complex known as 'the divisome'. Herein we have endeavored to better understand the structure of the divisome by imaging two of its core components; FtsZ and FtsN. Super resolution microscopy (SIM and gSTED) indicated that both proteins are localized in large assemblies, which are distributed around the division septum (i.e. forming a discontinuous ring). Although the rings had similar radii prior to constriction, the individual densities were often spatially separated circumferentially. As the cell envelope constricted, the discontinuous ring formed by FtsZ moved inside the discontinuous ring formed by FtsN. The radial and circumferential separation observed in our images indicates that the majority of FtsZ and FtsN molecules are organized in different macromolecular assemblies, rather than in large super-complex. This conclusion was supported by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) measurements, which indicated that the dynamic behavior of the two macromolecular assemblies was also fundamentally different. Taken together, the data indicates that constriction of the cell envelope is brought about by (at least) two spatially separated complexes. This article is protected by copyright.

To evaluate the effects of the implementation of a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings.


BACKGROUND
Care in long-term residential settings for older people is moving away from the biomedical approach and adopting a more person-centred one. Narrative can help shape the way care is planned and organised. The provision of person-centred care that is holistic and that takes account of resident's beliefs and values can be enhanced by incorporating narrative approaches to care within a practice development framework.


DESIGN
The chosen methodology was participatory action research.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2014, a methodological framework of narrative practice was implemented in two residential care settings, comprising 37 residents and 38 staff, using an action research approach. Three action cycles: (i) narrative practice and culture identification, (ii) developing narrative practice and (iii) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation.


RESULTS
Key outcomes emerged in relation to the findings. These were based on narrative being, knowing and doing and centred around the key outcomes of: (i) how people responded to change (narrative being), (ii) the development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and (iii) intentional action (narrative doing).


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a framework of narrative practice demonstrated that how people respond to change, the development of shared understandings and intentional action were interrelated and interlinked. It illustrated the importance of ensuring that practice context is taken account of in the implementation of action research and the importance of ensuring that narrative being, knowing and doing are clear and understandable for change to occur.

Using the four most recent waves of data from the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children and Youths (z-proso), we identified three classes, or separate groups, of youths with distinct patterns of victimization from age 11 to 17. The largest class represented young people who were least likely to be victimized in any way and at any time. The two smaller groups represented different types of poly-victimization-a non-parental and a long-term parental victimization group.

1040,"Skeletal muscle growth and regeneration relies on the activation of muscle specific stem cells, i.e. satellite cells. The activation and differentiation of satellite cells into myoblasts, as well as their migration, proliferation, and fusion of mononuclear myoblasts into a functional, multi-nucleated muscle fiber, are associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis and degradation. The extracellular environment is dynamically adapting to the changes accompanying skeletal muscle growth or repair. Enzymes involved in many biological processes that involve ECM remodeling are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Among metalloproteinases crucial for skeletal muscles are two gelatinases - MMP-9 and MMP-2. In the current study we test the effect of silencing the MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression on the proliferation and differentiation of in vitro cultured skeletal muscle myoblasts. We show that downregulating gelatinase MMP-9 expression results in a delayed myoblast differentiation.",England,Cell biology international,29193437,2017,Silencing of gelatinase expression delays myoblast differentiation in vitro.,n

In England and Wales, 'approved premises' offer 24-hour staffed accommodation for high-risk offenders, most of whom are returning to the community from prison. With a move towards a standardised operating model, it is essential to be able to measure outcomes.


AIMS
Our aim is to collate and evaluate 'benchmarks' for approved premises.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to establish the impact of existing practice in all four approved premises in Wales. Data on well-being, life satisfaction, attitudes to violence and problem-solving abilities were recorded with 114 male residents (of 486), and attitudes to personality disorder and personal well-being/burnout with 30 staff (of 86), in both narrative style and according to a number of scales used within criminal justice and healthcare systems. Perceptions of environmental climate were assessed with both groups. Scores were compared with those from reference groups, including prisoners and secure hospital patients. Criminological outcomes (e.g. prison recall) were obtained for all 486 men.


RESULTS
Scores on the scales used were broadly comparable with those in relevant reference groups, but some showed floor or ceiling effects. Recall rates, whether directly from the premises or after further onward movement, were about 42% overall, comparable with those reported for similar offenders elsewhere.

1042,"BACKGROUND
We hypothesized that symptoms in Jackhammer esophagus (JH) are associated with an imbalance between the prepeak and postpeak phases of contraction. Thus, we developed a method to distinguish the contractile integral components of prepeak and postpeak phase contractile activity to determine the contribution of each phase and their association with dysphagia.


METHODS
Patients diagnosed with JH were enrolled and compared to controls. The first five intact swallows during manometry were analyzed. A single swallow was divided into a prepeak and postpeak phase. The contractile integral of each phase and its corresponding time-controlled integral were computed. All metrics were compared between controls and JH patients subcategorized by the impaction dysphagia question (IDQ) score with cut-off of 6.


KEY RESULTS
Thirty eight JH patients and 71 controls were included. Twelve JH patients had IDQÂ â‰¤Â 6 and 26 with IDQÂ >Â 6. JH patients had higher contractile integral in both phases, and a higher ratio between postpeak to prepeak contractile integral independent of duration. Similarly, JH patients with an IDQÂ >Â 6 had higher contractile metrics than those with IDQÂ â‰¤Â 6. There was a correlation between the IDQ score and the ratio within the postpeak to prepeak contractile integral (rÂ =Â .375).


CONCLUSIONS
Abnormalities in contractile integral of the postpeak phase are more significant in JH with higher dysphagia scores Although the total postpeak contractile integral was higher in symptomatic patients, this was associated with longer duration of postpeak activity suggesting that dysphagia patients with JH have a defect in the postpeak phase of peristalsis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193439,2017,Jackhammer esophagus: Assessing the balance between prepeak and postpeak contractile integral.,n
1043,"INTRODUCTION
Although total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in haemophilic arthropathy can reduce severe joint pain and improve functional disability, it is technically demanding.


AIM
To evaluate mid-term outcomes and complications of TKA in haemophilic arthropathy.


METHODS
This study retrospectively reviewed 131 consecutive primary TKAs in a single institute. The mean age was 41.0Â years old, and the mean follow-up period was 6.8Â years. Clinical and radiographic results were evaluated. Complications were categorized according to the classification system of the Knee Society for TKA complications.


RESULTS
The average Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score improved from 66.0 to 24.2. The average flexion contracture significantly decreased from 17.3Â° to 4.7Â°, but the average pre- and postoperative maximum flexion did not differ (80.9Â° vs 85.6Â°, respectively). The average mechanical axis was varus 5.2Â° preoperatively and valgus 0.3Â° postoperatively. The coronal positions of the femoral and tibial components and the sagittal positions of these components were within Â±3Â° in 83.2%, 89.3%, 63.4% and 73.3% of cases, respectively. Complications occurred in 17 knees (13.0%): hemarthrosis (nÂ =Â 7), medial collateral ligament injury (nÂ =Â 1), stiffness (nÂ =Â 2), deep periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (nÂ =Â 3) and periprosthetic fracture (nÂ =Â 4).


CONCLUSIONS
The mid-term results of TKA in haemophilic arthropathy were satisfactory in pain relief, improved function and decreased flexion contracture. Bleeding and PJI continue to be major concerns for TKA in haemophilic arthropathy, and risk of periprosthetic fracture must be taken into account for patient education and appropriate prevention.",England,Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,29193440,2017,Mid-term outcomes and complications of total knee arthroplasty in haemophilic arthropathy: A review of consecutive 131 knees between 2006 and 2015 in a single institute.,n
1044,"PROBLEM
The association of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with low-dose aspirin (LDASA) provides the therapeutic cornerstone of obstetric anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). This combo approach is not effective in all patients, and few women still experience recurrences.


METHOD OF STUDY
In an elegant in vitro study, Chiombori Quao and colleagues demonstrated that anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) affect the functionality of endometrial endothelial cells interfering with angiogenesis. LMWH and LDASA, in combination or alone, did not display any protective activity but exacerbated aPL-mediated effects.


RESULTS
The above data were advocated as a demonstration of the inefficacy of LMWH and LDASA in obstetric APS. Given the lack of thrombotic lesions in APS placentae, this treatment is mainly empirical. However, clinical practice clearly shows that LMWH and LDASA are effective in most patients. Non-responsive women represent a peculiar subgroup, with a high-risk aPL profile. All experimental models, including in vitro models of obstetric APS, display limitations that should be considered before translating data to patients. In particular, the use of a monoclonal antibody specific for Domain (D) 5 does not fit with the evidence that anti-D1, but not anti-D4,5, are associated with both vascular and obstetric APS manifestations.


CONCLUSIONS
The association of LMWH and LDASA is the most effective therapeutic option for pregnant aPL-positive women. The lack of a clear demonstration of the pharmacological action of LMWH/LDASA should urge to further invtrestigate the pathophysiology of aPL-associated miscarriages.",Denmark,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",29193441,2017,Therapy for antiphospholipid miscarriages: Throwing the baby out with the bathwater?,n

For that purpose, the commercially available modified nucleoside triphosphate named BODIPYÂ® FL-14-dUTP was enzymatically incorporated in vivo into the genome of E. coli mutant K12 strain, which cannot synthesize thymine. The successful incorporation of this thymidine analogue was confirmed first by fluorescence microscope, where the cells were stained in the typical for bodipy green color. Later the preselected labeled E. coli were observed by Hilbert Differential Transmission Electron Microscope (HDC TEM) and the distribution of elemental boron (contained in bodipy) was visualized at high-resolution by an electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) technique. The practical detection limit of boron was found to be around 5 âˆ¼ 10 mmol/kg in area of 0.1 Î¼m2 , which demonstrated that ESI is a suitable approach to study the cytochemistry and location of labeled nucleic fragments within the cytoplasmic chromosomal area. In addition, the fine cellular fibrous and chromosomal ultrastructures were revealed in situ by combing of phase-plate HDC TEM and ESI.

1046,"The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.",England,Journal of sleep research,29193443,2017,A review of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with anxiety.,y
1047,"Morin, a bioflavonoid with diverse pharmacological effects against various diseases; in most cases morin protective effects were attributed to its detoxifying effect against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a chronic, debilitating neuronal pain associated with intense generation of free radicals and proinflammatory cytokine accumulation in peripheral neurons. We investigated the pharmacological effect of morin against metabolic excess mediated mitochondrial ROS generation and corresponding effect on Nrf2, NF-ÎºB pathways in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and in high glucose insulted Mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro 2A (N2A). Animals were evaluated for nerve function parameters, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (MNCV and SNCV) and nerve blood flow (NBF) followed by TUNEL and immunoblot analysis. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by performing JC-1 and MitoSOX assays in high glucose (30 mM) incubated N2A cells. Diabetic animals showed significant impairment in MNCV, SNCV, and NBF as well as increased pain hypersensitivity. However, oral administration of morin at 50 and 100 mg/kg improved SNCV, MNCV, and NBF and reduced sensorimotor alterations (hyperalgesia and allodynia) in diabetic animals. Studies in N2A cells have revealed that morin ameliorated the high glucose-induced mitochondrial superoxide production, membrane depolarization, and total ROS generation. Morin effectively counteracted NF-ÎºB-mediated neuroinflammation by reducing ROS mediated IKK activation and increased Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses in high glucose-induced N2A cells.

1048,"A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16Â years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents. Key Practitioner Message The adoption status (but not attachment representations) was found to be predictive of externalizing and total behaviour problems, suggesting that attachment itself is not the only variable to take into account in explaining possible maladaptive outcomes in late-adopted adolescents. Nevertheless, disorganized attachment positively predicted internalizing problems, being a risk factor for both adopted and nonadopted adolescents. Only for late-adopted adolescents, higher cognitive reappraisal was negatively related with externalizing problems, suggesting that the functional and positive ability to cognitively restructure negative situations may help them to reduce impulsive negative reactions towards others. Both increasing cognitive reappraisal and decreasing expressive suppression may be considered as valuable goals of therapy with adopted adolescents and their parents. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadopted peers, reported lower somatic complaints, suggesting that they may not allow themselves to show physical vulnerability as consequence of their early affective experiences of severe deprivation. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadoptedÂ ones, reported higher level of expressive suppression strategies, which may be considered as an attempt to beÂ compliant with the environment's requests in order to be loved, accepted, and nurtured.",England,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,29193445,2017,Late-adoptions in adolescence: Can attachment and emotion regulation influence behaviour problems?

We investigated p38MAPK activation-induced fetal membrane cell senescence in response to inflammation (tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-Î±]) and infection (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), factors associated with spontaneous preterm birth.


METHOD OF STUDY
Primary amnion epithelial cells (AECs) were exposed to TNF-Î±, 50Â ng/mL and LPS, 100Â ng/mL. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE), a known OS inducer, was used as positive control. AECs were cotreated with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 to determine the effect of OS and p38MAPK. Western blot analysis was performed for active (Phospho-p38MAPK) and total p38MAPK. Senescence was determined by flow cytometry, and culture supernatants were tested for IL-6 using ELISA.


RESULTS
TNF-Î±, but not LPS, increased p38MAPK activation compared to untreated cells (PÂ =Â .01). The number of senescent cells and senescence-associated IL-6 was higher in both TNF-Î± and LPS-treated cells compared to control (PÂ =Â .001, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Antioxidant NAC inhibited p38MAPK activation by TNF-Î±. p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 reduced the development of senescence and IL-6 by TNF-Î± and LPS. CSE treatment validated our current data.

The sample comprised 3770 consecutive patients with a mean age of 49.1Â years; 69.7% were male. OSA was diagnosed and categorized based on a standard respiratory polygraphic sleep study using a type 3 portable monitor. Patients completed the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) prior to the sleep study. In addition, they answered questions about whether they were currently in treatment for mental disorders and whether they had been diagnosed previously with depression. We adjusted for sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity in the logistic regression analyses. In total, 35.1% had apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) <Â 5 (no OSA), 31.9% had AHI: 5-14.9 (mild OSA), 17.3% had AHI: 15-29.9 (moderate OSA) and 15.7% had AHI â‰¥Â 30 (severe OSA). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were significantly lower with increased OSA severity, and also when adjusting for sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity (AHI â‰¥Â 15 as dependent variable). Similarly, currently being in treatment for mental disorders and being diagnosed previously with depression were both associated negatively with OSA severity, with only the latter remaining significant in the fully adjusted model.

1051,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging of amides at 3.5Â ppm and fast-exchanging amines at 3Â ppm provides a unique means to enhance the sensitivity of detection of, for example, proteins/peptides and neurotransmitters, respectively, and hence can provide important information on molecular composition. However, despite the high sensitivity relative to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in practice, CEST often has relatively poor specificity. For example, CEST signals are typically influenced by several confounding effects, including direct water saturation (DS), semi-solid non-specific magnetization transfer (MT), the influence of water relaxation times (T1w ) and nearby overlapping CEST signals. Although several editing techniques have been developed to increase the specificity by removing DS, semi-solid MT and T1w influences, it is still challenging to remove overlapping CEST signals from different exchanging sites. For instance, the amide proton transfer (APT) signal could be contaminated by CEST effects from fast-exchanging amines at 3Â ppm and intermediate-exchanging amines at 2Â ppm. The current work applies an exchange-dependent relaxation rate (Rex ) to address this problem. Simulations demonstrate that: (1) slowly exchanging amides and fast-exchanging amines have distinct dependences on irradiation powers; and (2) Rex serves as a resonance frequency high-pass filter to selectively reduce CEST signals with resonance frequencies closer to water. These characteristics of Rex provide a means to isolate the APT signal from amines. In addition, previous studies have shown that CEST signals from fast-exchanging amines have no distinct features around their resonance frequencies. However, Rex gives Lorentzian lineshapes centered at their resonance frequencies for fast-exchanging amines and thus can significantly increase the specificity of CEST imaging for amides and fast-exchanging amines.",England,NMR in biomedicine,29193448,2017,Increased CEST specificity for amide and fast-exchanging amine protons using exchange-dependent relaxation rate.,n

Using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), we performed a longitudinal study of the biomechanical properties of intracranially implanted GBM in mice and compared the results to histopathology. The biomechanical parameters of viscoelastic modulus, shear wave speed and phase angle were significantly lower in tumors compared with healthy brain tissue and decreased over time with tumor progression. Moreover, some MRE parameters revealed sub-regions at later tumor stages, which were not easily detectable on anatomical MRI images. Comparison with histopathology showed that softer tumor regions contained necrosis and patches of viable tumor cells. In contrast, areas of densely packed tumor cells and blood vessels identified with histology coincided with higher values of viscoelastic modulus and shear wave speed. Interestingly, the phase angle was independent from these anatomical variations.

1053,"BACKGROUND
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence following gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recently, more and more attentions are being focused on gut microbiota in brain and behavior. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is considered as a mediator that links the gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Clostridium butyricum (Cb) on brain damage in a mouse model of TBI.


METHODS
Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a model of TBI-induced by weight-drop impact head injury and were treated intragastrically with Cb.Â The cognitive deficits, brain water content, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) in the brain were also measured.Â Moreover, the intestinal barrier permeability, the expression of TJ protein and GLP-1, and IL-6 level in the intestine were detected.


RESULTS
Cb treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, brain edema, neurodegeneration, and BBB impairment. Meanwhile, Cb treatment also significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins (occludin and zonula occluden-1), p-Akt and Bcl-2, but decreased expression of Bax. Moreover, Cb treatment exhibited more prominent effects on decreasing the levels of plasma d-lactate and colonic IL-6, upregulating expression of Occludin, and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, Cb-treatedÂ mice showed increased the secretion of intestinal GLP-1 and upregulated expression of cerebral GLP-1R.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Cb in TBI mice and the involved mechanisms were partially attributed to the elevating GLP-1 secretion through the gut-brain axis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193450,2017,Clostridium butyricum exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury via the gut-brain axis.,y

However, the ability of MÃ¼ller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) to proliferate and produce neurons is limited in higher vertebrates. Using the chick model system, we investigate how retinoic acid (RA)-signaling influences the proliferation and the formation of MGPCs. We observed an upregulation of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) in the MÃ¼ller glia of damaged retinas where the formation of MGPCs is known to occur. Activation of RA-signaling was stimulated, whereas inhibition suppressed the proliferation of MGPCs in damaged retinas and in fibroblast growth factor 2-treated undamaged retinas. Furthermore, inhibition of RA-degradation stimulated the proliferation of MGPCs. Levels of Pax6, Klf4, and cFos were upregulated in MGPCs by RA agonists and downregulated in MGPCs by RA antagonists. Activation of RA-signaling following MGPC proliferation increased the percentage of progeny that differentiated as neurons. Similarly, the combination of RA and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) significantly increased neurogenesis from retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ).

This study asked 40 cytotechnologists for their views on the competencies of newly graduated biomedical scientists in clinical cytology during the national conference of the Finnish Association of Cytotechnologists in November 2015.


METHODS
The questionnaire mainly consisted of statements that were scored on a five-point Likert-scale, where 1 was not important and 5 was very important. It covered five sections of clinical cytology: sampling and techniques, gynaecological screening, non-gynaecological screening, safety and quality management, and miscellaneous.


RESULTS
Of the 40 delegates approached to complete the questionnaire, 37 (92.5%) agreed. Respondents felt that important sampling and technique competencies were specimen fixation, with a mean score of 4.9 out of 5.0, types of specimens (4.7), Papanicolaou smear collection (4.7), Papanicolaou smear request information (4.7) and evaluation of specimen sufficiency (4.6). Less important competencies were examining FNAs (2.0) and nasopharyngeal specimens (2.2). The respondents had many expectations about how education in cytology could be developed, for example more theoretical lessons, more practice in microscope use, and consistent criteria for training and cooperation between cytology laboratories and universities of applied sciences.

This study investigated the construct validity and reliability of the Chinese Comfort, Afford, Respect, and Expect (CARE) scale, which can be used to determine clinical nurses' competence. The results can also serve to promote nursing competence and improve patient satisfaction.


BACKGROUND
Nurse-patient interaction is critical for improving nursing care quality. However, to date, no relevant validated instrument has been proposed for assessing CNPI (Caring Nurse-Patient Interaction, CNPI) competence in clinical practice. The present study adapted and validated the Chinese version of the CNPI scale.


DESIGN
Cross-cultural adaptation and validation study.


METHODS
A psychometric analysis of the four major constructs of the Chinese CARE scale was conducted on a sample of 356 nurses from a medical center in China. Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis were adopted to extract the main components, both the internal consistency and correlation coefficients were used to examine reliability, and a confirmatory factor analysis was adopted to verify the construct validity.


RESULTS
The goodness-of-fit results of the model were strong. The standardized factor loadings of the CARE scale ranged from 0.73 to 0.95, indicating that the validity and reliability of this instrument were favorable. Moreover, the extracted 12 items explained 95.9% of the measured content of the Chinese CARE scale.


CONCLUSIONS
The results serve as empirical evidence regarding the validity and reliability of the Chinese CARE scale.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Hospital nurses increasingly demand help from patients and their family members in identifying health problems and assisting with medical decision-making. Therefore, enhancing nurses' competence in nurse-patient interactions is crucial for nursing and hospital managers to improve nursing care quality.

PDCS mean and median values were close. Skewness values were into the criterion limits (-1 to +1). The complete range of scores was covered for 14 of the 17 items (83.4%). Floor effect of 25.26% and 28.25% were observed in the Complication and Disability level dimensions due to the proportion of patients free of these difficulties. No relevant floor or ceiling effect was observed for the PDCS Total Score (1.03% and 0.52%, respectively). The stability of the scale appeared excellent with most items meeting weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.80. The convergent validity of the PDCS with corresponding scores of the MDS-UPDRS showed high correlation values (rS â‰¥0.60). The internal validity was into acceptable limits, with the majority of values higher than the minimal 0.30 threshold. The standard error of measurement suggested a satisfactory precision (SEM=3.81, <30% of the PDCS total score standard deviation).


CONCLUSION
The PDCS appears to be a feasible, acceptable, reproducible and valid scale. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",England,European journal of neurology,29193455,2017,The Parkinson's Disease Composite Scale: Results of the first validation study.,y
1060,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The study aimed to examine the coping strategies in patients with heart failure (HF) in the ethnic minority regions of China and to explore the factors affecting the adoption of coping strategies.


BACKGROUND
Effective coping with illness is an important element that influences the adaptation and increases the patient quality of life. Although different factors have been proposed to be determinants of coping strategy, findings are inconclusive, especially when it comes to the cultural background.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional study was performed.


METHODS
A total of 360 HF patients in four districts of Xinjiang were enrolled. All participants completed the medical coping mode questionnaire, the Minnesota living with HF questionnaire, and self-management questionnaire.


RESULTS
HF patients had lower scores in confrontation and higher scores in avoidance and acceptance-resignation than the Chinese norm. The multiple regression analysis revealed several factors that indicate confrontation coping including symptom management, employment status, and psychological and social management, whereas religion (R2), disease duration, employment status and payment system (P2) were identified as indicators of avoidance coping. In addition, ethnicity (E1), disease duration, and employment status were indicators of acceptance-resignation coping.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings from this study suggest that HF patients in the ethnic minority regions may use less confrontation coping and more avoidance and acceptance-resignation coping than patients in the Chinese norm. Moreover, the cultural background, duration of disease, quality of life and self-management play important roles in the selection of HF coping strategy.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The disparities of racial/ethnic exist in coping strategy. Healthcare providers are required to better understand the role of religion in the coping process and how it contributes to the selection of coping strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

The incidence of community-associated Clostridium difficile infection (CA-CDI) in Australia has increased since mid-2011. With reports of clinically important C.Â difficile strains being isolated from retail foods in Europe and North America, a foodborne source of C. difficile in cases of CA-CDI is a possibility. This study represents the first to investigate the prevalence and genotypes of C.Â difficile in Australian retail vegetables.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A total of 300 root vegetables grown in Western Australia (WA) were collected from retail stores and farmers' markets. Three vegetables of the same kind bought from the same store/market were treated as one sample. Selective enrichment culture, toxin profiling and PCR ribotyping were performed. C. difficile was isolated from 30% (30/100) of pooled vegetable samples, 55.6% of organic potatoes, 50% of non-organic potatoes, 22.2% of organic beetroots, 5.6% of organic onions and 5.3% of organic carrots. Over half (51.2%, 22/43) the isolates were toxigenic. Many of the ribotypes of C. difficile isolated were common among human and Australian animals.


CONCLUSIONS
C. difficile could be found commonly on retail root vegetables of WA. This may be potential sources for CA-CDI.

1062,"Although chronic nicotine administration does not affect memory, its withdrawal causes massive cognitive deficits. The underlying mechanisms, however, have not been understood. We test the role of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART), a neuropeptide known for its procognitive properties, in this process. The mice on chronic nicotine treatment/withdrawal were subjected to novel object recognition task. The capability of the animal to discriminate between the novel and familiar objects was tested and represented as discrimination index (DI); reduction in the index suggested amnesia. Nicotine for 49Â days had no effect on DI, but 8-hour withdrawal caused a significant reduction, followed by full recovery at 24-hour withdrawal timepoint. Bilateral CART infusion in dorsal hippocampus rescued deficits in DI at 8-hours, whereas CART-antibody infusion into the dorsal hippocampus attenuated the recovery at 24-hours. Commensurate changes were observed in the CART as well as CART mRNA profiles in the hippocampus. CART mRNA expression and the peptide immunoreactivity did not change significantly following chronic nicotine treatment. However, there was a significant reduction at 8-hour withdrawal, followed by a drastic increase in CART immunoreactivity as well as CART mRNA at 24-hour withdrawal, compared with 8-hour withdrawal. Distinct Î±7-nicotinic receptor immunoreactivity was detected on the hippocampal CART neurons, suggesting cholinergic inputs. An increase in the synaptophysin immunoreactive elements around CART cells in the dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 3 and subiculum at 24-hour post-withdrawal timepoint suggested neuronal plasticity.

1063,"Perinatal stroke is the leading cause of hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP), resulting in life-long disability. In this study, we examined the relationship between robotic upper extremity motor impairment and corticospinal tract (CST) diffusion properties. Thirty-three children with unilateral perinatal ischemic stroke (17 arterial, 16 venous) and hemiparesis were recruited from a population-based research cohort. Bilateral CSTs were defined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and four diffusion metrics were quantified: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivities. Participants completed a visually guided reaching task using the KINARM robot to define 10 movement parameters including movement time and maximum speed. Twenty-six typically developing children underwent the same evaluations. Partial correlations assessed the relationship between robotic reaching and CST diffusion parameters. All diffusion properties of the lesioned CST differed from controls in the arterial group, whereas only FA was reduced in the venous group. Non-lesioned CST diffusion measures were similar between stroke groups and controls. Both stroke groups demonstrated impaired reaching performance. Multiple reaching parameters of the affected limb correlated with lesioned CST diffusion properties. Lower FA and higher MD were associated with greater movement time. Few correlations were observed between non-lesioned CST diffusion and unaffected limb function though FA was associated with reaction time (Râ€‰=â€‰-0.39, pâ€‰<â€‰.01). Diffusion properties of the lesioned CST are altered after perinatal stroke, the degree of which correlates with specific elements of visually guided reaching performance, suggesting specific relevance of CST structural connectivity to clinical motor function in hemiparetic children.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193460,2017,Corticospinal tract diffusion properties and robotic visually guided reaching in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy.,n
1064,"BACKGROUND
Alterations of site-specific gene expression profiles in disease-relevant networks within the different layers of the intestinal wall may contribute to the onset and clinical course of gastrointestinal disorders. To date, no systematic analysis has assessed and compared sub-regional gene expression patterns in all distinct layers of the gut using fresh frozen human samples. Our aim was to establish an optimized protocol for site-specific RNA isolation in order to achieve maximum RNA quality and amount for subsequent gene expression analysis combining laser-capture microdissection (LCM) with a probe-based technology, the NanoString nCounter Analysis system.


METHODS
Four full-thickness colon samples from patients who underwent surgery due to pathological conditions were processed and separated into epithelium, lamina propria, myenteric plexus, submucosa, and tunica muscularis by LCM. Site-specific marker expression by nCounter technology was performed on total RNA from each sub-region, respectively.


KEY RESULTS
Collecting ~10Â mmÂ² (~100Â 000-250Â 000 cells) of tissue from the epithelial layer, lamina propria, and myenteric plexus provided sufficient amounts of RNA of appropriate quality for subsequent analyses. In contrast, ~40Â mmÂ² (~250Â 000-650Â 000 cells) of tissue were dissected from the less cell-rich submucosal and tunica muscularis layer. nCounter analysis revealed a site-specific expression pattern of marker genes in the different layers of the colonic wall which were highly correlating (rÂ >Â .9).

Patients with heart failure (HF) often have multiple co-morbidities that contribute to the risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV outcomes. We assessed the relative contribution of cardiac and extra-cardiac disease burden and demographic factors to CV outcomes in HF patients with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
We utilized data from the CHARM trial, which enrolled HF patients across the ejection fraction spectrum. We decomposed the previously validated MAGGIC risk score into cardiac (LVEF, New York Heart Association class, systolic blood pressure, time since HF diagnosis, HF medication use), extra-cardiac (body mass index, creatinine, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoker), and demographic (age, gender) categories, and calculated subscores for each patient representing the burden of each component. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the population attributable risk (PAR) associated with each component to the outcomes of death, CV death, HF, myocardial infarction, and stroke relative to patients with the lowest risk score. PARs for each component were depicted across the spectrum of LVEF. In 2675 chronic HF patients from North America [HFrEF (LVEF â‰¤40%): n = 1589, HFpEF (LVEF >40%): n = 1086] with data available for calculation of the MAGGIC score, the highest risk of death and CV death was attributed to cardiac burden. This was especially evident in HFrEF patients (PAR: 76% cardiac disease vs. 58% extra-cardiac disease, P < 0.05). Conversely, in HFpEF patients, extra-cardiac burden accounted for a greater proportion of risk for death than cardiac burden (PAR: 15% cardiac disease vs. 49% extra-cardiac disease, P < 0.05). For HF hospitalization, the contribution of both cardiac and extra-cardiac burden was comparable in HFpEF patients (PAR: 42% cardiac disease vs. 53% extra-cardiac disease, P = NS). In addition, demographic burden was especially high in HFpEF patients, with 62% of deaths attributable to demographic characteristics.


CONCLUSION
In North American HF patients enrolled in the CHARM trials, the relative contribution of cardiac and extra-cardiac disease burden to CV outcomes and death differed depending on LVEF. The high risk of events attributable to non-cardiac disease burden may help explain why cardiac disease-modifying medication proven to be efficacious in HFrEF patients has not proven beneficial in HFpEF.",England,European journal of heart failure,29193462,2017,Contribution of cardiac and extra-cardiac disease burden to risk of cardiovascular outcomes varies by ejection fraction in heart failure.,n
1066,"Exosomes (30- to 150-nm particles), originating from multivesicular bodies by the invagination of the endosomal membrane, are communication channels between cells. Exosomes are released by various cell types and cargo proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids reflecting the physiologic status of their cells of origin and cause functional changes in recipient cells, which are likely dependent on their quantity and/or cargo contents. Recently, placental exosomes, produced by various placental cell types, have been isolated from maternal blood using the placental protein-specific marker, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). PLAP-positive exosomes are seen in maternal blood as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increase as gestation progresses, with maximum numbers seen at term. Although the functional relevance of placental exosomes is still under investigation, several studies have linked placental exosomes changes (quantity and cargo) reflecting placental dysfunctions associated with adverse pregnancy events. As placental exosomes can be isolated from maternal blood, they are liquid biopsies reflecting placental functions. Hence, they are useful as biomarkers of placental functions and dysfunctions obtainable through non-invasive approaches.

1067,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. The phenotypic expression of the disease may, in part, relate to alterations in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. This resting-state study sought to clarify this in DLB, how networks differed from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether they were related to clinical symptoms in DLB. Resting-state networks were estimated using independent component analysis. We investigated functional connectivity changes in 31 DLB patients compared to 31 healthy controls and a disease comparator group of 29 AD patients using dual regression and FSLNets. Within-network connectivity was generally decreased in DLB compared to controls, mainly in motor, temporal, and frontal networks. Between-network connectivity was mainly intact; only the connection between a frontal and a temporal network showed increased connectivity in DLB. Differences between AD and DLB were subtle and we did not find any significant correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms in DLB. This study emphasizes the importance of reduced connectivity within motor, frontal, and temporal networks in DLB with relative sparing of the default mode network. The lack of significant correlations between connectivity measures and clinical scores indicates that the observed reduced connectivity within these networks might be related to the presence, but not to the severity of motor and cognitive impairment in DLB patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that AD and DLB may show more similarities than differences in patients with mild disease.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193464,2017,Functional connectivity in dementia with Lewy bodies: A within- and between-network analysis.,y

1071,"INTRODUCTION
Good nutritional care of people following major lower extremity amputation is essential as poor nutritional status can lead to delayed wound healing. Working with patients to identify their perspectives on food, views on nutritional care and the need for dietary counselling enables the development of optimised nutritional care.


AIM
To explore hospital patients' perspectives on food, dietary counselling, and their experiences of nutritional care following lower extremity amputation.


DESIGN
A qualitative, explorative study design was employed.


METHOD
An inductive content analysis of semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 17 people over 50 years of age, who had recently undergone major lower extremity amputation, was undertaken. The study was reported according to the COREQ guideline.


FINDINGS
Three themes emerged; Responsible for own dietary intake, Diet based on preferences and experiences with dietary counselling and Feeling overwhelmed. The participants expressed motivation to ensure their nutritional needs were met but described feeling emotionally overwhelmed by the experience of amputation. They appeared not to expect nursing staff to focus on nutritional issues as they expressed belief that they themselves were solely responsible for their dietary intake. They described being motivated to receive nutritional counselling but indicated advice should be compatible with their lifestyle and eating habits.


CONCLUSION
Lower extremity amputation can be an overwhelming experience which affects nutritional intake. People appear to consider themselves responsible for their nutritional care and describe not experiencing or expecting nursing staff to engage in this aspect of care. Dietary counselling by nurses who respects and incorporates patient preferences and experiences following amputation has the potential to enhance nutritional care.


CLINICAL IMPLICATION
This study illustrates that nurses caring for people who undergo lower extremity amputation need to recognise that nutritional care is an essential component of nursing and should focus on working in partnership with the patient.

1072,"BACKGROUND
Pharmacokinetic (PK) models can describe microvascular density and integrity. An essential component of PK models is the arterial input function (AIF) representing the time-dependent concentration of contrast agent (CA) in the blood plasma supplied to a tissue.


PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS
To evaluate a novel method for subject-specific AIF estimation that takes inflow effects into account.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective study.


SUBJECTS
Thirteen clinical patients referred for spine-related complaints; 21 patients from a study into luminal Crohn's disease with known Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Dynamic fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) at 3T.


ASSESSMENT
A population-averaged AIF, AIFs derived from distally placed regions of interest (ROIs), and the new AIF method were applied. Tofts' PK model parameters (including vp and Ktrans ) obtained with the three AIFs were compared. In the Crohn's patients Ktrans was correlated to CDEIS.


STATISTICAL TESTS
The median values of the PK model parameters from the three methods were compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test. The associated variances were statistically assessed by the Brown-Forsythe test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was computed to test the correlation of Ktrans to CDEIS.


RESULTS
The median vp was significantly larger when using the distal ROI approach, compared to the two other methods (P < 0.05 for both comparisons, in both applications). Also, the variances in vp were significantly larger with the ROI approach (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). In the Crohn's disease study, the estimated Ktrans parameter correlated better with the CDEIS (râ€‰=â€‰0.733, P < 0.001) when the proposed AIF was used, compared to AIFs from the distal ROI method (râ€‰=â€‰0.429, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.067) or the population-averaged AIF (râ€‰=â€‰0.567, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.011).


DATA CONCLUSION
The proposed method yielded realistic PK model parameters and improved the correlation of the Ktrans parameter with CDEIS, compared to existing approaches.

To study the effect of quantitative assessment-based nursing intervention on the bowel function and life quality in patients with neurogenic bowel dysfunction after spinal cord injury.


BACKGROUND
Neurogenic bowel dysfunction after spinal cord injury was clinically manifested by abdominal distension, intractable constipation, prolonged defecation and fecal incontinence, which seriously affected the normal life of patients. Traditional ways of nursing for these patients focused on basic care, but lacked sufficient recognition of disease severity and individual needs.


DESIGN
184 patients with neurogenic bowel dysfunction after spinal cord injury were randomly allocated into observation group (n=92) and control group (n=92).


METHODS
The patients in the control group were given regular nursing and the patients in the observation group were given quantitative assessment-based nursing intervention. Recovery of bowel function, quality of life and satisfaction were compared between the two groups.


RESULTS
Scores for bowel function including bloating, constipation, prolonged defecation, defecation drug dependence and fecal incontinence in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.05). The scores for the quality of life including physical function (PF), general health (GH), social functioning (SF), role-motional (RM), mental health (MH) in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.001). Finally, the satisfaction rate in the observation group was 95.56%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (83.7%) (p<0.01).


CONCLUSION
We concluded that quantitative assessment-based nursing intervention contributed to recovery of bowel function and improvement of life quality and satisfaction.

Previous studies have suggested that ID influences the depth of general anaesthesia (GA) and delays emergence from GA. In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated whether ID affects the time taken to emerge from GA.


METHODS
We selected dental patients who underwent GA at the Department of Dental Anaesthesiology, Okayama University Hospital, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, before dividing the selected participants into ID and non-ID (control) groups. Relevant data were collected from electronic anaesthesia records. Emergence time, the time from the discontinuation of propofol and remifentanil to tracheal extubation, was recorded for each patient. We compared the data of the ID group and control group. The association between ID and the emergence time was tested for statistical significance. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to control for confounders.


RESULTS
A total of 97 cases (controlÂ =Â 50, IDÂ =Â 47) were included in the study. The emergence time was significantly longer in the ID group (ID group: 15.8Â Â±Â 6.6Â min, control group: 10.8Â Â±Â 3.6Â min). The ID group included more men and lower propofol and remifentanil infusion rates. The treatment time was longer, and the mean bispectral index was lower in the ID group. Sevoflurane inhalation was used only for anaesthesia induction in the ID group. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, ID was found to be significantly associated with a longer emergence time.

Data from 19 patients with positive GFAP-IgG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were retrospectively analyzed.


RESULTS
The main disease manifestations included myelitis (68.4%), headache (63.2%), abnormal vision (63.2%), fever (52.6%), ataxia (36.8%), psychosis (31.6%), dyskinesia (15.8%), dementia (15.8%), and seizure (10.5%). Seventeen patients had brain abnormalities (89.5%), of which eight (42.1%) revealed the characteristic radial enhancing and laminar patterns. Cortical abnormalities were found in four patients (21.1%). Other abnormalities were found in the hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla cerebellum, meninges, and skull. Eleven patients had longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions. CSF abnormalities were detected in all patients. Pathological examinations of four patients revealed extensive inflammation, with prominent perivascular B cells and T cells. Abundant antibody-secreting cells were noted in the interstitial and perivascular spaces. Immunohistochemical analysis showed loss of astrocytes and neurons.

In Experiment 1, 5- and 6-year-old children consumed more of a food described as popular with other children than a food that was described as unpopular with other children, even though the two foods were identical. In Experiment 2, children ate more of a food described as popular with children than a food described as popular with adults. Experiment 3 tested whether different perceptual experiences of otherwise identical foods contributed to the mechanisms underlying children's consumption.

To compare endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-FNAC diagnosis of pancreatic lesions with patient outcome based upon the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology pancreaticobiliary terminology classification scheme diagnostic categories: Panc 1 (non-diagnostic); Panc 2 (negative for malignancy/neoplasia); Panc 3 (atypical); Panc 4B (neoplastic, benign); Panc 4O (neoplastic, other); Panc 5 (suspicious of malignancy); and Panc 6 (positive/malignant).


METHODS
All EUS-FNA pancreas specimens taken at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 2015 were prospectively classified according to the above scheme at the time of cytology reporting and data recorded prospectively. Subsequently, outcomes based on clinical follow-up or histopathology diagnosis were compared with the cytology diagnosis.


RESULTS
120 EUS-FNA pancreas specimens from 111 patients were received, of which 112 (93.3%) specimens had follow-up data. There were 79 and 41 EUS-FNA pancreas specimens from solid and cystic lesions, respectively.

1082,"RASSF6, a member of the tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family proteins, induces apoptosis in the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manners. RASSF6 interacts with MDM2 and stabilizes p53. BCL-XL is a prosurvival member of BCL-2 family proteins. BCL-XL directly inhibits proapoptotic BAX and BAK. BCL-XL also traps tBID, a proapoptotic activator BH3-only protein, and sequesters p53. In addition, BCL-XL regulates the mitochondrial membrane permeability via voltage-dependent anion channel. In these manners, BCL-XL plays an antiapoptotic role. We report the interaction of BCL-XL with RASSF6. BCL-XL inhibits the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2 and suppresses p53 expression. Consequently, BCL-XL antagonizes RASSF6-mediated apoptosis.

1083,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
CACNA1S encodes Cav 1.1, a voltage sensor for muscle excitation-contraction coupling, which activates the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) leading to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. CACNA1S mutations cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis, malignant hyperthermia and congenital myopathy. RYR1 mutations result in congenital myopathy, malignant hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis.


METHODS
To describe a novel phenotype associated with a CACNA1S variant at a site previously linked to hypokalemic periodic paralysis.


RESULTS
The patient presented with fluctuating asymptomatic CK elevation after an episode of rhabdomyolysis but has no history of periodic paralysis. His muscle biopsy showed core-like structures occurring mainly in type 2 fibers. He carries a novel Cav 1.1 variant (p.Arg528Leu) affecting a highly conserved amino acid. Different mutations at the same location cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis.


CONCLUSION
This case underscores the similarity between the phenotypes caused by mutations in two functionally linked proteins, RYR1 and Cav 1.1. This article is protected by copyright.

1084,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To investigate the feasibility of a 13-week mentoring program in providing social support to promote hope for recovery in anorexia nervosa.


BACKGROUND
With no clear first line psychological treatment for people with anorexia nervosa, mentoring support programs, as an adjunct to treatment, may provide the social support necessary to promote hope for recovery.


DESIGN
A mixed method study; Participatory action research.


METHODS
Women (n=11), recovering and who had recovered from anorexia nervosa, participated in the program and completed self-report questionnaires related to quality of life, distress and the mentoring relationship at different time points. Qualitative feedback from logbooks, workshop evaluation questionnaires, interviews and focus groups was also collected to assess the program's acceptability.


RESULTS
General compliance for completing most study outcome questionnaires was 90% however the mentoring relationship questionnaires were not completed to the same degree. Five key themes emerged from the focus group/interview data: 1) She understands me and could relate to me; 2) Re-connecting with the world - Asking questions and being challenged; 3) Mentors' altruistic motivations and the transformation and discovery of self; 4) Instilling hope - Recovery is possible; and 5) Effective communication - The key to successful mentoring.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is needed however the results provide preliminary support for the mentoring program's feasibility as an adjunct to treatment. We found that having someone who understands, to talk and share with, met a clear need for people with anorexia nervosa.

1087,"Stroke patients with motor deficits typically feature enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, also healthy subjects may show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with higher motor demands. Therefore, the question arises to what extent stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural reorganization. We here investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1) but unlike in healthy controls also in contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of right SPL onto affected/left M1 in patients but not in controls when moving the affected/right hand independent of the movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of right SPL was positively coupled with the ""active"" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency. In summary, these findings are compatible with a supportive role of right SPL with respect to motor function of the paretic hand in the reorganized brain.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193484,2017,Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients.,y
1089,"BACKGROUND
Fish is a well-recognised cause of food allergy and anaphylaxis. The evolutionary and taxonomic diversity of the various consumed fish species poses a challenge in the identification and characterisation of the major fish allergens critical for reliable diagnostics. Globally, fish is a rising cause of food allergy complicated by a large under-investigated variety of species as well as increasing global tourism and trade. This is the first comprehensive study on allergen profiles of heat-processed fish from Vietnam.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to identify the major heat-stable allergens from frequently exported Asia-Pacific freshwater and marine fish, and characterise the major allergen parvalbumin (PV) from one of the most consumed and exported fish species from Asia, the Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta).


METHODS
Heated protein extracts from 33 fish species were separated by gel-electrophoresis. PV isoforms were identified by immunoblotting utilising three different PV-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and further characterised by mass spectrometry. IgE reactivity was investigated using sera from 21 patients with confirmed fish allergy.


RESULTS
Heat stable IgE-reactive PVs, with up to five isoforms per species, were identified in all 33Â analysed fish species. In the Indian mackerel, seven PV isoforms were identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometric analyses. The amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA of the most expressed isoform showed a high identity (>90%) to PVs from two other mackerel species.


CONCLUSIONS & CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Different PVs were identified as the major heat-stable allergens in all 33 analysed freshwater and marine fish species from Vietnam, many of which are exported worldwide and 21 species that have never been investigated before. The Indian mackerel PV represents a novel fish allergen, now officially registered as Ras k 1. Improved diagnostics for fish allergy against Asia-Pacific species should be developed with focus on PV.

1090,"OBJECTIVE
Whether the definitions of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) differentially impact estimates of the metabolic profile and IFG-related comorbidities in Danish children and adolescents is unknown.


METHODS
Two thousand one hundred and fifty four (979 boys) children and adolescents with overweight or obesity (median age 12 years) and 1824 (728 boys) children with normal weight (median age 12 years) from The Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank were studied. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, puberty, and fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipids were measured.


RESULTS
About 14.1% of participants with overweight or obesity exhibited IFG according to the ADA and 3.5% according to the WHO definition. Among individuals with normal weight, the corresponding prevalences were 4.3% and 0.3%. IFG was associated with a higher systolic blood pressure, higher concentrations of HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide (Pâ€‰<â€‰.0001) and triglycerides (Pâ€‰=â€‰.03), and lower HOMA2-IS and HOMA2-B (Pâ€‰<â€‰.0001) independent of sex, age, puberty, waist-to-height ratio, and degree of obesity. Furthermore, IFG was associated with a higher risk for hypertension (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.66 [95%CI: 1.21; 2.28], Pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and dyslipidemia (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.90 [95%CI: 1.38; 2.56], Pâ€‰<â€‰.0001) compared with the group without IFG independent of age, sex, and puberty.


CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of IFG, when applying the ADA criterion compared with the WHO criterion, was 4 times higher in individuals with overweight and obesity and 14 times higher in individuals with normal weight in this study sample of children and adolescents.

We examined internal lineages and haplotype diversity in Portuguese samples belonging to J-M304 to improve the spatial and temporal understanding of the introduction of this haplogroup in Iberia, using the available knowledge about the phylogeography of its main branches, J1-M267 and J2-M172.


METHODS
A total of 110 males of Portuguese descent were analyzed for 17 Y-chromosome bi-allelic markers and seven Y-chromosome short tandem repeats (Y-STR) loci.


RESULTS
Among J1-M267 individuals (nâ€‰=â€‰36), five different sub-haplogroups were identified, with the most common being J1a2b2-L147.1 (âˆ¼72%), which encompassed the majority of representatives of the J1a2b-P58 subclade. One sample belonged to the rare J1a1-M365.1 lineage and presented a core Y-STR haplotype consistent with the Iberian settlement during the fifth century by the Alans, a people of Iranian heritage. The analysis of J2-M172 Portuguese males (nâ€‰=â€‰74) enabled the detection of the two main subclades at very dissimilar frequencies, J2a-M410 (âˆ¼80%) and J2b-M12 (âˆ¼20%), among which the most common branches were J2a1(xJ2a1b,h)-L26 (22.9%), J2a1b(xJ2a1b1)-M67 (20.3%), J2a1h-L24 (27%), and J2b2-M241 (20.3%).


CONCLUSIONS
While previous inferences based on modern haplogroup J Y-chromosomes implicated a main Neolithic dissemination, here we propose a later arrival of J lineages into Iberia using a combination of novel Portuguese Y-chromosomal data and recent evidence from ancient DNA. Our analysis suggests that a substantial tranche of J1-M267 lineages was likely carried into the Iberian Peninsula as a consequence of the trans-Mediterranean contacts during the first millennium BC, while most of the J2-M172 lineages may be associated with post-Neolithic population movements within Europe.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193490,2017,The Eastern side of the Westernmost Europeans: Insights from subclades within Y-chromosome haplogroup J-M304.,n
1094,"Self-regulation is a dynamic process wherein executive processes (EP) delay, minimize or desist prepotent responses (PR) that arise in situations that threaten well-being. It is generally assumed that, over the course of early childhood, children expand and more effectively deploy their repertoire of EP-related strategies to regulate PR. However, longitudinal tests of these assumptions are scarce in part because self-regulation has been mostly studied as a static construct. This study engages dynamic systems modeling to examine developmental changes in self-regulation between ages 2 and 5 years. Second-by-second time-series data derived from behavioral observations of 112 children (63 boys) faced with novel laboratory-based situations designed to elicit wariness, hesitation, and fear were modeled using differential equation models designed to capture age-related changes in the intrinsic dynamics and bidirectional coupling of PR (fear/wariness) and EP (strategy use). Results revealed that dynamic models allow for the conceptualization and measurement of fear regulation as intrinsic processes as well as direct and indirect coupling between PR and EP. Several patterns of age-related changes were in line with developmental theory suggesting that PR weakened and was regulated more quickly and efficiently by EP at age 5 than at age 2. However, most findings were in the intrinsic dynamics and moderating influences between PR and EP rather than direct influences. The findings illustrate the precision with which specific aspects of self-regulation can be articulated using dynamic systems models, and how such models can be used to describe the development of self-regulation in nuanced and theoretically meaningful ways.",England,Developmental science,29193491,2017,Age-related changes in the dynamics of fear-related regulation in early childhood.,n
1095,"BACKGROUND
Previously, a theoretical model based on microvascular physiology was established to facilitate the interpretation of calf perfusion dynamics recorded by arterial spin labeling (ASL).


PURPOSE
To investigate the clinical relevance of novel perfusion indices by comparing them to the symptoms, response to revascularization, and short-term functional outcome in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).


STUDY TYPE
Prospective cohort study.


POPULATION
Nineteen patients with PAD.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Pulsed ASL at 3T.


ASSESSMENT
The mid-calf reactive hyperemia induced by 2 minutes of arterial occlusion was recorded in PAD patients. The perfusion responses were characterized by the peak, time-to-peak, and physiological model-derived indices including the baseline perfusion fr , arterial resistance Ra , and compliance Ca , and sensitivity gATP and response time Ï„ATP of downstream microvasculature to metabolic stress. These indices were compared to the disease severity and outcome within 6 months after revascularization assessed by self-reported symptoms and the ankle-brachial index. Disease severity was categorized as asymptomatic, claudication, or critical limb ischemia. The outcome was categorized as symptom resolved or limited improvement.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Severity and outcome groups were compared using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests with Holm-Sidak adjustments.


RESULTS
The peak perfusion decreased and model arterial resistance increased progressively with increasing severity of limb ischemia (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0402 and 0.0413, respectively). Eleven patients had a successful endovascular procedure, including six patients who had symptoms resolved, four patients who had remaining leg pain, and one patient lost to follow-up. The subjects with limited improvement had significantly lower preintervention microvascular sensitivity gATP than those with symptoms resolved (8.72â€‰Â±â€‰1.46 vs. 4.93â€‰Â±â€‰0.91, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0466).


DATA CONCLUSION
ASL reactive hyperemia reflects multiple aspects of the pathophysiology. Measures of macrovascular arterial disease are related to the manifested symptom severity, whereas preintervention gATP associated with microvascular dysfunction is related to prognosis following revascularization.

Airflow obstruction, under any condition, could be due to several factors including small airways. PRE and/or BPD could have smaller airways than their counterparts born at full-term (CON) due to a greater degree of dysanaptic airway development during the pre- and/or post-natal period. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the dysanapsis ratio (DR), as an index of airway size, between PRE, BPD, and CON. To do so, we calculated DR in PRE (nÂ =Â 21), BPD (nÂ =Â 14) and CON (nÂ =Â 34) individuals, as well as examined flow-volume loops at rest and during sub-maximal exercise. DR, using multiple estimates of static recoil pressure, was significantly smaller in PRE and BPD (0.16Â Â±Â 0.05 and 0.10Â Â±Â 0.03Â AU) compared to CON (0.22Â Â±Â 0.04Â AU; both PÂ <Â 0.001) and smallest in BPD (PÂ <Â 0.001).

1101,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To examine how shift work affects intensive care nurses' lives outside work.


BACKGROUND
Shift work is unavoidable for many nurses. When attempting to minimise negative effects of shift work it is important to identify areas which affect nurses working shifts.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional study.


METHODS
A questionnaire survey among Danish intensive care nurses concerning experiences with shift work and family life, spare time activities, sleep and health.


RESULTS
A total of 114 nurses (88%) participated. Shift work was found to influence the opportunities for spare time activities, and about 25% of both evening and night shift groups found that working shifts sometimes led to social isolation. A total of 58% of nurses working evening-shifts sometimes to very often experienced having trouble falling asleep when working shifts. Night-shift workers had a higher percentage of physical and mental symptoms when working shifts compared with evening-shift workers, with mood swings and headaches being the most common. The median score for thriving on working shifts was 8 (IQR 5-9) for evening-shift workers and 8 (IQR 7-9) for night-shift workers (scale 0-10 with 10 being the highest level of thriving).


CONCLUSION
Shift workers reported that working shifts had a negative impact on life outside work. Opportunities for participating in spare time activities and difficulties falling asleep after shifts were the main issues for evening-shift workers, whereas physical symptoms such as headaches and mood swings were more dominant among night-shift workers. Despite the negative effects, the participants generally thrived on working shifts.

In the era of neurological subspecialization, most neurologists will have a field of specialist interest. The aim of this cross-sectional multi-national study was to identify the key areas of interest among trainees or junior specialists, assess the potential influence of an interest in research, and consider the results in light of population needs.


METHODS
A total of 300 residents and junior neurologists who received a bursary to attend the European Academy of Neurology conference were invited to participate in this study. Demographic and work-related characteristics, as well as main subspecialty of choice were examined via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Participants holding a higher degree (PhD/MD) or working in research posts were considered research oriented.


RESULTS
In total, 191 Neurologists in training or junior specialists responded (response rate 63.7%). Full data were available for 187 participants (59.4% females). The study sample had a mean age of 30.5Â±3.4 years (range 25 - 45). The most popular subspecialty was movement disorders (18.2%), followed by multiple sclerosis (11.2%) and epilepsy (10.2%). This did not differ significantly between the participants who were or were not research-oriented.

FOXP3 encodes a transcription factor critical for T regulatory cell function and mutations are known to cause ""immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy (including insulin-requiring diabetes), enteropathy, X-linked"" (IPEX) syndrome. This condition is often fatal unless patients receive a bone-marrow transplant. Here we describe the phenotype of male neonates and infants who had insulin-requiring diabetes without other features of IPEX syndrome and were found to have mutations in FOXP3. Whole-exome or next generation sequencing of genes of interest was carried out in subjects with isolated neonatal diabetes without a known genetic cause. RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the effects on RNA splicing of a novel intronic splice-site variant. Four male subjects were found to have FOXP3 variants in the hemizygous state: p.Arg114Trp, p.Arg347His, p.Lys393Met, and c.1044+5G>A which was detected in 2 unrelated probands and in a brother diagnosed with diabetes at 2.1â€‰years of age.

Thanks to rapid penetration of mobile tools, more and more cancer survivors have adopted mobile-based patient-provider communication (MBPPC). The relationship between MBPPC and patients' health outcomes, however, remains unclear; how health literacy and patient activation interact with such relationship is unexplored.


METHODS
Data were drawn from National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 4 Cycle 3. A sample of 459 cancer survivors were included in the analysis. Based on the three-stage model of health promotion using interactive media, this study empirically tested a moderated mediation model.


RESULTS
MBPPC (e.g., patient use of email, text message, mobile app, and social media to communicate with providers) had no direct effect on cancer survivors' emotional health. Instead, health literacy completely mediated this path. Patient activation positively moderated the effect of health literacy on emotional health, and further increased the indirect effect of MBPPC on emotional health.


CONCLUSIONS
MBPPC alone does not directly result in better emotional health outcomes; health literacy is the key to realize its health benefits; patient activation significantly strengthens the effects of MBPPC. As we embrace the mHealth movement, innovative programs are needed to promote MBPPC, and improve health literacy and activation of cancer survivors, particularly in underserved communities, to reduce health disparities.",England,Psycho-oncology,29193503,2017,Mobile-based patient-provider communication in cancer survivors: the roles of health literacy and patient activation.,n
1107,"OBJECTIVES
No studies have focused on socioeconomic disparities in obesity within and between cohorts. Our objectives were to examine income gradients in obesity between birth-cohorts (inter-cohort variations) and within each birth-cohort (intra-cohort variations) by gender and race/ethnicity.


METHODS
Our sample includes 56,820 white and black adults from pooled, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1971-2012). We fit a series of logistic hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models to control for the effects of age and period, simultaneously. Predicted probabilities of obesity by poverty-to-income ratio were estimated and graphed for 5-year cohort groups from 1901-1990. We also stratified this relationship for four gender and racial/ethnic subgroups.


RESULTS
Obesity disparities due to income were weaker for post-World War I and II generations, specifically the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s to 1950s cohorts, than for other cohorts. In contrast, we found greater income gradients in obesity among cohorts from the 1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to 1970s. Moreover, obesity disparities due to income across cohorts vary markedly by gender and race/ethnicity. White women with higher income consistently exhibited a lower likelihood of obesity than those with lower income since early 1900s cohorts; whereas, black men with higher income exhibited higher risks of obesity than those with lower income in most cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that strategies that address race and/or gender inequalities in obesity should be cognizant of significant historical factors that may be unique to cohorts. Period-based approaches that ignore life-course experiences captured in significant cohort-based experiences may limit the utility of policies and interventions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193504,2017,Cohort-based income gradients in obesity among U.S. adults.,y

This study proposed and tested a structural model to explain and predict family empowerment in families of children with special needs.


BACKGROUND
Family empowerment of families of children with special needs can be explained using the Double ABCX model. Although constant stressors such as parenting stress and family demands can have negative effects on family empowerment, family resources and parenting efficacy can mediate the negative effect through effective coping strategies.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional research design was employed.


METHODS
A survey was conducted with 240 parents of children with special needs. Upon exclusion of 4 responses deemed inadequate to the statistics process, 236 responses were selected for the analysis. Based on the items used in the previous research, we used the scale of family demands 38, the scale of parenting stress 24, the scale of parenting efficacy 37, the scale of pattern of organization 30, the scale of communication process 16, and the scale of family empowerment 32.


RESULTS
In families of children with special needs, parenting stress had a negative effect on parenting efficacy and family resources, namely, pattern of organization and communication process. Family needs had a positive effect on parenting efficacy. Parenting stress and family demands influenced family empowerment through parenting efficacy and family resources (pattern of organization and communication process), while parenting efficacy contributed to family empowerment.


CONCLUSIONS
This study empirically analyzed the usefulness of the Double ABCX model in predicting family empowerment. Family resource factors (organization pattern and communication process) and perception or judgement factors (such as parenting efficacy) were found to mediate the negative impact of various stressors experienced by families of children with special needs.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study findings suggest that clinical practice and management should focus on providing efficient intervention methods to lower stress in families of children with special needs. Reinforcing factors contributing to family empowerment, such as parenting efficacy, organization pattern, and communication process will alleviate families' stress, resulting in a positive educational and developmental impact on children with special needs.

Akathisia is a common and severely disabling medication-induced movement disorder. The condition is often missed, and patients suffer for a long time until diagnosed and managed properly. It is important to bring awareness to the clinicians for early detection and management of akathisia.


METHODS
We reviewed four years record of patients seen at a comprehensive cancer center for anxiety and restlessness. Patients diagnosed with akathisia and the medications causing akathisia were identified. Management of akathisia discussed.


RESULTS
Study showed that about 4.7% of the patients developed akathisia while taking anti-emetic agents to control chemotherapy induced nausea/vomiting. Early detection and management of akathisia resulted in quick recovery and reduced patients' suffering.


CONCLUSION
Akathisia is an unpleasant feeling of motor restlessness with anxiety.

1111,"BACKGROUND
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) combining different techniques such as MR elastography (MRE) has emerged as a noninvasive approach to diagnose and stage liver fibrosis with high accuracy allowing for anatomical and functional information.


PURPOSE
To assess the diagnostic performance of mpMRI including qualitative and quantitative assessment of MRE, liver surface nodularity (LSN) measurement, hepatic enhancement ratios postgadoxetic acid, and serum markers (APRI, FIB-4) for the detection of liver fibrosis.


STUDY TYPE
IRB-approved retrospective.


SUBJECTS
Eighty-three adult patients.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
1.5T and 3.0T MR systems. MRE and T1 -weighted postgadoxetic acid sequences.


ASSESSMENT
Two independent observers analyzed qualitative color-coded MRE maps on a scale of 0-3. Regions of interest were drawn to measure liver stiffness on MRE stiffness maps and on pre- and postcontrast T1 -weighted images to measure hepatic enhancement ratios. Software was used to generate LSN measurements. Histopathology was used as the reference standard for diagnosis of liver fibrosis in all patients.


STATISTICAL TESTS
A multivariable logistic analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of liver fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated the performance of each imaging technique for detection of fibrosis, in comparison with serum markers.


RESULTS
Liver stiffness measured with MRE provided the strongest correlation with histopathologic fibrosis stage (râ€‰=â€‰0.74, P < 0.001), and the highest diagnostic performance for detection of stages F2-F4, F3-F4, and F4 (areas under the curve [AUCs] of 0.87, 0.91, and 0.89, respectively, P < 0.001) compared to other methods. Qualitative assessment of MRE maps showed fair to good accuracy for detection of fibrosis (AUC range 0.76-0.84). Multivariable logistic analysis identified liver stiffness and FIB-4 as independent predictors of fibrosis with AUCs of 0.90 (F2-F4), 0.93 (F3-F4) and 0.92 (F4) when combined.


DATA CONCLUSION
Liver stiffness measured with MRE showed the best performance for detection of liver fibrosis compared to LSN and gadoxetic acid uptake, with slight improvement when combined with FIB-4.

There is limited literature on haemodialysis in island countries in the Central Pacific. The primary aim of this study was to report on the epidemiology of haemodialysis patients and haemodialysis performance in Nauru.


METHODS
We obtained registry data from the haemodialysis unit in Nauru to calculate the incidence rate, prevalence, and survival probability of haemodialysis patients in Nauru. We also reviewed medical records from January 2015 to February 2017 to evaluate the haemodialysis performance in Nauru.


RESULTS
In total, 177 patients received long-term haemodialysis in the Nauru dialysis unit from 1987 to 2017. The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival probabilities during the 30-year study period were 76.5%, 58.3% and 25.9%, respectively. From 2011 to 2014, the incidence rate and prevalence of treated end-stage renal disease in Nauru were significantly higher than Australia. From 2015 to 2017, there were 36 patients with a median age of 55 years who received long-term haemodialysis. Of these, 25 patients (69.4%) had diabetes. The median haemoglobin, serum albumin, and urea reduction ratio were 9.6 mg/dL, 35 g/L, and 64.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that lower serum albumin and lower urea reduction ratio were associated with mortality.


CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the haemodialysis status in Nauru. The epidemiology of haemodialysis patients in Nauru is unique in Central Pacific.

1115,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Despite its clinical and prognostic significance, few studies have evaluated the severity of exertional oxygen desaturation in fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD). Our objectives were to identify clinical and physiological variables that predict the extent of exertional oxygen desaturation in fibrotic ILD and to quantify the severity of desaturation compared to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


METHODS
This retrospective study compared the results of 6-min walk test (6MWT) performed while breathing room air in fibrotic ILD patients and COPD patients eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation. Outcomes included the oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) nadir and the change in SpO2 from rest during a 6MWT. Predictor variables were identified on unadjusted analysis, followed by multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of desaturation.


RESULTS
The study included 134 patients with fibrotic ILD and 274 patients with COPD. The ILD and COPD cohorts had similar age, sex, frequency of major comorbidities, walk distance, baseline SpO2 and baseline Borg dyspnoea scores. DLCO was the strongest predictor of desaturation in both cohorts. Compared to patients with COPD, ILD patients had significantly lower SpO2 nadir values (88.1â€‰Â±â€‰6.4 vs 91.0â€‰Â±â€‰4.6) and greater decrease in SpO2 from baseline (7.4â€‰Â±â€‰5.2 vs 4.5â€‰Â±â€‰3.7) after adjusting for demographic features and pulmonary physiology (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0005), with greater between-group differences at lower DLCO values.


CONCLUSION

The aims of this concept analysis are to elucidate the terminology associated with preceptorships, articulate an operational description of preceptorship that may be useful in formalizing the precepting process, and provide guidance for constructing a clinical environment where precepting can thrive.


BACKGROUND
Precepting facilitates the transition of nurses into new roles. Precepting may improve patient outcomes and safety, as well as enhance nursing satisfaction. Most research focuses on preceptor preparation and perceptions. A comprehensive operational description of what is required to formalize the precepting process is missing from the literature.


DESIGN
This concept analysis was completed by using a combination of Walker and Avant's and Rodger's methods.


METHODS
Existing literature relating to preceptorship was reviewed. Critical attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents were identified. Model, contrary, related, and borderline cases were developed.


RESULTS
Preceptorships have the specific attributes of being (1) one-on-one relationships (2) embedded within formalized programs (3) that evolve over set amounts of time (4) to systematically facilitate practical experiences. Antecedents include how precepting is triggered and organizational supporting activities that may facilitate effective precepting. Consequences include new hire preparedness, confidence, and increased retention. Empirical referents are provided for assessing hands-on clinical expertise, individualization of precepting programs, and the preceptor-preceptee relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
This concept analysis provides a holistic view of the precepting process that shifts the focus from the people or checklist to formalized preceptorships.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Continuity throughout an organization's system streamlines the process of hiring new employees and transitioning nursing students to practice. Organizational policies, dedicated resources, and engagement in systematically improving the precepting process are critical.

1117,It is demonstrated that differential scanning calorimetry can measure the kinetics of the thermally initiated polymerization during continuous cooling. The measurements are accomplished by switching from fast heating to much slower cooling. The study is exemplified by crosslinking polymerization (curing) of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy and m-phenylenediamine taken in stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric ratios and measured under heating and cooling conditions. An advanced isoconversional method reveals that the reaction in the nonstoichiometric system follows the kinetics of the single-step type. Its activation energy is constant and the same for heating and cooling conditions. The stoichiometric system exhibits the multistep kinetics characterized by the dependencies of the activation energy on temperature that differ qualitatively for cooling and heating runs. The discovered differences emphasize the need for further systematic studies of the thermal polymerization during continuous cooling.,Germany,Macromolecular rapid communications,29193514,2017,Kinetics of Thermal Polymerization Can Be Studied during Continuous Cooling.,n

Severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) is a major cause of disability and mortality in young adults. Clinical pathways endeavour to bring evidence and clinical practice closer together to foster the delivery of best practice and to improve patient outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
To compare the effectiveness of clinical pathway directed care to usual care on hospitalisation-related outcomes in patients with STBI.


DESIGN
Quasi-experimental study.


METHODS
The study was conducted in a trauma Intensive Care Unit of a large teaching hospital in Egypt. Patients aged 18-60 years with a diagnosis of STBI, a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 3 and 8 and a non-penetrating head injury, were consecutively assigned to 15 days of care. The outcomes assessed were complications related to hospitalization, clinical variances, length of ICU stay, ICU readmission rate, and patient/family satisfaction.


RESULTS
Sixty participants completed the study (30 in each arm). Apart from age, there were no significant differences between groups in baseline characteristics. The clinical pathway group demonstrated statistically significantly fewer cases of hospitalisation-related complications at day 15, and a significantly shorter length of ICU stay, lower ICU readmission rate, and a high level of patient/family satisfaction when compared with the usual care group. The effect of the intervention on fever, pressure ulceration, hyperglycaemia and re-admission to the ICU was no longer statistically significant after controlling for age.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings of the current study suggest that the implementation of a clinical pathway for patients with severe TBI may be helpful in improving the patient experience as well as some hospitalisation-related outcomes.

1120,"Designing new antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) focuses heavily on the activity of the peptide and less on the elements that stabilize the secondary structure of these peptides. Studies have shown that improving the structure of naturally occurring AMPs can affect activity and so here we explore the relationship between structure and activity of two non-naturally occurring AMPs. We have used a backbone-cyclized peptide as a template and designed an uncyclized analogue of this peptide that has antimicrobial activity. We focused on beta-hairpin-like structuring features. Improvements to the structure of this peptide reduced the activity of the peptide against gram-negative, Escherichia coli but improved the activity against gram-positive, Corynebacterium glutamicum. Distinctions in structuring effects on gram-negative versus gram-positive activity were also seen in a second peptide system. Structural improvements resulted in a peptide that was more active than the native against gram-positive bacterium but less active against gram-negative bacterium. Our results show that there is not always a correlation between improved hairpin-structuring and activity. Other factors such as the type of bacteria being targeted as well as net positive charge can play a role in the potency of AMPs.

In the elderly, impaired cognition may weaken medication adherence and compromise treatment for cardiovascular disease (CVD).


AIMS
We examined risk factors for medication adherence and the relationship between adherence and levels of CVD risk factors among older participants with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes in the Framingham Heart Study.


METHODS
The four-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was administered to 1,559 participants, median age 70 years, 53% women. We created an adherence score, ranging from 0-4, with low adherence defined as a score â‰¥2. CVD risk factors were assessed using standard protocols. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) scale.


RESULTS
Among participants who self-reported taking antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and/or hyperglycemic medication(s), 12% (n=191) had low medication adherence. The risk of low adherence increased by 45% (9%CI: 25-68%, P<0.001) per five-unit increase in CES-D score. In participants taking antihypertensive medication (n=1,017), low adherence was associated with higher mean diastolic blood pressure (73 mmHg, 95%CI: 71-75 vs. 71 mmHg, 95CI: 70-71; P=0.04) after adjusting for covariates.

This information is important to not only allow more accurate identification and differentiation of disease, but it may also be useful in assessing pancreatic function. In this prospective analytical study, we described a triple phase CT protocol of the pancreas for use in sedated cats and the attenuation, enhancement pattern, size, and volume of the pancreas for a group of healthy cats. Fifteen healthy cats were enrolled in the study and a standardized protocol for acquiring arterial, portal, and delayed phase CT images of the pancreas was developed and described. The pancreas was hypo to isoattenuating to both the liver and spleen in all phases in the majority of cats with a homogenous enhancement pattern noted in all 15. Mean pancreatic attenuation was 48, 79, 166, and 126Â Hounsfield units (HU) respectively on precontrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phase images.

1130,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To investigate the application of a telemedicine intervention in diabetes foot ulcer care, and its implications for the health care professionals in the clinical field.


BACKGROUND
Contextual factors are found to be important when applying technology in health care and applying telemedicine in home-based care has been identified as particularly complex.


DESIGN AND METHODS
We conducted field observations and individual interviews among health care professionals in home-based care and specialist health care in a diabetes foot care telemedicine RCT (Clin.Trial. gov: NCT01710774) during 2016. The current study was guided by Interpretive Description, an inductive qualitative methodology.


RESULTS
Overall, we identified unequal possibilities for applying telemedicine in diabetes foot ulcer care within the hospital and home care contexts. Different circumstances and possibilities in home-based care made the application of telemedicine as intended more difficult. The health care professionals in both care contexts perceived the application of telemedicine to facilitate a more comprehensive approach towards the patients, but with different possibilities to enact it.


CONCLUSIONS
Application of telemedicine in home-based care was more challenging than in the outpatient clinic setting. Introducing more updated equipment and minor structural adjustments in consultation time and resources could make the use of telemedicine in home-based care more robust.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Application of telemedicine in diabetes foot ulcer follow up may enhance the nursing staff's ability to conduct comprehensive assessment and care of the foot ulcer as well as the patient's total situation. Access to adequate equipment and time, particularly in home-based care, is necessary to capitalize on this new technology. This article is protected by copyright.

1131,"In this study, we aimed to investigate relaxant effect of flavanol (-)-epicatechin on the isolated human saphenous vein (HSV), as a part of its cardioprotective action, and to define the mechanisms underlying this vasorelaxation. (-)-Epicatechin induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of HSV pre-contracted by phenylephrine. Among K+ channel blockers, 4-aminopyridine, margatoxin, and iberiotoxin significantly inhibited relaxation of HSV, while glibenclamide considerably reduced effects of the high concentrations of (-)-epicatechin. Additionally, (-)-epicatechin relaxed contraction induced by 80Â mM K+ , whereas in the presence of nifedipine produced partial relaxation of HSV rings pre-contracted by phenylephrine. In Ca2+ -free solution, (-)-epicatechin relaxed contraction induced by phenylephrine, but had no effect on contraction induced by caffeine. A sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, significantly reduced relaxation of HSV produced by (-)-epicatechin. These results demonstrate that (-)-epicatechin produces endothelium-independent relaxation of isolated HSV rings. Vasorelaxation to (-)-epicatechin probably involves activation of 4-aminopyridine- and margatoxin-sensitive KV channels, BKCa channels, and at least partly, KATP channels. In addition, not only the inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ influx, but regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ release, via inositol-trisphosphate receptors and reuptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum, via stimulation of Ca2+ -ATPase, as well, most likely participate in (-)-epicatechin-induced relaxation of HSV.",England,Phytotherapy research : PTR,29193528,2017,(-)-Epicatechin-induced relaxation of isolated human saphenous vein: Roles of K+ and Ca2+ channels.,n
1132,"BACKGROUND
Doppler ultrasonography can be used to assess the progression of vascular (arterial sclerosis) and parenchymal (glomerular sclerosis and crescents) renal damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of some sonographic and Doppler parameters as non-invasive markers of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal histopathological damage in children.


METHODOLOGY
A cohort of 84 children were enrolled in a case-control study (42 with CKD stages 2-5 and 42 healthy children). GFR was assessed using new improved equation using serum creatinine and cystatin C. Sonar guided renal specimen was obtained and evaluated for the severity of global sclerosis (GS), segmental sclerosis (SS), tubular artrophy (TA), interstitial fibrosis (IF), arterial sclerosis (AS) and arteriolar hyalinosis (AH). The following sonographic and Doppler parameters were assessed in both patients and control group: resistivity index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), Atrophic index (AI), mean renal volume, mean renal density, time average velocity (TAV) and body surface area related volume perfusion (BSARVP).


RESULTS
There was significant difference in renal density (p<0.001), RI (p<0.001), PI (p=0.021), TAV (p<0.001) and BSARVP (p<0.001) between patients and control group. The cutoff value of RI was 63.5% (sensitivity 83% and specificity 64%). Multivariate analysis revealed that renal density and RI were significant predictors of worsening of eGFR in CKD patients.


CONCLUSION
Any increase in the RI and PI values must arouse alarm to the possibility of advancing renal damage. Moreover, RI and PI could fairly predict the degree of glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis.",Australia,"Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",29193529,2017,Renal ultrasound and Doppler parameters as markers of renal function and histopathological damage in children with CKD.,n

1136,"OBJECTIVES
To analyze whether living conditions, experienced by mothers and adult daughters during their childhood, are associated with age at menarche (AAM) in daughters.


METHODS
From September, 2011, to January, 2014, AAM and childhood living conditions were collected from a sample of 246 dyads of Maya mothers (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰59.60 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.64) and their adult daughters (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰33.03 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰5.57) from the cities of Merida and Motul in Yucatan, Mexico. Indicators of childhood living conditions were number of siblings and quality of house construction materials in both generations, and father's absence among daughters in their pre-menarcheal years. Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between childhood conditions in mother-daughter dyads and daughter's AAM.


RESULTS
The recalled mean AAM of adult Maya daughters was 12.05 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.53). After adjusting for the influence of mothers' AAM, number of siblings in both the mothers' and daughters' families directly predicted daughters' AAM (more siblings was associated with a later AAM); and a higher (better) index of household conditions in mothers' childhood was associated with earlier AAM in daughters. The household conditions index during the childhood of daughters and father's absence were not associated with their AAM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that better living conditions experienced by the mothers and daughters during their childhood may lower mean AAM in daughters in the context of populations that show important intergenerational changes in their social and economic conditions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193533,2017,"Living conditions and change in age of menarche in adult Maya mothers and daughters from Yucatan, Mexico.",y

Eligible patients (N=27,820) were followed until HCC occurrence, completion of the allowed 3-year regimen, or December 31, 2013. During a median follow-up of 25.1 (12.1-35.6) months, 802 patients developed HCC, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative incidence of 1.82% (95% CI, 1.66-1.99%), 3.05% (95% CI, 2.82-3.28%), and 4.06% (95% CI, 3.77-4.36%), respectively.

We estimate associations between e-cigarette prices (both disposable and refill) and e-cigarette use among middle and high school students in the United States. We also estimate associations between cigarette prices and e-cigarette use.


DESIGN
We use regression models to estimate the associations between e-cigarette and cigarette prices and e-cigarette use. In our regression models, we exploit changes in e-cigarette and cigarette prices across four periods of time and across 50 markets. We report the associations as price elasticities. In our primary model, we control for socio-demographic characteristics, cigarette prices, tobacco control policies, market fixed effects, and year-quarter fixed effects.


SETTING
United States of America.


PARTICIPANTS
24,370 middle and high school students participating in the Monitoring the Future Survey in years 2014 and 2015.


MEASUREMENTS
Self-reported e-cigarette use over the last 30 days. Average quarterly cigarette prices, e-cigarette disposable prices, and e-cigarette refill prices were constructed from Nielsen retail data (inclusive of excise taxes) for 50 U.S. markets.


FINDINGS
In a model with market fixed effects, we estimate that a 10% increase in e-cigarette disposable prices is associated with a reduction in the number of days vaping among e-cigarette users by approximately 9.7% (95% CI = -17.7% to 1.8%; p=0.02) and is associated with a reduction in the number of days vaping by the full sample by approximately 17.9% (95% CI=-31.5% to -4.2%; p=0.01). Refill e-cigarette prices were not statistically significant predictors of vaping. Cigarette prices were not significantly associated with e-cigarette use regardless of the e-cigarette price used. However, in a model without market fixed effects, cigarette prices were a statistically significant positive predictor of total e-cigarette use.

Soy and soy-related products have been found to help prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer.

1143,"BACKGROUND
The global rise in incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is too rapid to be attributed to susceptible genetic background, pinpointing a significant role for environmental factors. Unlike the theory that the need for genetic susceptibility has lessened over time, we hypothesized that the rise in T1D incidence is faster in a genetically susceptible population.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study population comprised of 5080 patients aged 0 to 17 years who were reported to the National Israel Diabetes Registry between 1997 and 2014. The patients were divided into familial cases (first-degree relative has T1D), and sporadic cases. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the registry. The change in annual percent (from the entire cohort) was computed separately for the sporadic and familial cohorts.


RESULTS
The familial (nâ€‰=â€‰546; 10.7%) and sporadic (nâ€‰=â€‰4534; 89.3%) cases were comparable for gender, ethnicity, and age at diagnosis. Consanguinity was more common in the familial vs sporadic group (10% vs 6.1%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.001). The average annual percent change increased by 1.9% in the familial cases and decreased by 0.2% in the sporadic cases (Pâ€‰=â€‰.04).


CONCLUSIONS
The rapid rise in the proportion of familial cases of T1D suggests that environmental factors impose higher diabetogenic pressure in patients with a susceptible genetic background.",Denmark,Pediatric diabetes,29193540,2017,The proportion of familial cases of type 1 diabetes is increasing simultaneously with the disease incidence: Eighteen years of the Israeli Pediatric Diabetes Registry.,n
1144,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum) has low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The genetic mechanisms controlling NUE are unknown. Positional cloning of a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for N-related agronomic traits showed that the vernalization gene TaVRN-A1 was tightly linked with TaNUE1, the gene shown to influence NUE in wheat. Because of an Ala180 /Val180 substitution, TaVRN-A1a and TaVRN-A1b proteins interact differentially with TaANR1, a protein encoded by a wheat orthologue of Arabidopsis nitrate regulated 1 (ANR1). The transcripts of both TaVRN-A1 and TaANR1 were down-regulated by nitrogen. TaANR1 was functionally characterized in TaANR1::RNAi transgenic wheat, and in a natural mutant with a 23-bp deletion including 10 bp at the 5' end of intron 5 and 13 bp exon 6 in gDNA sequence in its gDNA sequence, which produced transcript that lacked the full 84-bp exon 6. Both TaANR1 and TaHOX1 bound to the Ala180 /Val180 position of TaVRN-A1. Genetically incorporating favorable alleles from TaVRN-A1, TaANR1, and TaHOX1 increased grain yield from 9.84% to 11.58% in the field.

We conducted a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the performance of quantitative fibrous collagen parameters (q-FP) in the assessment. Data sets from a prior CHB trial (NCT00962533) with mostly mild-to-moderate fibrosis participants were used for this study. 301 subjects with paired liver biopsies were consecutively included. Of these, 139 subjects were used to establish the test and the rest for internal validation. Fibrosis change between baseline and week 104 of treatment was blindly assessed with q-FP and was compared with Ishak fibrosis staging. There were 70% and 93% subjects with Ishak F0-2 at baseline and week 104, respectively. For the test of the subjects, q-FP and Ishak staging showed no difference in determining the incidence of fibrosis regression (68% vs. 67%; difference=0.7%, p=1.00). Q-FP demonstrated that the regression was independently associated with the antiviral efficacy endpoint (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.4-6.5, p=0.005), but Ishak failed the detection (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-1.3, p=0.24). Moreover, q-FP directly revealed a higher fibrosis-resistance to antiviral treatment in virus genotypes C versus B and in males versus females. These results were confirmed in the validation subjects. Additionally, a functional model built on the test subjects showed an accuracy of 82% in stratifying fibrosis-reversibility of the validation subjects.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telbivudine used during late pregnancy for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HBV. We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study in five hospitals from 2012-2014, which enrolled HBV-infected singleton pregnant women with positive HBeAg. By their choice, women were divided into therapy (telbivudine 600 mg/day, from gestation 28-32 weeks to 3-4 weeks postpartum) and control (no antiviral agent) groups. Infants received passive-active immunoprophylaxis and follow-up at the age of 7-14 months. Totally 328 pregnant women were included; 149 in the telbivudine group and 179 in the control group. Baseline HBV DNA levels were similar in the two groups (7.43 vs. 7.37 log10 IU/ml, P = 0.711). At delivery, HBV DNA levels in the telbivudine and control groups were 3.80 and 7.26 log10 IU/ml respectively (P <0.0001). Of the infants, 128 (85.9%) in the telbivudine group and 156 (87.2%) in the control group were followed up. No infant in the telbivudine group had chronic infection, while 2 (1.28%) infants in the control group did (P = 0.503). Three (2.34%) infants in the telbivudine group, but none in the control group, had severe congenital or developmental abnormalities (P = 0.090). The data indicate that telbivudine may block perinatal HBV transmission.

To describe the 'Resuscitation with Pre-HospItaL bLood products' trial (RePHILL)Â -Â a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of pre-hospital blood product (PHBP) administration vs standard care for traumatic haemorrhage.


BACKGROUND
PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components.


METHODS
RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressureâ€‰<90â€‰mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include ageâ€‰<16â€‰years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1â€‰:Â 1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250â€‰mL 0.9% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of â‰¥20%/h over the first 2â€‰hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity.


RESULTS
Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020.

1152,"We estimated the total number of undiagnosed HBV and HCV carriers and patients with hepatitis virus-related disease in Japan according to six different groups classified by their natural histories during 2011. In 2011, the total number of carriers and patients infected with HBV or HCV was estimated according to six groups using government reports and reports from the hepatitis epidemiology research group of The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. In 2011, the total number of hepatitis virus carriers was estimated to be 2,090,128-2,840,128 in which the estimated number of undiagnosed HCV and HBV carriers was 776,826 (HBV: 481,470; HCV: 295,356). The total number of treated patients, as either inpatients or outpatients, was estimated to be 11,588 (HBV: 303,366; HCV: 520,600) in 2011. It is presumed that many carriers shirk consultation for many reasons, such as patients' misunderstanding, lack of awareness, forgetfulness of their positive status. The numbers of infected patients who did not seek treatment increased gradually to 501,714-1,251,714 (HBV: 333,791-483,791; HCV: 167,923-767,923) in 2011. Compared to 2000, the number of undiagnosed carriers was significantly reduced in 2011 probably because of the well-organized, effective national hepatitis virus screening system that has been launched by the Japanese government since 2002. Moreover, the increase in the number of untreated persons who are aware of their positive status shows that more effort should be invested in improving the referral system from screening centers to core hospitals.

1153,"Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, 'boom-and-bust' demography, hybridization, and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure, and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation, and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C. santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C. santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker, and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

To utilize a three-tiered approach to provide insight into the microbial community structure, the spatial distribution and the metabolic capabilities of organisms of a biofilm in the two towers of a high rate biological contact reactor treating winery wastewater.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Next generation sequencing indicated that bacteria primarily responsible for removal of carbohydrates, sugars and alcohol were more abundant in tower 1 than tower 2 while nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were more abundant in tower 2. Yeast populations differed in each tower. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) coupled with confocal microscopy showed distribution of organisms confirming an oxygen gradient across the biofilm depth. The Biolog system (ECO plates) specified the different carbon metabolizing profiles of the two biofilms.


CONCLUSIONS
The three-tiered approach confirmed that the addition of a second subunit to the bioreactor, expanded the treatment capacity by augmenting the microbial and metabolic diversity of the system, improving the treatment scope of the system.

Previously, we demonstrated that topically applied phenylephrine, a potent Î±1 adrenergic receptor agonist, can be used to contract the arrector pili muscle of the follicular unit; thus, increasing the force required to pluck hair and reducing shedding during brushing. While demonstrating efficacy, phenylephrine has several drawbacks when applied to the scalp, including the possibility cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that a high concentration of a weak Î±1 agonist would allow for: (a) rapid penetration through the stratum corneum eliciting a quick response; (b) a low probability of cardiac adverse events owing to the low receptor binding affinity; and (c) an efficacy of the weak Î±1 agonist similar to that of phenylephrine at the local site of application. Accordingly, we developed a novel topical solution, AB-102, containing a high concentration of a weak Î±1 agonist. Several studies were conducted to test the safety and efficacy of AB-102. In a dose escalating safety study, utilizing a wearable holter monitor, we observed no cardiac or hemodynamic adverse events. In addition, in a controlled efficacy study, AB-102 reduced the number of hairs shed during brushing by up to 77% (average of 38%).",United States,Dermatologic therapy,29193553,2017,Styling without shedding: Novel topical formula reduces hair shedding by contracting the arrector pili muscle.,n
1157,"PURPOSE
Near real-time vaccine safety surveillance (NRTVSS) using electronic health records has been used to detect timely vaccine safety signals. Trial implementation of NRTVSS using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) has shown that there is limited power to detect safety signals for rare events. Delays in recording outcomes and receiving data influence the power and timeliness to identify a signal. Our work aimed to compare how different sources of delays influence power and expected time to signal to implement NRTVSS using CPRD.


METHODS
We studied seasonal influenza vaccine/Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and performed power and expected time to signal calculations for the 2013-2014/2014-2015 seasons. We used the Poisson-based maximised sequential probability ratio test, which compares observed-to-expected events. For each study season, we obtained an average Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome/seizures age-sex-adjusted rate from the 5 previous seasons and then used this rate to calculate the expected number of events, assuming a 42-day risk-window. Calculations were performed for detecting rate ratios of 1.5 to 10. We compared power and timeliness considering combinations of the presence/absence of delays in recording outcomes and in receiving data. The R-package Sequential was used.


RESULTS
In general, there was â‰¥80% power to detect increases in risk of â‰¥4 at the end of the season. Assuming absence of delays slightly improved power (a maximum increase of 4%) but did not noticeably reduce time to detect a signal.


CONCLUSION
Removing delays in data availability is insufficient to significantly improve the performance of a NRTVSS system using CPRD. Expansion of CPRD data is required. KEY POINTS The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) can be used to implement near real-time vaccine safety surveillance, but there is limited power to detect signals for rare outcomes. Delays in recording outcomes and in receiving data might limit power and timeliness of a system. We assessed the influence of these sources of delays to inform data providers of the steps required to improve a system using CPRD data. Removing delays in recording outcomes and receiving data is unlikely to significantly improve the performance of a system using CPRD data.

1160,"BACKGROUND
To meet the challenge of multimorbidity in decision making, a switch from a disease-oriented to a goal-oriented approach could be beneficial for patients and clinicians. More insight about the concept and the implementation of this approach in clinical practice is needed.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to develop conceptual descriptions of goal-oriented care by examining the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) and clinical geriatricians (CGs), and how the concept relates to collaborative communication and shared decision making with elderly patients with multimorbidity.


METHOD
Qualitative interviews with GPs and CGs were conducted and analyzed using thematic analysis.


RESULTS
Clinicians distinguished disease- or symptom-specific goals, functional goals and a new type of goals, which we labelled as fundamental goals. ""Fundamental goals"" are goals specifying patient's priorities in life, related to their values and core relationships. These fundamental goals can be considered implicitly or explicitly in decision making or can be ignored. Reasons to explicate goals are the potential mismatch between medical standards and patient preferences and the need to know individual patient values in case of multimorbidity, including the management in acute situations.


CONCLUSION
Based on the perspectives of clinicians, we expanded the concept of goal-oriented care by identifying a three-level goal hierarchy. This model could facilitate collaborative goal-setting for patients with multiple long-term conditions in clinical practice. Future research is needed to refine and validate this model and to provide specific guidance for medical training and practice.",England,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,29193557,2017,A three-goal model for patients with multimorbidity: A qualitative approach.,n

Several treatment options exist for the implant-supported rehabilitation of edentulous posterior maxilla.


PURPOSE
To compare maxillary sinus floor augmentation associated to standard length implants, with direct placement of implants of reduced length in the available residual bone.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with edentulous posterior maxilla and a residual height of 4-7 mm were randomly allocated to the test (short implants [SIs], 6.5 to 8.5mm long) or the control (sinus augmentation [SA] and implants â‰¥10mm long) group. Anorganic bovine bone was the grafting material for the control group. In both groups pure platelet-rich plasma was used to bioactivate implant surface prior to insertion. Implant and prosthesis survival, clinical variables, radiographic bone level change, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were assessed.


RESULTS
Twenty-five patients were treated in the control group (58 standard length implants) and 27 in the test group (42 SIs). After 3 years of follow-up no implant failure and biological or mechanical complications were recorded. Marginal bone loss, soft tissue, and oral hygiene parameters were similar in the 2 groups at both 1 and 3 years' follow-up. Postoperative pain, swelling and other symptoms and daily activities were better in the SIs group than in the SA group, while patients' satisfaction after 1 year was similar.


CONCLUSIONS

To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of exenatide once-weekly (EQW) compared to basal insulin (BI) among injectable-naÃ¯ve T2DM patients who are elderly or have renal impairment (RI).


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Initiators of EQW and BI with T2DM were identified from 2012-2015 within a United States electronic health record database and matched by propensity score. Matched EQW and BI initiators aged 65+ years or who have RI were compared. Weight, HbA1c, eGFR, blood pressure, and lipids were obtained at baseline and quarterly (Q1-Q4) or semi-annually for one year following drug initiation. Hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal symptoms were identified using diagnosis codes and data abstracted from clinical notes.


RESULTS
Among patients aged 65+ years, HbA1c changed by -0.50 and -0.31 percentage points from baseline to Q4 for EQW and BI initiators, respectively. Weight changed by -1.6 kg among EQW initiators compared to 0.2 kg among BI initiators. Compared to BI initiators, EQW initiators had a 1.45-fold increased risk of nausea and vomiting. Among RI patients, HbA1c changed by -0.58 and -0.33 percentage points from baseline to Q4 for EQW and BI initiators, respectively. Weight changed by -1.9 kg for EQW initiators while BI initiators had no change in weight. EQW initiators had a 1.28-fold increased risk of constipation and diarrhea compared to BI initiators.

Elevated serum uric acid concentration (SUA) has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but this may be due to unmeasured confounders. We examined the association between SUA and outcomes as well as the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on SUA in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in PARADIGM-HF.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The association between SUA and the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization, its components, and all-cause mortality was examined using Cox regression analyses among 8213 patients using quintiles (Q1-Q5) of SUA adjusted for baseline prognostic variables including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), diuretic dose, and log N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Change in SUA from baseline over 12â€‰months was also evaluated in each treatment group. Patients in Q5 (SUA â‰¥8.6â€‰mg/dL) compared with Q1 (<5.4â€‰mg/dL) were younger (62.8 vs. 64.2â€‰years), more often male (88.7% vs. 63.1%), had lower systolic blood pressure (119 vs. 123â€‰mmHg), lower eGFR (57.4 vs. 76.6â€‰mL/min/1.73â€‰m2 ), and greater diuretic use. Higher SUA was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratios) Q5 vs. Q1â€‰=â€‰1.28 [95% confidence intervals (1.09-1.50), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003], cardiovascular death [1.44 (1.11-1.77), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001], HF hospitalization [1.37 (1.11-1.70), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004], and all-cause mortality [1.36 (1.13-1.64), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001]. Compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan reduced SUA by 0.24 (0.17-0.32) mg/dL over 12â€‰months (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Sacubitril/valsartan improved outcomes, irrespective of SUA concentration.

We studied interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and related cytokines/chemokines in HIV-infected patients with acute HCV receiving sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF+RBV) as part of the A5327 clinical trial. ISG expression was determined from PBMCs and circulating cytokines/chemokines were quantified from serum from study participants. The overall sustained virologic response (SVR) was 57%; all treatment failures were due to virologic relapse. Apart from NOS2a, baseline ISG/chemokine/cytokine levels were similar irrespective of treatment outcome. Downregulation of ISGs was observed at treatment week 4 and end-of-treatment (EOT), implicating HCV in establishing elevated ISGs early during HCV infection. Levels of many of these ISGs increased at post-treatment week 12 (PTW12) in relapsers only, coinciding with recurrent HCV RNA. Eleven ISGs were differentially expressed in responders vs relapsers. On-treatment viral suppression was also associated with a reduction in IP-10, CXCL11 and MIP-1Î² levels. In contrast, circulating IFN-Î± levels were significantly higher at EOT and PTW12 in responders vs relapsers.

Drug induced liver injury (DILI) is largely underreported, leading to underestimation of its burden. Electronic detection of DILI in healthcare databases shows promise to overcome the issues of spontaneous reporting. The performance of detection algorithms may vary due to inconsistent DILI definition and detection criteria. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the DILI detection criteria used in health record databases and determine the performance characteristics of the detection algorithms.


METHODS
We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus for studies that utilised laboratory threshold criteria to identify DILI cases. Validation studies were included in the meta-analysis. Data was abstracted using standardised forms and quality was assessed using modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria. We evaluate the performance characteristics of the detection algorithm by obtaining the pooled estimate of the positive predictive value (PPV) assuming a random effects model.


RESULTS
A total of 29 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; 25 of these studies (n=35948) had PPV estimates for performing the meta-analysis. The PPV of DILI detection algorithms was low, ranging from 1.0 to 40.2%, with a pooled estimate of 14.6% (95% CI 10.7-18.9). Algorithms that performed better had pre-specified exclusion diagnoses as well as drugs of interest to minimise false positives.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses' perspectives of language barriers and their impact on the provision of care to patients with limited English proficiency from diverse linguistic background.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Using individual interviews and focus group discussions, data were collected from 59 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals in England. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.


FINDINGS
Three themes: 'multi-ethnicities and language barriers'; 'the impact of language barriers'; and 'communicating via interpreters', were identified. Communication was identified as the most important aspect of care provision and an essential component of a nurse's professional role regardless of the clinical area or speciality. Language barriers were identified as the biggest obstacles in providing adequate, appropriate, effective and timely care to patients with limited English proficiency. Use of professional interpreters was considered useful; however, the limitations associated with use of interpretation service, including arrangement difficulties, availability and accessibility of interpreters, convenience, confidentiality and privacy related issues and impact on the patient's comfort were mentioned.


CONCLUSION
Language barriers, in any country or setting, can negatively affect nurses' ability to communicate effectively with their patients and thereby have a negative impact on the provision of appropriate, timely, safe and effective care to meet patient's needs.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
An understanding of language barriers can help nurses find appropriate strategies to overcome such barriers and, consequently, enhance the provision of effective care to patients affected by language barriers in any clinical setting in any health care system.

Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular tumor in childhood with a good prognosis in terms of mortality, but detailed information about tumor morphology and disease extent in retinoblastoma is important for treatment decision making.


PURPOSE
To demonstrate ultrahigh-field MRI tumor morphology and tumor extent in retinoblastoma correlating with in and ex vivo images with histopathology.


STUDY TYPE
Prospective case series.


POPULATION
Six retinoblastoma patients (median age 5.5 months, range 2-14) were prospectively included in this study. Median time between diagnosis and enucleation was 8 days (range 7-19).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
In vivo pre-enucleation at 1.5T MRI with a circular surface coil. Ex vivo imaging (FLASH T1 -weighted and RARE T2 -weighted) was performed at field strengths of 9.4T and 17.6T.


ASSESSMENT
After ex vivo imaging, the eyes were histopathologically analyzed and morphologically matched with MRI findings by three authors (two with respectively 14 and 4 years of experience in ocular MRI and one with 16 years of experience in ophthalmopathology).


RESULTS
Small submillimeter morphological aspects of intraocular retinoblastoma were successfully depicted with higher-resolution MRI and matched with histopathology images. With ex vivo MRI a small subretinal tumor seed (300 Î¼m) adjacent to the choroid was morphologically matched with histopathology. Also, a characteristic geographical pattern of vital tumor tissue (400 Î¼m) surrounding a central vessel interspersed with necrotic areas correlated with histopathology images.

The nature of the intermediates involved in the hydrogenation of CO was unraveled by poisoning alumina-supported cobalt catalysts with various concentrations of tin. The rate of formation of the main reaction products (i.e. methane and propylene) was found to be proportional to the concentration of multi-bonded CO, likely located in hollow sites. More, the specific rate of decomposition of these species was sufficient to account for the formation of the main products. These hollow-CO are proposed to be main reaction intermediates in the hydrogenation of CO under the reaction conditions used here, while linear CO are mostly spectators.",Germany,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),29193570,2017,CO hydrogenation on cobalt-based catalysts: tin poisoning unravels hollow-CO as a main surface intermediate.,n

Conflicting evidence exists regarding the potential risk of pancreatic cancer with use of incretin drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including six recently published large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), to evaluate the risk of pancreatic cancer with incretin-based therapies in patients with T2DM.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register and ClininalTrials.gov databases were searched for RCTs in T2DM that compared incretin drugs with placebo or other antidiabetic drugs, with treatment and follow-up durations of no less than 52 weeks, from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017. Two reviewers screened the studies, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias independently and in duplicate.


RESULTS
Thirty-three studies (n=79,971), including the six CVOTs, with 87 pancreatic cancer events were identified. Overall, the pancreatic cancer risk was not increased in patients administered with incretin drugs compared to controls (Peto OR 0.67 [95%CI 0.44 to 1.02]). In the six CVOTs, 79 pancreatic cancer events were identified in 55,248 subjects. Pooled estimates of the six CVOTs displayed the identical tendency (Peto OR 0.65 [95%CI 0.42 to 1.01]). Notably, in the subgroup of patients who received treatment and follow-up for 104 weeks or more, 84 pancreatic cancer events were identified in 59,919 subjects, and a lower risk of pancreatic cancer was associated with incretin-based therapies (Peto OR 0.62 [95%CI 0.41 to 0.95]).


CONCLUSIONS
Treatment with incretin drugs is not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with T2DM. Instead, it might protect against the pancreatic malignancy in patients treated for 104 weeks or more. The major limitations of this study are that pancreatic safety was not the primary outcome of these enrolled trials, and the event number and follow-up time are limited.",England,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",29193572,2017,Incretin-based therapies and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,n
1176,"Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) decline during nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in chronic hepatitis B with lower pretherapy alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is usually small and slow. This study aimed to investigate why ~10% of such patients showed ""rapid HBsAg decline"" â‰¥0.5 log10 IU/mL by month 6 of therapy. Patients with persistent pretherapy ALT <5X upper limit of normal (ULN) who had quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg) at baseline, month 6 and 12 of entecavir or tenofovir therapy were studied. ""On-treatment ALT elevation"" was defined as >10% increase above baseline to >2X ULN during first 6 months of therapy. Of the 256 patients treated, 51 experienced transient ""on-treatment ALT elevation"" [Group A], including 30 (11.7%) with ALT elevation to 2-5X ULN [group A-1] and 21 (8.2%) flared to >5X ULN [group A-2]. The magnitude of qHBsAg decline and rate of ""rapid HBsAg decline"" by month 6 was significantly greater and more frequent in group A (-0.446 vs -0.042 log10 IU/mL; 45.1 vs 8.8%, respectively, P=0.000) than in the remaining 205 patients without on-treatment ALT elevation (group B), being greatest in patients with hepatitis flare (group A-2: -0.559 log10 IU/mL and 57.1%, respectively). In patients with therapy â‰¥2 years, patients with ""on-treatment ALT elevation"" also showed significantly greater annual HBsAg decline, more frequent to <100 IU/mL and 4 times higher HBsAg seroclearance rate.

Previous study of norcantharidin (NCTD), isolated from blister beetles, has proved its anticancer effect on various tumors. However, the effect of NCTD in NPC has never been studied. The purpose of this study is to inspect the suppression activity of NCTD on NPC, along with the underlying mechanism. NPC cell line NPC-BM was treated with NCTD. NCTD remarkably inhibited proliferation and induce apoptosis in NPC-BM cell. Activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 was observed through western blotting. The expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL was significantly reduced, but expression of proapoptotic protein Bak was increased after treatment of NCTD. The cytotoxic effect of NCTD on NPC-BM cell is mainly due to apoptosis, mediated by caspase and mitochondrial pathway. These results suggested that NCTD could be a potential anticancer agent for NPC.",United States,Environmental toxicology,29193574,2017,Norcantharidin induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma through caspase and mitochondrial pathway.,n

Chronic alcohol consumption and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) afflicts individuals with substantial morbidity and mortality with limited treatment options available. Hepatic inflammation, triggered by activated Kupffer cells, is a driving force in alcoholic liver disease. Interleukin 37 (IL-37) exerts anti-inflammatory effects in hepatic diseases, however the impact of Interleukin 37 on alcoholic liver disease is unknown. In this study, we addressed the role of Interleukin 37 in alcoholic liver disease.


METHODS
We utilized Interleukin 37 expressing transgenic mice and human recombinant Interleukin 37 in models of alcoholic liver disease. Interleukin 37 expression was measured in liver samples of 20 alcoholic steatohepatitis and 36 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Patients.


RESULTS
Interleukin 37 transgenic mice are not protected against hepatic injury and inflammation in alcoholic liver disease. Ethanol suppressed Interleukin 37 expression in transgenic mice. Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) patients similarly exhibited reduced Interleukin 37 expression when compared to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Human recombinant Interleukin 37 ameliorated hepatic inflammation in a binge drinking model of alcoholic liver disease.

The SERVE-HF trial investigated the impact of treating central sleep apnoea (CSA) with adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) in patients with systolic heart failure. A preplanned substudy was conducted to provide insight into mechanistic changes underlying the observed effects of ASV, including assessment of changes in left ventricular function, ventricular remodelling, and cardiac, renal and inflammatory biomarkers.


METHODS AND RESULTS
In a subset of the 1325 randomised patients, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) and biomarker analysis were performed at baseline, and 3 and 12â€‰months. In secondary analyses, data for patients with baseline and 12-month values were evaluated; 312 patients participated in the substudy. The primary endpoint, change in echocardiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to 12â€‰months, did not differ significantly between the ASV and the control groups. There were also no significant between-group differences for changes in left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, diastolic function or right ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction (echocardiography), and on cMRI (in small patient numbers). Plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide concentration decreased in both groups, and values were similar at 12â€‰months. There were no significant between-group differences in changes in cardiac, renal and systemic inflammation biomarkers.


CONCLUSION
In patients with systolic heart failure and CSA, addition of ASV to guideline-based medical management had no statistically significant effect on cardiac structure and function, or on cardiac biomarkers, renal function and systemic inflammation over 12â€‰months. The increased cardiovascular mortality reported in SERVE-HF may not be related to adverse remodelling or worsening heart failure.",England,European journal of heart failure,29193576,2017,Adaptive servo-ventilation for central sleep apnoea in systolic heart failure: results of the major substudy of SERVE-HF.,n

Preventing unintended pregnancy and HIV transmission is important for women with HIV, but little is known about their contraceptive use, particularly under current antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommendations for treatment and prevention.


METHODS
The prevalence of contraceptive use and of dual protection was examined among 453 sexually active women with HIV aged 16-49 and enrolled in the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study in 2013-2015; multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of use. Two definitions of dual protection were assessed: the World Health Organization (WHO) definition (consistent condom use alongside another effective method) and an expanded definition (consistent condom use or a suppressed HIV viral load alongside an effective method).


RESULTS
Overall, 73% of women used effective contraceptives, primarily male condoms (45%) or tubal ligation (19%). Eighteen percent practiced WHO-defined dual protection, and 40% practiced dual protection according to the expanded definition. Characteristics positively associated with contraceptive use were younger age, having been pregnant, being heterosexual, being unaware of ART's HIV prevention benefits and having had partners of unknown HIV status (odds ratios, 1.1-6.7). Younger age and perceived inability to become pregnant were positively associated with both definitions of dual protection (1.04-3.3); additionally, WHO-defined dual protection was associated with perceiving HIV care to be women-centered and having had partners of unknown HIV status (2.0-4.1), and dual protection under the expanded definition was related to having been pregnant (2.7).


CONCLUSIONS
Future research should explore how sustained ART and broader contraceptive options can support women's sexual and reproductive health care needs.",United States,Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health,29193584,2017,Contraceptive Choice and Use of Dual Protection Among Women Living with HIV in Canada: Priorities for Integrated Care.,n
1188,"The Î²-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which exists as two isoforms (Î²1 and Î²2) in humans, has a Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM) that interacts with glycogen. While the Î²1- and Î²2-CBMs are structurally similar, with strictly conserved ligand-contact residues, they show different carbohydrate affinities. Î²2-CBM shows the strongest affinity for both branched and unbranched oligosaccharides and we have recently shown that a Thr insertion in Î²2-CBM (Thr101) forms a pocket to accommodate branches. This insertion does not explain why Î²2-CBM binds all carbohydrate with stronger affinity. Here we show that residue 134 (Val for Î²2 and Thr for Î²1), which does not contact carbohydrate, appears to account for the affinity difference. Characterization by NMR, however, suggests that the mutant Î²2-Thr101Î”/Val134Thr differs from Î²1-CBM, and the mutant Î²1- Thr101ins/Thr134Val differs from Î²2-CBM. Furthermore, these mutants were less stable to chemical denaturation compared to wild type Î²-CBMs confounding the affinity analyses. To support the importance of Thr101 and Val134 we constructed the ancestral CBM. This CBM retained Thr101 and Val134 suggesting that the extant Î²1-CBM has a modest loss of function in carbohydrate binding. As the ancestor bound carbohydrate with equal affinity to Î²2-CBM we conclude that residue 134 does play an indirect role in carbohydrate binding.",Germany,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,29193585,2017,Unravelling the carbohydrate-binding preferences of the carbohydrate-binding modules of AMP-activated protein kinase.,n

1190,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but socially important neoplasm due to its association with asbestos exposure. While MM is difficult to diagnose at an early stage, there are no particularly effective treatments available at the advanced stage, thus necessitating efficient strategies to prevent MM in individuals already exposed to asbestos. We previously showed that persistent oxidative damage caused by foreign body reaction and affinity of asbestos both to hemoglobin and histones is one of the major pathogeneses. Accordingly, as an effective strategy to prevent asbestos-induced MM, we undertook the use of an iron chelator, deferasirox, which decreased the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a crocidolite-induced rat MM model. However, this agent may exhibit adverse effects. Here, we studied the effects of iron removal by phlebotomy as a realistic measure on the same rat model. We injected a total of 5 mg of crocidolite intraperitoneally to F1 hybrid rats between the Fischer-344 and Brown-Norway strains at the age of 6 weeks. We repeated weekly or biweekly phlebotomy of 6 to 8 ml/kg/time from 10 to 60 weeks of age. The animals were observed until 120 weeks. In male rats, phlebotomy significantly decreased the weight and nuclear grade of MM, and modestly reduced the associated ascites and the fraction of more malignant sarcomatoid subtype. Weekly phlebotomy prolonged the long-term survival. Our results indicate that appropriate phlebotomy may be a practical preventive measure to attenuate the initiation and promotion capacity of asbestos towards MM by reducing iron in individuals exposed to asbestos.

Mentorship of junior faculty is an integral component of career development. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) Young Investigator (YI) Committee designed a mentorship program in 2004 whose purpose was to pair YIs (faculty â‰¤10 years of first academic appointment) with a senior mentor to assist with career development and involvement in COG research activities. This study reports on the committee's ability to achieve these goals.


PROCEDURE
An online survey was sent to YIs who were registered with the program from 2004 to2015, assessing three major domains: (1) overall experience with the mentor pairing, (2) satisfaction with the program, and (3) academic accomplishments of the mentees.


RESULTS
The response rate was 64% (110/171). Overall, YIs rated the success of their mentorship pairing as 7.2 out of 10 (median) (25th, 75th quartile 3.6, 9.6). The direct effects of the mentorship program included 70% YIs reporting a positive effect on their career, 40% reporting any grant or manuscript resulting from the pairing, 47% forming a new research collaboration, and 43% receiving appointment to a COG committee. Respondents reported success in COG with 38% authoring a manuscript on behalf of COG and 65% reporting a leadership position including seven current or past COG discipline chairs and 20 study chairs. Finally, 74% of respondents said they would consider serving as mentors in the program in the future.

To investigate the experiences of patients who received a Medical Emergency Team (MET) review following a period of clinical deterioration and their views about the potential use of a Patient and Family Activated Escalation System (PFAES).


BACKGROUND
Delay or failure by health professionals to respond to clinical deterioration remains a patient safety concern. Patients may sometimes identify subtle cues of early deterioration prior to changes in vital signs. In response to health professional and system failures, PFAESs have been mandated and implemented in Australia. However little research has evaluated their effectiveness nor taken patients' perspectives into account.


DESIGN
Qualitative exploratory descriptive design was used.


METHODS
Purposive sampling was used. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken in 2014 with 33 patients who required MET intervention. Data were collected from one private and one public hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The framework method was used to analyse the data.


RESULTS
All patients stated it was the clinician who detected and responded to deterioration. Private patient participants were unaware of the MET system, and felt escalating care was not their responsibility. These patients reported being too sick to communicate prior to and during MET review and did not favour a PFAES. Public patients were well informed about the MET system yet expressed concerns around overriding clinicians if activating a PFAES.


CONCLUSION
Patient participation during a period of deterioration is restricted by their clinical condition and limited medical knowledge. Patients felt comfortable to communicate concerns to clinicians but felt they would not activate the PFAES. This behoves clinicians to actively listen and respond to patient concerns.


RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE
Clinicians must promote a collaborative relationship and encourage patients to communicate their concerns. Given the perceived barriers to PFAESs utilisation, resources being employed for their implementation could be redistributed to other areas of patient safety. This article is protected by copyright.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the primary outcome of YAP signaling in the nucleus is achieved by interaction with the transcription factor TEAD1. The YAP/TEAD1 complex binds to DNA element and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth. However, constitutive knockout of TEAD1 leads to early embryonic lethality in mice. Thus, generation of a floxed TEAD1 mouse becomes crucial for further understanding mid- to late-gestation and post-natal role of TEAD1. Herein, we created and characterized a mouse model that allows for conditional disruption of TEAD1. Embryonic fibroblasts derived from the floxed TEAD1 mice enabled the Cre-mediated deletion of TEAD1 in vitro using virally delivered Cre recombinase. Furthermore, crossing the floxed TEAD1 mouse with a ubiquitously expressing Cre mouse resulted in efficient ablation of the floxed allele in vivo, and the animals recapitulated early embryonic lethality defects.

1207,"BACKGROUND
Arboviroses such as dengue, zika and chikungunya represent a serious issue in public health due to the absence of approved vaccine or specific antiviral drugs. One way to prevent these diseases is by combating the vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Diptera), which has serine proteases in the midgut. Protease inhibitors are molecules that can block enzyme activity impairing digestion and nutrition that can lead to death. Thus, we purified and characterized a novel chymotrypsin- trypsin inhibitor from Lonchocarpus sericeus (LsCTI) seeds and investigated its effect upon Ae. aegypti egg hatching, larval development and digestive proteases.


RESULTS
LsCTI showed a single protein band in SDS-PAGE, the molecular mass by MALDI-TOF-MS was 8,870.45 Da. Kinetics analyses revealed the noncompetitive type of inhibition and low Ki for chymotrypsin (8.24 x 10-8 M). The thermal resistance was remarkable, even at 100 Â°C for 180 min. The IC50 of LsCTI was 4.7 x10-7 M for Ae. aegypti midgut larvae enzymes.

1208,"The active ingredient in sunless tanning products (STPs) is a simple sugar, dihydroxyacetone (DHA). Several studies have demonstrated that DHA is absorbed within the viable layers of skin and not fully contained within the stratum corneum. Additionally, spray tanning and other aerosolized application methods have increased the risk of internal exposure through mucous membranes and inhalation. Beyond its presence in STPs, DHA also occurs as an endogenous by-product of fructose metabolism, and an excess of DHA in cells can induce advanced glycation end (AGE) products and oxidative stress. Therefore, exogenous and endogenous exposures to DHA may be harmful to cells, and it has already been demonstrated that exogenous exposure to DHA is cytotoxic in immortalized keratinocytes. Still, little is known about the exogenous DHA exposure effects on other skin components. In this study, we explore the effects of exogenous DHA exposure in a human melanoma cell line, A375P. Melanoma cells were sensitive to DHA and displayed a transient burst of reactive oxygen species within an hour of exposure. Cell cycle arrest at G2/M was observed within 24 h of exposure, and apoptosis, monitored by the cleavage of PARP-1 and Caspase-3, was detected within 72 h of exposure to DHA. Together, these demonstrate that exogenous exposure to DHA has cytotoxic effects in our selected cell model and indicates the need to further investigate the exogenous exposure effects of DHA in other relevant exposure models.",United States,Environmental toxicology,29193605,2017,Dihydroxyacetone induces G2/M arrest and apoptotic cell death in A375P melanoma cells.,n
1209,"BACKGROUND
A method of real-time, accurate probe tracking at the entrance of the MRI bore is developed, which, fused with pre-procedural MR images, will enable clinicians to perform cryoablation efficiently in a large workspace with image guidance.


METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) tracking coupled with optical tracking is used to track the probe. EM tracking is achieved with an MRI-safe EM sensor working under the scanner's magnetic field to compensate the line-of-sight issue of optical tracking. Unscented Kalman filter-based probe tracking is developed to smooth the EM sensor measurements when occlusion occurs and to improve the tracking accuracy by fusing the measurements of two sensors.


RESULTS
Experiments with a spine phantom show that the mean targeting errors using the EM sensor alone and using the proposed method are 2.21Â mm and 1.80Â mm, respectively.


CONCLUSION
The proposed method achieves more accurate probe tracking than using an EM sensor alone at the MRI scanner entrance.",England,The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,29193606,2017,Real-time probe tracking using EM-optical sensor for MRI-guided cryoablation.,y
1210,"Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with advanced melanoma, yet the somatic alterations that aid tumour cell dissemination and colonization are poorly understood. Here, we deploy comparative genomics to identify and validate clinically relevant drivers of melanoma metastasis. To do this we identified a set of 976 genes whose expression level was associated with a poor outcome in patients from two large melanoma cohorts. Next, we characterised the genomes and transcriptomes of mouse melanoma cell lines defined as weakly metastatic, and their highly metastatic derivatives. By comparing expression data between species, we identified Lunatic Fringe (LFNG), amongst 28 genes whose expression level is predictive of poor prognosis, and whose altered expression is associated with a pro-metastatic phenotype in mouse melanoma cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Lfng dramatically enhanced the capability of weakly metastatic melanoma cells to metastasize in vivo, a phenotype that could be rescued with the Lfng cDNA. Notably, genomic alterations disrupting LFNG are found exclusively in human metastatic melanomas sequenced as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using comparative genomics we show that LFNG expression plays a functional role in regulating melanoma metastasis.",United States,Molecular oncology,29193607,2017,Comparative genomics reveals that loss of lunatic fringe (LFNG) promotes melanoma metastasis.,n

1212,"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) which associate with angiogenesis due to local hypertension, chronic cerebral ischaemia and tissue hypoxia usually lead to haemorrhage, however, the therapeutic medicine for the disease is still lacking. 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) has been shown effective in the anti-angiogenic treatment. This study was conducted to examine whether and how 2-ME could improve the vascular malformations. Intracranial venous hypertension (VH) model produced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at the anoxia condition were used to induce inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro angiogenesis, respectively. Lentiviral vectors of ID-1 and p53 genes and of their siRNA were intracranially injected into rats and transfected into HUVECs to overexpress and down-regulate these molecules. 2-ME treatment not only reduced the inÂ vivo progression of brain tissue angiogenesis in the intracranial VH rats and the inÂ vitro increases in microvasculature formation, cellular migration and HIF-1Î± expression induced by anoxia in HUVECs but also reversed the up-regulation of ID-1 and down-regulation of p53 in both the inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro angiogenesis models. All of the anti-angiogenesis effects of 2-ME observed in VH rats and anoxic HUVECs were abrogated by ID-1 overexpression and p53 knockdown. Our data collectively suggest that 2-ME treatment inhibits hypoxia/anoxia-induced angiogenesis dependently on ID-1 down-regulation and p53 up-regulation, providing a potential alternative medical treatment for un-ruptured AVM patients.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193609,2017,Endogenous hormone 2-methoxyestradiol suppresses venous hypertension-induced angiogenesis through up- and down-regulating p53 and id-1.,n
1213,"OBJECTIVES
High body mass index (BMI) often predicts truncated breastfeeding, although why is unclear. We test a proposed mediating role of body concerns on breastfeeding initiation and child's age at weaning using longitudinal data for 55,522 mothers from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).


METHODS
A linear regression-based mediation analysis with bootstrapping estimates the indirect effects of BMI on breastfeeding decisions (ever-initiation of breastfeeding, child's age at weaning, and duration of any breastfeeding beyond six months) through the variables of concern around prepregnancy weight and weight gains due to pregnancy.


RESULTS
Contrary to prediction, Norwegian mothers with greater prepregnancy weight concerns had a higher likelihood of initiating breastfeeding. Concerns about weight gain during pregnancy, however, predicted earlier weaning. This relationship was the same for higher and lower BMI mothers.


CONCLUSION
In this very large sample, body image affects some breastfeeding decisions.

1214,"Overexposure to manganese (Mn) has been known to induce alpha-synuclein (Î±-Syn) oligomerization, which is degraded mainly depending on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and autophagy pathways. However, little data reported the cross-talk between ER stress and autophagy on Mn-induced Î±-Syn oligomerization. To explore the relationship between ER stress and autophagy, we used 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, the ER stress inhibitor), rapamycin (Rap, autophagy activator) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA, autophagy inhibitor) in mice model of manganism. After 4 weeks of treatment with Mn, both ER stress and autophagy were activated. Exposed to Mn also resulted in Î±-Syn oligomerization and neuronal cell damage in the brain tissue of mice, which could be relieved by 4-PBA pretreatment. Moreover, when the ER stress was inhibited, the activation of autophagy was also inhibited. Rap pretreatment significantly activated autophagy and decreased Î±-Syn oligomers. However, 3-MA pretreatment inhibited autophagy resulting in increase of Î±-Syn oligomers, and compensatorily activated PERK signaling pathway. Our results also demonstrated that the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA aggravated neuronal cell damage. The findings clearly demonstrated that the cross-talking between autophagy and ER stress might play an important role in the Î±-Syn oligomerization and neurotoxicity by Mn.",United States,Environmental toxicology,29193611,2017,Effect of the cross-talk between autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress on Mn-induced alpha-synuclein oligomerization.,n
1215,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) acts as a multifunctional protein that regulates intracellular signaling pathways during HBV infection. It has mainly been studied in terms of its interaction with cellular proteins. Here, we show that HBx induces membrane permeabilization independently of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex. We generated mitochondrial outer membrane-mimic liposomes to observe the direct effects of HBx on membranes. We found that HBx induced membrane permeabilization, and the region comprising the transmembrane domain and the mitochondrial targeting sequence was sufficient for this process. Membrane permeabilization was inhibited by non-selective channel blockers or by N-(n-nonyl)deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ), a viroporin inhibitor. Moreover, NN-DNJ inhibited HBx-induced mitochondrial depolarization in Huh-7 cells. Based on the results of the present study, we can postulate that the HBx protein itself is sufficient to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Our finding provides important information for a strategy of HBx targeting during HBV treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

Fourteen patients have been annotated in public databases but, to date, a clinical comparison has not been done and, consequently, a specific phenotype has not been delineated yet. We describe a patient showing neurodevelopmental disorders, dysmorphic features, and multiple congenital anomalies in which SNP array analysis revealed an interstitial 3.15 Mb de novo microdeletion in the 22q13.31 region encompassing 21 RefSeq genes and seven non-coding microRNAs. To perform an accurate phenotype characterization, clinical features observed in previously reported cases of 22q13.31 microdeletions were reviewed and compared to those observed in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a comparison between patients carrying overlapping 22q13.31 deletions has been done. This comparison allowed us to identify a distinct spectrum of clinical manifestations suggesting that patients with a de novo interstitial microdeletion involving 22q13.31 have an emerging syndrome characterized by developmental delay/intellectual disability, speech delay/language disorders, behavioral problems, hypotonia, urogenital, and hands/feet anomalies. The microdeletion identified in our patient is the smallest reported so far and, for this reason, useful to perform a detailed genotype-phenotype correlation. In particular, we propose the CELSR1, ATXN10, FBLN1, and UPK3A as candidate genes in the onset of the main clinical features of this contiguous gene syndrome. Thus, the patient reported here broadens our knowledge of the phenotypic consequences of 22q13.31 microdeletions facilitating genotype-phenotype correlations.

The results from previous studies that focused on the association between blood groups and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remain controversial. China has the world's largest burden of HBV infection. We assessed the distribution of ABO/Rh blood groups in Chinese adults and examined the association between these groups and HBV infection. We did a nationwide cross-sectional study using data from a physical check-up program from 31 provinces examined between 2010 and 2012. ELISA was used to test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serologic samples. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of the association between ABO and Rh blood groups and HBV infection. Among 3 827 125 participants, the proportion of participants with blood group A was highest (30.54%), followed by O (30.37%), B (29.42%) and AB (9.66%). A total of 38 907 (1.02%) were Rh-D negative. The prevalence of HBsAg in blood groups O, A, B, and AB were 6.34%, 5.55%, 5.18% and 5.06%, respectively. HBsAg prevalence was 5.65% in Rh-D positive and 3.96% in Rh-D negative participants. After controlling for other potential risk factors, multivariate models showed that participants with blood group O (adjusted OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.20-1.25) were at higher risk for HBV infection compared with group AB. Rh-D positive participants (adjusted OR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.37-1.52) were at higher risk of HBV infection than Rh-D negative participants. The associations between ABO/Rh blood groups and HBV infection were similar in subgroup analysis. The proportions of O, A, B and AB blood groups were approximately 3:3:3:1 and nearly one in 100 people was Rh-D negative among Chinese adults. Blood group O and Rh-D positivity were both associated with increased HBV infection. The risk of HBV infection and blood safety should be taken into consideration in clinical practice, especially when transfusing those with blood group O.

The high anisotropy of the 2D host materials makes them distort the degenerate orbitals of the Ln ions more efficiently than the symmetrical bulk host materials. Significant red shift of the PL peak for the Eu3+ was observed.

Given that some studies have mentioned that peritumoral adipocytes may contribute to breast carcinogenesis, present work sought to quantitative evaluate the morphometry of these cells in a group of adult women. Three thousand six hundred sixty four breast adipocytes, that came from biopsies of a group of adult females with different types of breast carcinomas (ductal, lobular, and mixed) and one with normal tissues, were evaluated through an image analysis (IA) process regarding six morphometric descriptors: area (A), perimeter (P), Feret diameter (FD ), aspect ratio (AR), roundness factor (RF), and fractal dimension of cellular contour (FDC ). Data showed that the adipocytes of the normal tissues group were bigger (A: 3398â€‰Â±â€‰2331 Âµm2 , P: 239â€‰Â±â€‰83 Âµm, and FD : 79.9â€‰Â±â€‰24.5 Âµm) than those from BrCa samples (A: 2860â€‰Â±â€‰1933 Âµm2 , P: 214â€‰Â±â€‰66 Âµm, and FD : 73.2â€‰Â±â€‰22.5 Âµm), and presented a more irregular contour (FDC of 1.370â€‰Â±â€‰0.037 for normal group and of 1.335â€‰Â±â€‰0.049 for the oncologic one).

1228,"PURPOSE
To describe sleep patterns in young children with epilepsy and to examine levels of agreement between measurements derived from actigraphy and diary recordings.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHODS
Eighty-nine toddlers and preschool-aged children with epilepsy wore an actigraph on their wrists for 7 consecutive days. Parents and caregivers maintained a concurrent sleep diary while the child was wearing the monitor. Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends.


FINDINGS
Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were Â±35, Â±15, Â±82, Â±70, and Â±29 min, respectively. Differences between actigraphy and diary-derived sleep variables were consistently greater for weekends than for weekdays. Discrepancies between actigraphy and diary-derived actual sleep at night were significantly greater for children who slept alone than for those who co-slept with a parent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates an acceptable agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings for sleep onset, sleep offset, and daytime sleep, but insufficient agreement for actual sleep at night and wake after sleep onset, with parents of children sleeping alone more likely to misestimate child sleep behaviors. Deviation of weekend sleep from weekdays further decreased the accuracy of parental sleep estimates and increased the discrepancies between actigraphy and diary.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on brain magnetic resonance imaging, represent an abnormality related to the development of geriatric syndromes. Recently, it has been found that low sympathetic nervous activity might be associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the severity of cerebral WMH and sympathetic nervous activity, measured by the heart rate variability.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 39 older patients. Holter recording was carried out for 30 min. From the RR intervals on the electrocardiogram, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals, the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in all the five segments of the entire recording, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF were calculated. In regard to the WMH, periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The WMH were also rated semiquantitatively according to the methods developed by Junque (periventricular hyperintensities) and de Groot (DWMH).


RESULTS
The LF/HF showed significant negative correlations with the total and regional periventricular hyperintensities, as well as DWMH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the negative associations remained significant between the LF/HF and DWMH (total, temporal, occipital). Furthermore, fall risk index significantly correlated with the LF/HF, total and the occipital DWMH.

1234,"BACKGROUND
In developed countries, ambulances normally carry oxygen cylinders but not compressed air. Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) with oxygen-driven nebulisers can result in hypercapnia and acidosis. Attempts to avoid this have involved interrupted administration of oxygen.1 However, small battery-powered air nebulisers are now available.


AIMS
This study aims to compare the prehospital oxygen saturations and treatment of patients suffering from AECOPD before and after the introduction of air nebulisers.


METHODS
The oxygen saturations and treatment of 200 AECOPD patients before and 200 AECOPD patients after the introduction of air nebulisers were compared. Compliance with a target saturation of 88-92% was calculated.


RESULTS
The median final oxygen saturation was lower for the post-intervention category (94%) than the pre-intervention category (96%). There was an increase in air nebuliser use from 0% to 56% (p < 0.001) and a decrease in oxygen use from 100% to 71.5% (p < 0.001). There was a numerical increase in the proportion of patients arriving at hospital with oxygen saturations of 88 - 92% following introduction of the air nebulisers (24% vs 16.5%) and a decrease in patients arriving with high saturations (67.5% vs 76.5%). The likelihood of achieving the target oxygen saturations following introduction of air nebulisers increased (odds ratio 1.598; 95% confidence interval 0.974, 2.621).

1235,"BACKGROUND
Lip repositioning is a conservative surgical technique used to treat excess gingival display. An array of modifications has been introduced to the technique over time and as studies show the technique and its modifications to be successful, there is little standardized information for clinicians to make informed decisions when choosing this technique for the treatment of patients with excessive gingival display (EGD).


OBJECTIVES
To review the current literature on the topic of lip repositioning for the treatment of excessive EGD, exploring outcome, and result longevity.


METHODS
A structured systematic search was carried out using the Ovid database and Web of Science to identify published studies on lip repositioning technique. Search was restricted to studies in the English language, describing a surgical intervention. Case reports were included as the number of published studies was limited.


RESULTS
The electronic search identified 93 articles, hand search identified 1 article, and reference search identified 1 article. After excluding duplicates and screening articles, a total of 22 articles met the inclusion criteria. An estimated mean improvement of 3.4Â mm (95% confidence interval, 3.0-3.8Â mm) was found possible with lip repositioning. Data analysis was performed using only 4 studies, amounting to a total of 33 patients. Potential risk of bias was identified in some of the studies included.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite the limited available studies on lip repositioning, an estimated mean improvement of 3.4Â mm was found to be possible with surgical lip repositioning, suggesting that the technique could be used successfully to treat EGD. However, more studies are necessary to properly evaluate the treatment approach and stability of the technique.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Recently, the demand for esthetics has significantly increased, driven by increased patient awareness and the search for an ideal smile. Creating the perfect smile is an intricate process that requires a multidisciplinary approach, with careful consideration of the lips and the gingival outline. Excess gingival display results in an unaesthetic smile, lip repositioning offers a comparatively simple solution for this problem. While the quality literature on this topic is limited statistical analysis of collected studies show that an estimated mean improvement of 3.4Â mm can be achieved with surgical lip repositioning.",England,Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ...

1236,"BACKGROUND
Little research exists in the teaching of evidence-based dentistry (EBD) to students in the fields of dental hygiene, dental nursing and orthodontic therapy. This study aims to analyse the effect of a 1-day EBD programme on knowledge and confidence whilst also gaining insight into students' experience of the intervention.


METHOD
A mixed methods study was utilised with explanatory sequential design. The population consisted of dental hygiene (DH), dental nursing (DN) and orthodontic therapy (OT) students (NÂ =Â 44). The intervention consisted of a 1-day active learning EBD programme, delivered via group projects and lectures. In the initial quantitative phase, a standardised questionnaire pre- and post -intervention measured changes in confidence for all participants, whilst change in knowledge was measured for DH and OT students only. Following this, focus groups were scheduled for all members of each discipline 3Â months post-intervention for DN and 2Â months post-intervention for DH and OT students. Semi-structured focus group schedules were drawn up, and groups organised according to the outcomes of quantitative data analysis. Qualitative results were analysed using a deductive adaptation of Burnard's thematic content analysis.


RESULTS
Forty-two students took part (94.45%) in this study. Median knowledge scores increased from zero to two of five (PÂ <Â .001), whilst median confidence score doubled from four to eight of eight (PÂ <Â .001). Results of thematic content analysis were coincident with quantitative results; however, it also provided constructive feedback regarding design and content of the course.


CONCLUSIONS
A 1-day bespoke programme in EBD increased students' confidence and knowledge in EBD skills. However, the findings further suggest that two successive half-day training sessions instead of one full-day training, tied in with coursework that requires the application of the acquired skills, may increase the learning experience further.",England,European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,29193633,2017,Evidence-based dentistry can effectively be taught to dental care professional students - A mixed methods study.,n

They present with short stature, cardiac and skeletal abnormalities and hearing loss. Variants of unknown significance in AMMECR1 in four male patients from two families with partially overlapping phenotypes were previously reported.

1239,"PURPOSE
Displacement is traumatic and often an unwanted social change that can lead to a loss of identity and socioeconomic, physical, and psychological livelihood. The purpose of the study was to describe the association of perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness to depressive symptom severity in Palestinian refugees, taking into consideration gender and poverty.


DESIGN
The descriptive, correlational study was framed within a socioecological lens. Data collection occurred between October 2015 and November 2015 in Amman, Jordan, which hosts the most Palestinian refugees in the world. The participants in the sample (N = 177) had a mean age of 36.9 years.


METHODS
Participants responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptom severity, the RAND-36 perceived health item, and a statement about hopefulness to return to Palestine. Descriptive, correlation, and logistic and linear regression analyses were computed.


FINDINGS
Results showed that 43% of participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 42% lived in poverty, and 20% had fair or poor health; yet, 60% were hopeful about returning to Palestine. Participants who had better perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness were less likely to have symptoms of major depression. Perceived health was the only factor-not gender, poverty, or right-of-return hopefulness-that explained the variance in depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Palestinian adult refugees in Jordan exhibited symptoms of major depression that were associated with poorer perceived health and less hopefulness about repatriation to Palestine.

Delayed detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with stroke. However, it is not well known whether delayed identification of AF in patients with stroke affects the prognosis of patients.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the timing of AF diagnosis after stroke and clinical outcomes.


METHODS
We identified a cohort of all patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of first-ever ischemic stroke, which was categorized into three groups, namely non-AF, AF presenting with stroke, and delayed AF diagnosis groups. The study patients were individually followed for 5 years to evaluate the occurrence of recurrent stroke and death.


RESULTS
In total, 17,399 patients were hospitalized with first-ever ischemic stroke, of whom 16,261 constituted the non-AF group, 907 the AF presenting with stroke group, and 231 the delayed AF diagnosis group. During the 5-year follow-up, 2,773 (17.1%), 175 (19.3%), and 68 (29.4%) patients in the non-AF, AF presenting with stroke, and delayed AF diagnosis groups, respectively, were hospitalized for recurrent stroke. The delayed AF diagnosis group exhibited a 1.57-times higher risk of recurrent stroke than the AF presenting with stroke group, after adjustment for the CHA2DS2-VASc scores (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-2.08; p = 0.002).

Many older adults face limitations to participating in active leisure activities as a result of their physical constraints from aging. Passive leisure activities become alternative leisure activities for older adults as a result of limited physical capacity. The present study sought to determine whether there exists a difference in the frequency of participation in passive and active leisure activities, and the effect of participation in passive and active leisure activities on the life satisfaction level of old adults.


METHODS
A total of 460 participants aged 60-95â€‰years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index - Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities.


RESULTS
The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), homemaking/maintenance (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and traveling (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index - Z for older adults.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates.

1247,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of needle holders in reducing staff hand exposure during biopsies guided by computed tomography fluoroscopy (CTF), through the analysis of data acquired during a detailed monitoring study, undertaken in parallel with an ongoing optimization process to reduce hand irradiation.


METHODS
Hand monitoring was performed with 11 extremity detectors, two per finger (base and tip) and one on the back of the wrist, for the left (dominant) hand, during two series of biopsies with comparable characteristics. The first series (47 biopsies) were performed with only quick-check method (QC) and occasional side-handle (SH) manipulation of the needle. The second series (63 biopsies) were performed after introducing needle holders (NH) in the course of an optimization process.


RESULTS
Choice of technique (QC, QC + NH, QC + SH) by the interventional radiologist (IR) was related to biopsy difficulty. Measured hand exposure was low (< 1 mSv) for all QC-only procedures, and for most of the QC + NH procedures. Occasional side-handle manipulation still occurred during challenging biopsies, so that 8% of biopsies in the second series accounted for ~70% of total fingertip dose (~90 mSv). The methodology used allowed a detailed insight into the dose reduction achievable with needle holders during real procedures, without the limitations of phantom measurements.

Needle holders proved effective in reducing mean hand exposure during clinical procedures where real-time manipulation was necessary. Occasional side-handle manipulation was found to contribute disproportionately to hand exposure.

1248,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays a central role in colorectal cancers (CRC). In particular, BRAF V600E-mutant tumors, which represent around 10% of CRCs, are refractory to current therapies. Over-expression and secretion of serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) is observed in around 50% of CRCs and its serum level can be used as a biomarker for poor prognosis. Utilizing a recently developed Extendable Blocking Probe assay, we analyzed the BRAF mutation status in a CRC patient cohort (N=571) using tissue-derived RNA as the starting material. From the same RNA samples we measured the relative SPINK1 expression levels using a quantitative real-time PCR method. Expression of mutant BRAF V600E correlated with poor prognosis, as did low expression of SPINK1 mRNA. Further, BRAF V600E correlated negatively with SPINK1 levels. In order to investigate the effect of MAPK pathway targeted therapies on SPINK1 secretion, we conducted in vitro studies using both wild-type and V600E colorectal cancer cell lines. BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, and subsequent MAPK pathway inhibitors trametinib and SCH772984,significantly increased SPINK1 secretion in V600E CRC cell lines Colo205 and HT-29 with concomitant decrease in trypsin-1 and -2 secretion. Notably no SPINK1 increase or trypsin-1 decrease was observed in BRAF wild-type CRC cell line Caco-2 in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors. In further mechanistic studies, we observed that only trametinib was able to diminish completely both MEK and ERK phosphorylation in the V600E CRC cells. Furthermore, the key regulator of integrated stress response, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), was downregulated both at mRNA and protein level in response to trametinib treatment. In conclusion, these data suggest that sustained inhibition of not only MAPK pathway activation, but also ATF-4 and trypsin, might be beneficial in therapy of BRAF V600E-mutant CRC and that SPINK1 levels may serve as an indicator of therapy response.",United States,Molecular oncology,29193645,2017,MAPK inhibitors induce serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) secretion in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma.,n

Diabetes mellitus in hospital inpatients is most commonly present as a co-morbidity rather than as the primary diagnosis. In some hospitals, the prevalence of co-morbid diabetes mellitus across all inpatients exceeds 30%, which could add to complexity of care and resource utilization. However, whether and to what extent co-morbid diabetes mellitus contributes indirectly to greater hospitalization costs is ill-defined.


AIM
This study determined the attributable effect of co-morbid diabetes mellitus on hospital resource utilisation in a General Internal Medical service in Melbourne, Australia.


METHODS
We extracted data from a database of all General Internal Medical discharge episodes from July 2012-June 2013. We fitted multivariable regression models to compare patients with diabetes mellitus to those without diabetes mellitus with respect to hospitalisation cost, length of stay, admissions per-year and inpatient mortality.


RESULTS
Of 4,657 patients 1,519 (33%) had diabetes mellitus, for whom average hospitalisation cost (AUD9,910) was higher than those without diabetes mellitus (AUD7,805). In multivariable analysis this corresponded to a 1.22-fold (95% CI: 1.12 - 1.33, p < 0.001) higher cost. Mean length of stay for those with diabetes was 8.2 days versus 6.8 days for those without diabetes, with an adjusted 1.19-fold greater odds (95% CI: 1.06 - 1.33; p = 0.001) of staying an additional day. Number of admissions and mortality were similar.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of anaphylaxis in pregnancy and describe the management and outcomes in the UK.


DESIGN
A population based descriptive study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System(UKOSS).


SETTING
All consultant-led maternity units in the UK.


POPULATION
All pregnant women who had anaphylaxis between 1st October 2012 and 30th September 2015. Anaphylaxis was defined as a severe, life-threatening generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction.


METHODS
Prospective case notification using UKOSS.


RESULTS
There were 37 confirmed cases of anaphylaxis in pregnancy, giving an estimated incidence of 1.6(95%CI:1.1-2.2) per 100,000 maternities. Four cases of anaphylaxis were in women with known penicillin allergies: two received co-amoxiclav and two cephalosporins. Twelve women had anaphylaxis following prophylactic use of antibiotics at the time of a caesarean delivery. Prophylactic use of antibiotics for Group B Streptococcal infection accounted for anaphylaxis in one woman Two women died(5%), 14(38%) women were admitted to intensive care and seven women(19%) had one or more additional severe maternal morbidities, which included three haemorrhagic events, two cardiac arrests, one thrombotic event and one pneumonia. No infants died; however, in those infants whose mother had anaphylaxis before delivery(n=18) there were 7(41%) neonatal intensive care unit admissions, 3 preterm births and one baby was cooled for neonatal encephalopathy.


CONCLUSIONS
Anaphylaxis is a rare severe complication of pregnancy and frequently the result of a reaction to antibiotic administration.

1253,"INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular medications are effective in prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD); however, medication non-adherence contributes to morbidity and mortality.


OBJECTIVE
This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarise the evidence regarding the relationship between characteristics of drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) and medication non-adherence in the CVD population.


METHODS
Systematic searches in PubMed, LILACS, Academic Search and CINAHL databases for observational studies that enrolled adults with CVD were performed, from January 1960 to December 2015. The meta-analysis tested the association between characteristics of pharmacotherapy and self-reported medication non-adherence outcome, using a random effects model. To investigate heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis.


RESULTS
Twenty-four cross-sectional studies and 7 cohort studies were included in this review. Based on 31 studies including 27Â 441 participants, we performed meta-analyses for all the characteristics of drug therapy that at least 2 studies evaluated, with a total of fourteen meta-analyses. The pooled results showed that studies which evaluate whether participants have insurance or another program that assists with medication costs, but not full coverage (ORÂ =Â 0.63; 95% CI: 0.53-0.74; PÂ <Â .001; I2 Â =Â 0%, PÂ =Â .938), and a dosing frequency of twice or more daily (ORÂ =Â 1.38; 95% CI: 1.13-1.69; PÂ <Â .001) were associated with non-adherence.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
The results of this review suggest that access to insurance or another program that assists with medication costs was a protection factor for non-adherence. On the other hand, a high frequency of dosing was a risk factor for non-adherence. Therefore, these characteristics of pharmacotherapy must be considered to improve medication adherence among CVD patients.",England,International journal of clinical practice,29193650,2017,Effect of characteristics of pharmacotherapy on non-adherence in chronic cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,n

1256,"This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of deep surgical site infection (DSSI) during hospitalisation after closed tibial plateau fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). We performed this retrospective study at a university-affiliated hospital with an advanced trauma centre. The data of adult patients with closed tibial plateau fractures treated with ORIF from January 2012 to February 2017 were extracted from the electronic medical records. Demographics, injury-related and surgery-related variables of DSSI and non-DSSI groups were compared by univariate test. Multivariate logistic analysis models were used to investigate the independent risk factors. In total, 676 patients with complete data met the inclusion criteria and were included, and of them, 17 developed DSSI (2.51%) during hospitalisation. Approximately 60% (9/17) of DSSI was caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to the non-DSSI group, DSSI patients had a significantly longer stay in hospital (25.8 vs 15.2â€‰days). Independent risk factors of DSSI identified by multivariate analysis were higher BMI (>26.0) (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.27; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.032), prolonged surgical duration (>138â€‰min) (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.54 to 11.19; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) and current smoking (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.47 to 8.62; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). A relatively low incidence rate of DSSI (2.51%) was found in this study, and several significant risk factors were identified. Smoking cessation programmes should be implemented immediately after hospitalisation, especially for obesity and morbid obesity patients. Detailed and comprehensive preoperative assessment and a considerate operative plan should be guaranteed to reduce surgical duration.",England,International wound journal,29193653,2017,Incidence and risk factors for deep surgical site infection after open reduction and internal fixation of closed tibial plateau fractures in adults.,n
1257,"BACKGROUND
The use of interactive health technology (IHT) is a promising pathway to tackle self-management problems experienced by many chronically ill patients, including solid organ transplant (Tx) patients. Yet, to ensure that the IHT is accepted and used, a human-centered design process is needed, actively involving end users in all steps of the development process. A first critical, predevelopment step involves understanding end users' characteristics. This study therefore aims to (a) select an IHT platform to deliver a self-management support intervention most closely related to Tx patients' current use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), (b) understand Tx patients' overall willingness to use IHT for self-management support, and investigate associations with relevant technology acceptance variables, and (c) explore Tx patients' views on potential IHT features.


DESIGN AND METHODS
We performed a cross-sectional, descriptive study between October and December 2013, enrolling a convenience sample of adult heart, lung, liver, and kidney Tx patients from the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. Broad inclusion criteria were applied to ensure a representative patient sample. We used a 35-item newly designed interview questionnaire to measure Tx patients' use of ICTs, their overall willingness to use IHT, and their views on potential IHT features, as well as relevant technology acceptance variables derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and a literature review. Descriptive statistics were used as appropriate, and an ordinal logistic regression model was built to determine the association between Tx patients' overall willingness to use IHT, the selected technology acceptance variables, and patient characteristics.


FINDINGS
Out of 139 patients, 122 agreed to participate (32 heart, 30 lung, 30 liver, and 30 kidney Tx patients; participation rate: 88%). Most patients were male (57.4%), married or living together (68%), and had a mean age of 55.9 Â± 13.4 years. Only 27.9% of Tx patients possessed a smartphone, yet 72.1% owned at least one desktop or laptop PC with wireless Internet at home. On a 10-point numeric scale, asking patients whether they think IHT development is important to support them personally in their self-management, patients gave a median score of 7 (25th percentile 5 points; 75th percentile 10 points). Patients who were single or married or living together were more likely to give a higher rating than divorced or widowed patients; patients who completed only secondary education gave a higher rating than higher educated patients; and patients with prior ICT use gave a higher rating than patients without prior ICT use. Tx patients also had clear preferences regarding IHT features, such as automatic data transfer, as much as possible, visual aids (e.g., graphs) over text messages, and personally deciding when to access the IHT.


CONCLUSIONS
By investigating Tx patients' possession and use of ICTs, we learned that computers and the Internet, and not smartphones, are the most suitable IHT platforms to deliver self-management interventions for our Tx patients. Moreover, Tx patients generally are open to using IHT, yet patient acceptance variables and their preferences for certain IHT features should be taken into account in the next steps of IHT development. Designers intending to develop or use existing IHTs should never overlook this critical first step in a human-centered design.

We examined 1227 subjects: from 17 SZ and BD kindreds, we studied 153 patients (57 SZ, 13 schizoaffective, and 83 BD) and 180 NAARs, and 894 unrelated controls from the Eastern Quebec population.

1260,"This study investigates the microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility of magnesium (Mg)-based Mg1Zr2SrxDy (xâ€‰=â€‰0, 1, 1.63, 2.08 wt %) alloys for biodegradable implant applications. The corrosion behavior of the Mg-based alloys has been evaluated in simulated body fluid using an electrochemical technique and hydrogen evolution. The biocompatibility of the Mg-based alloys has been assessed using SaSO2 cells. Results indicate that the addition of Dy to Mg-Zr-Sr alloy showed a positive impact on the corrosion behavior and significantly decreased the degradation rates of the alloys. The degradation rate of Mg1Zr2Sr1.0Dy decreased from 17.61 to 12.50 mm year-1 of Mg1Zr2Sr2.08Dy based on the hydrogen evolution. The ultimate compressive strength decreased from 270.90 MPa for Mg1Zr2Sr1Dy to 236.71 MPa for Mg1Zr2Sr2.08Dy. An increase in the addition of Dy to the Mg-based alloys resulted in an increase in the volume fraction of the Mg2 Dy phase, which mitigated the galvanic effect between the Mg17 Sr2 phase and the Mg matrix, and led to an increase in the corrosion resistance of the base alloy. The biocompatibility of the Mg-based alloys was enhanced with decreasing corrosion rates. Mg1Zr2Sr2.08Dy exhibited the lowest corrosion rate and the highest biocompatibility compared with the other Mg-based alloys. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1261,"Tumor progression is the main cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, little is known about the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by DYRK2 in cancer progression, particularly with respect to cancer proliferation and invasion. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 14 (CDK14) is identified as a target of DYRK2 using a comprehensive expression profiling approach. We found that reduced DYRK2 expression increases CDK14 expression, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, in addition to tumorigenicity in vivo. CDK14 and DYRK2 expression inversely correlated in human breast cancer tissues. We further identified androgen receptor (AR) as a candidate of DYRK2-dependent transcription factors regulating CDK14. Taken together, our findings suggest a mechanism by which DYRK2 controls CDK14 expression to regulate tumor cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer. Targeting of this pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

1263,"OBJECTIVE
Preterm birth (PTB) is associated with excess maternal cardiovascular disease risk. We considered that women with PTB and placental evidence of maternal malperfusion would be particularly affected.


DESIGN
Pregnancy cohort study.


SETTING
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, US.


POPULATION
Women with PTB (n=115) and term births (n=210) evaluated 4-12 years after pregnancy.


METHODS
Cardiometabolic risk markers were compared in women with prior PTB vs. term births; preeclampsia and growth restriction cases were excluded. Placental evidence of maternal vascular malperfusion (vasculopathy, infarct, advanced villous maturation, perivillous fibrin, intervillous fibrin deposition), acute infection/inflammation (chorioamnionitis, funisitis, deciduitus), and villitis of unknown etiology (chronic inflammation) was used to classify PTBs.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), fasting lipids, blood pressure (BP) and inflammatory markers measured after delivery.


RESULTS
Women with PTB and malperfusion lesions had higher total cholesterol (+13.5 mg/dl) and systolic BP (+4.0 mmHg) at follow up compared to women with term births, accounting for age, race, pre-pregnancy BMI, and smoking (p<0.05). Women with PTB and malperfusion accompanied by inflammatory lesions had the most atherogenic profile after pregnancy (cholesterol +18.7, Apolipoprotein B +12.7 mg/dl; all p<0.05), adjusted for pre-pregnancy features. Carotid IMT was higher in this group (+0.037 cm, p=0.031) accounting for pre-pregnancy factors; differences were attenuated after adjusting for BP and atherogenic lipids at follow up (+0.027, p=0.095).


CONCLUSION
PTBs with placental malperfusion were associated with an excess maternal cardiometabolic risk burden in the decade after pregnancy.

1264,"Abiotic stresses are a major cause of crop loss. Ascorbic acid (AsA) promotes stress tolerance by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulate when plants experience abiotic stress. Although the biosynthesis and metabolism of AsA are well established, the genes that regulate these pathways remain largely unexplored. Here, we report on a novel regulatory gene from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) named SlZF3 that encodes a Cys2/His2-type zinc-finger protein with an EAR repression domain. The expression of SlZF3 was rapidly induced by NaCl treatments. The overexpression of SlZF3 significantly increased the levels of AsA in tomato and Arabidopsis. Consequently, the AsA-mediated ROS scavenging capacity of the SlZF3-overexpressing plants was increased, which enhanced the salt tolerance of these plants. Protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that SlZF3 directly binds CSN5B, a key component of the COP9 signalosome. This interaction inhibited the binding of CSN5B to VTC1, a GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase that contributes to AsA biosynthesis. We found that the EAR domain promoted the stability of SlZF3 but was not required for the interaction between SlZF3 and CSN5B. Our findings indicate that SlZF3 simultaneously promotes the accumulation of AsA and enhances plant salt-stress tolerance. This article is protected by copyright.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on wound healing and metabolic status in subjects with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU).


METHODS
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 60 subjects (aged 40-85 years old) with grade 3 DFU. Individuals were randomly divided into two groups (30 subjects each group) to receive either probiotic or placebo daily for 12 weeks.


RESULTS
After the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, probiotic supplementation led to significant reductions in ulcer length (-1.3Â±0.9 vs. -0.8Â±0.7 cm, P=0.01), width (-1.1Â±0.7 vs. -0.7Â±0.7 cm, P=0.02) and depth (-0.5Â±0.3 vs. -0.3Â±0.3 cm, P=0.02). Furthermore, significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose (-29.6Â±30.3 vs. -5.8Â±39.8 mg/dL, P=0.01), serum insulin concentrations (-4.3Â±7.9 vs. +0.4Â±8.5 Î¼IU/mL, P=0.03) and HbA1c (-0.6Â±0.5 vs. -0.2Â±0.4%, P=0.003), and a significant rise in the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.01Â±0.01 vs. -0.01Â±0.02, P=0.003) were seen following supplementation of probiotic compared with the placebo. Additionally, compared with the placebo, probiotic supplementation resulted in significant decreases in serum total cholesterol (-4.8Â±16.1 vs. +7.0Â±27.1 mg/dL, P=0.04), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-9.0Â±14.7 vs. -1.7Â±8.6 mg/L, P=0.02), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) (-0.8Â±0.8 vs. -0.2Â±0.8 Î¼mol/L, P=0.001), and significant increases in plasma nitric oxide (NO) (+6.2Â±8.2 vs. +0.8Â±8.0 Î¼mol/L, P=0.01) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations (+179.3Â±97.2 vs. -85.1Â±203.4 mmol/L, P<0.001).

1266,"The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by degeneration of the corticospinal and spinocerebellar tracts leading to progressive spasticity. One subtype, spastic paraplegia type 47 (SPG47 or HSP-AP4B1), is due to bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in the AP4B1 gene. AP4B1 is a subunit of the adapter protein complex 4 (AP-4), a heterotetrameric protein complex that regulates the transport of membrane proteins. Since 2011, 11 individuals from six families with AP4B1 mutations have been reported, nine of whom had homozygous mutations and were from consanguineous families. Here we report eight patients with AP4B1-associated SPG47, the majority born to non-consanguineous parents and carrying compound heterozygous mutations. Core clinical features in this cohort and previously published patients include neonatal hypotonia that progresses to spasticity, early onset developmental delay with prominent motor delay and severely impaired or absent speech development, episodes of stereotypic laughter, seizures including frequent febrile seizures, thinning of the corpus callosum, and delayed myelination/white matter loss.

1267,"Owing to the presence of 80% soluble dietary fiber, high protein content and high value gum, clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) has recently emerged as an economically important legume. The developing clusterbean seeds accumulate 90% galactomannans in the endosperm, and therefore, can be used as a model crop to understand galactomannan biosynthesis and its regulation. miRNAs are tiny master regulators of their corresponding target genes, resulting in variations in the amounts of their metabolic end products. To understand the role of these regulators in galactomannan biosynthetic regulation, small RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced from five tissues of clusterbean genotype RGC-936, and miRanalyzer and DSAP programs were used to identify conserved miRNAs and novel small RNAs. A total of 187 known and 171 novel miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed, out of which 10 miRNAs were validated in vivo. A complicated network topology and 35% sharing of the target mRNAs between known and novel miRNAs suggest random evolution of novel miRNAs. The gene ontology (GO) annotation of potential target genes revealed the genes coding for signaling and carbohydrate metabolism (50.10%), kinases and other enzymes (20.75%), transcription factors (10.20%), transporters (8.35%) and other targets (10.6%). Two novel unigenes were annotated as ManS(Mannosyltransferase/Mannan synthase) and UGE (UDP- D-Glucose 4-epimerase) and validated as targets for three novel miRNAsi.e.,Ct-miR3130, Ct-miR3135, andCt-miR3157.

1268,"Storage roots of cassava, a major subsistence crop of sub-Saharan Africa, are calorie-rich but deficient in essential micronutrients, including provitamin A Î²-carotene. In this study, Î²-carotene concentrations in cassava storage roots were enhanced by co-expression of transgenes for deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and bacterial phytoene synthase (crtB), mediated by the patatin type-1 promoter. Storage roots harvested from field-grown plants accumulated carotenoids to â‰¤50 Î¼g/g DW, 15- to 20-fold increases relative to roots from non-transgenic plants. Approximately 85-90% of these carotenoids accumulated as all-trans-Î²-carotene, the most nutritionally efficacious carotenoid. Î²-Carotene-accumulating storage roots displayed delayed onset of post-harvest physiological deterioration, a major constraint limiting utilization of cassava products. Large metabolite changes were detected in Î²-carotene enhanced storage roots. Most significantly, an inverse correlation was observed between Î²-carotene and dry matter content, with reductions of 50% to 60% of dry matter content in the highest carotenoid accumulating storage roots of different cultivars. Further analysis confirmed concomitant reduction in starch content, and increased levels of total fatty acids, triacylglycerols, soluble sugars, and abscisic acid. Potato engineered to co-express DXS and crtB displayed a similar correlation between Î²-carotene accumulation, reduced dry matter and starch content, and elevated oil and soluble sugars in tubers. Transcriptome analyses revealed reduced expression of genes involved in starch biosynthesis including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes in transgenic, carotene-accumulating cassava roots relative to non-transgenic roots.

We assessed the frequency of short-term oral corticosteroid use in adults with diabetes, and examined the incidence of fractures, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and hospitalization for sepsis after corticosteroid use. We also evaluated whether preventative medications mitigated adverse events.


METHODS
We conducted a longitudinal study of 1,548,945 adults (ages 18-64 years) who received healthcare coverage through a large national health insurer, years 2012-2014. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using conditional Poisson regression.


RESULTS
Short-term oral corticosteroids were used by 23.9% of adults with type 2 diabetes, 20.8% with type 1, and 20.9% without diabetes during the 3-year period (p<0.001). Baseline risks of fracture, VTE, and sepsis were greater for individuals with diabetes than those without (p<0.001). The combined effect of having diabetes and using corticosteroids was greater than the sum of the individual effects (synergy indices of 1.17, 1.23, 1.30 for fracture, VTE and sepsis, respectively). The IRR for venous thromboembolism was 3.62 (95% CI, 2.41-5.45) in the 5-30 days after corticosteroid use. Fractures increased in the 5-30 days after corticosteroid use (IRR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.52, 2.80), but concomitant use of ergocalciferol mitigated this risk (IRR=1.13; 95% CI: 0.12, 11.07). The risk of hospitalization for sepsis was elevated with corticosteroid use (IRR=3.79; 95% CI: 2.05, 7.01) but was mitigated by the concomitant use of statins.

Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis.


METHODS
PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors.


RESULTS
Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population).


CONCLUSION
The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis.

Since FDA approval of the Melody valve, transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has been offered to an expanding population. Limited data exist regarding the safety and feasibility of TPVR in smaller patients.


METHODS
All patients weighing <20 kg who underwent catheterization for percutaneous TPVR at four centers were reviewed.


RESULTS
Of the 51 patients reviewed, 43 (84%) had successful valve implantation and 8 (16%) were found not to be candidates due to access veins too small (nâ€‰=â€‰3), coronary artery/aortic root compression (nâ€‰=â€‰3), and RVOT too large (nâ€‰=â€‰2). The 43 patients who underwent successful percutaneous TPVR had a median age and weight of 5.8 years (3.3-10) and 17.7 kg (13.5-19.8), and most had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). TPVR was performed via femoral vein (FV) access in 24 patients and internal jugular vein (IJV) access in 19 patients. Median weight in patients with IJV implant was 1.1 kg lower than those who underwent transfemoral implant (17.0 vs. 18.1 kg, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). There were four adverse events: one iliac vein injury, one contained MPA tear, and two patients with post-procedure femoral vein bleeding. All patients were alive at recent follow-up, a median of 2.0 years (0.1-6.0) after TPVR. There was excellent valve function with mean Doppler gradients of 3-20 mm Hg, and trivial or mild pulmonary regurgitation in all but one patient. There were no RVOT reinterventions and no cases of endocarditis.

We aim to describe ophthalmic characteristics and systemic findings in a cohort of seven patients with cone-rod retinal dystrophy (CORD) caused by pathogenic variants in the ALMS1 gene.


METHODS
Seven patients with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome (ALMS) were included in the study. A comprehensive ophthalmological examination was performed, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), a semiautomated kinetic visual field exam, colour vision testing, full-field electroretinography testing according to International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standards, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, and slit lamp and dilated fundus examination. DNA samples were analysed using Sanger sequencing or exome sequencing.


RESULTS
In our cohort, the ocular phenotype presented with a wide variability in retinal function and disease severity. However, age of symptom onset (i.e. nystagmus and photophobia) was at 6-9Â months in all patients. These symptoms mostly mislead to the diagnosis of congenital achromatopsia (ACHM), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), isolated CORD or Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The systemic manifestations in our cohort were highly variable.


CONCLUSION
In summary, we can report that most of our ALMS patients primarily presented with nystagmus and severe photophobia since early childhood interestingly without night blindness in the absence of systemic symptoms. Only genetic testing analysing both nonsyndromic retinal disease (RD) genes and syndromic ciliopathy genes by comprehensive panel sequencing can result in the correct diagnosis, genetically and clinically, with important implication for the physical health of the individual.",England,Acta ophthalmologica,29193673,2017,Ophthalmic features of cone-rod dystrophy caused by pathogenic variants in the ALMS1 gene.,n

Maternal obesity programs metabolic dysfunction in offspring, increasing their susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disease in later life. Moreover, pregnancy and lactation are associated with many metabolic adaptations, yet it is unclear how diet-induced maternal obesity may interrupt these processes.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We performed 1 H NMR serum metabolomics analysis on samples collected pre-pregnancy and in pregnant and lactating lean and high fat/sucrose (HFS) diet-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats to identify maternal metabolic pathways associated with developmental programming of offspring obesity. Gut microbial composition was assessed using qPCR. Offspring of HFS dams had nearly 40% higher adiposity at weaning compared to offspring of lean dams. While pregnancy and lactation were associated with distinct maternal metabolic changes common to both lean and obese dams, we identified several metabolic differences, potentially implicating dysregulated one-carbon and mammary gland metabolism in the metabolic programming of obesity. Gut microbial composition was significantly altered with obesity, and both gestation and lactation were accompanied by changes in gut microbiota.


CONCLUSION
Diet-induced maternal obesity and consumption of an obesogenic maternal diet results in differential metabolic and gut microbial adaptation to pregnancy and lactation; these maladaptations may be directly involved in maternal programming of offspring susceptibility to obesity.

This study takes a whole-transcriptome approach to assess gene expression changes in response to glyphosate treatment in glyphosate-resistant fleabane. We assessed gene expression changes in both susceptible and resistant lines so that the glyphosate death response could be quantified, and constitutively expressed candidate resistance genes identified. There are three copies of the glyphosate target site (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate; EPSPS) gene in Conyza and as Conyza bonariensis is allohexaploid there is a baseline 9 copies of the gene in any individual.


RESULTS
Many genes were differentially expressed in response to glyphosate treatment. Known resistance mutations are present in EPSPS2 but they are present in a glyphosate susceptible line as well as resistant lines and therefore not sufficient to confer resistance. EPSPS1 is expressed four times more than EPSPS2, further reducing the overall contribution of these mutations.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrate that glyphosate resistance in Conyza bonariensis is not the result of EPSPS mutations or overexpression, but due to a non-target-site mechanism. A large number of genes are affected by glyphosate treatment. We present a list of candidate non-target-site-resistance (NTSR) genes in fleabane for future studies into these mechanisms.",England,Pest management science,29193675,2017,Gene expression in response to glyphosate treatment in fleabane (Conyza bonariensis) - glyphosate death response and candidate resistance genes.,n
1279,"Patients with dry mouth often have an acidic oral environment lacking saliva to provide calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ions. There has been no report on tooth remineralization in acidic pH4 and CaP ion-lacking solutions. The objective of this study was to develop a novel method of combining poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) with adhesive containing nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) for dentin remineralization in pH4 and CaP-lacking solution for the first time. Demineralized dentin was tested in four groups: (1) dentin control, (2) dentin with PAMAM, (3) dentin with NACP adhesive, (4) dentin with PAMAMâ€‰+â€‰NACP adhesive. Dentin samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and hardness testing. Increasing the NACP filler level in adhesive from 0 to 40 wt% did not negatively affect the dentin bond strength (pâ€‰>â€‰0.1). NACP adhesive released CaP ions and neutralized the acid. PAMAM alone failed to achieve dentin remineralization in lactic acid. NACP alone induced slight dentin remineralization in lactic acid (pâ€‰>â€‰0.1). In contrast, the novel PAMAMâ€‰+â€‰NACP group in the pH4 and CaP-lacking solution completely remineralized the predemineralized dentin, increasing its hardness which approached that of healthy dentin (pâ€‰>â€‰0.1). In conclusion, dentin remineralization via PAMAMâ€‰+â€‰NACP adhesive in pH4 and CaP-lacking acid was achieved for the first time, when conventional remineralization methods such as PAMAM or NACP did not work. The novel PAMAMâ€‰+â€‰NACP method is promising to increase the longevity of the composite-tooth bond, inhibit caries, remineralize lesions and protect tooth structures, even for patients with dry mouth and an acidic oral environment.

Oxidative imbalance plays a key role in cancer induction and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to find out if gallic acid (GA) prevents oxidative stress in diabetic patients. Therefore, we investigated its impact on oxidation of DNA bases and on other health-related macromolecules.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We performed an intervention study (n = 19) with GA and monitored alterations of the DNA stability in single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays in lymphocytes. Furthermore, a panel of health-related biomarkers was measured before and after consumption of GA (15 mg/p/d) for 7 days. Significant reduction of oxidized purines (by 31%, p <0.001, effect size 0.404) and pyrimidines (by 2%, p <0.022, effect size 0.089) was observed in SCGE assays. Furthermore, the plasma concentrations of oxo-LDL and CRP were reduced after the intervention by 24% (p = 0.014, effect size 0.384) and 39% (p <0.001, effect size 0.686), respectively. No alterations of other biomarkers were found.

Dietary cholesterol has been shown to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed that oxysterol especially 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) may play a potential role in Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) production and accumulation during AD progression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To investigate the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol and 27-OHC on learning and memory impairment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with cholesterol diet with or without 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole) injection. We determined the levels of cholesterol, 27-OHC, 24S-OHC, 7Î±-OHC and 7Î²-OHC in plasma; ApoA, ApoB, HDL-C and LDL-C in plasma or brain; CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in liver and CYP46A1 and CYP7B1 in brain; cathepsin B, cathepsin D and acid phosphatase in lysosome; AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 in brain. Results showed increased levels of 27-OHC (PÂ <Â 0.01), LDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.01), ApoB (PÂ <Â 0.01) and decreased level of HDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.05) in plasma, upregulated CYP27A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) and CYP7A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) expression in liver, altered lysosomal function and increased level of AÎ² in brain (PÂ <Â 0.05).

Aedes aegypti is an important species of mosquito, which can transmit several arboviruses such as Dengue fever, Yellow fever, Chikungunya, and Zika. As these mosquitoes are becoming resistant to most chemical insecticides used in the world, studies with new larvicides should be prioritized. Based on the known biological profile of imidazolium salts (IS), the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of six IS as larvicides against Ae. aegypti, which was tested against Ae. aegypti larvae. The larvae mortality was measured after 24 and 48 h, and the residual larvicidal activity was also evaluated.


RESULTS
Promising results were obtained with aqueous solutions of the two IS 1-n-octadecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C18 MImCl) and 1-n-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate (C16 MImMeS), showing up to 90% mortality of larvae after exposition for 48 h. C18 MImCl was more effective than C16 mIMeS, causing mortality until the 15th day after larvae exposure. The application of C18 MImCl that was left to dry under ambient conditions for at least two months, and dissolved in water, showed a more pronounced residual effect (36 days with 95% mortality and 80% mortality up to 78 days).


CONCLUSION
This is the first study to show the great potential of IS for the control of Ae. aegypti.

METHODS AND RESULTS
This was a prospective cohort study including stable CAD patients who visited the Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas or the Texas Heart Hospital Baylor Plano, TX between 2010 and 2013. The outcome of all-cause mortality was ascertained from chart review and automated sources. The 449 patients included in this analysis had a mean age of 66.1â€‰Â±â€‰10.1 years. 67 (14.9%) patients died within 5 years; 56 (87.5%) of the 64 patients with known cause of death suffered a cardiovascular related mortality. Baseline ln(urinary 11dhTxB2 /creatinine) ranged between 5.8 and 11.1 (medianâ€‰=â€‰7.2) with the higher concentrations among those who died (median: 7.6) than those who survived (medianâ€‰=â€‰7.2, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Using baseline ln(11dhTxB2 ) to predict all-cause mortality, the area under the curve was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64-0.76).

1287,"Although antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza infection, it is an urgent requirement to develop new antiviral drugs regarding the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti-influenza compound, ZBMD-1, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell-based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD-1 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains inÂ vitro, with an IC50 ranging from 0.41-1.14Â Î¼M. Furthermore, ZBMD-1 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD-1 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD-1 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD-1 is a promising anti-influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193684,2017,Identification of a novel compound targeting the nuclear export of influenza A virus nucleoprotein.,n

Thus, several checkpoints are in place to tightly control platelet activation and adhesiveness in space and time.

The Yangtze river delta in eastern China, centered on Shanghai, is one of the most populated regions of the world with more than 100Â million residents. We examined the impact of influenza on excess mortality in Yancheng, a prefecture-level city with 8.2Â million population located 250Â km north of Shanghai, during 2011-2015.


METHODS
We obtained individual data on deaths by date, age, sex, and cause in Yancheng from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and used these to derive weekly rates of mortality from respiratory causes, respiratory and cardiovascular causes combined, and all causes. We used data on influenza-like illnesses and laboratory detections of influenza to construct a proxy measure of the weekly incidence of influenza virus infections in the community. We used regression models to estimate the association of influenza activity with mortality and excess mortality by age, cause, and influenza type/subtype.


RESULTS
We estimated that an annual average of 4.59 (95% confidence interval: 3.94, 7.41) excess respiratory deaths per 100Â 000 persons were associated with influenza, which was 4.6% of all respiratory deaths in the years studied. Almost all influenza-associated excess deaths occurred in persons â‰¥65Â years. Influenza A(H3N2) had the greatest impact on mortality and was associated with around 50% of the influenza-associated respiratory deaths in the 5Â years studied.

Perturbation of gut epithelial barrier function induces inflammation and other health problems that originate from the gut. Purple potato contains a high content of beneficial polyphenolic compounds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of purple potato extract (PPE) on intestinal differentiation and barrier function, and explore its underlying mechanism using Caco-2 cells and ex vivo cultured gut tissues.


METHODS AND RESULTS
PPE increased transepithelial electrical resistance and decreased FITC-dextran paracellular flux in Caco-2 cells, which were associated with strengthened intestinal epithelial differentiation in both Caco-2 cells and ex vivo guts. Furthermore, PPE treatment enhanced AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activity, concomitant with the increased expression of CDX2, a key transcriptional factor regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation. Knocking out AMPK using CRISPR/Cas9 system abolished the positive effects of PPE on intestinal epithelial differentiation and barrier function, in junction with the reduced expression of CDX2.


CONCLUSION
PPE improved gut epithelial differentiation and barrier function via activating AMPK, indicating that PPE, as well as associated purple potato consumption, could be used as a supportive dietary therapeutic strategy for improving gut epithelial health.

African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45 % of agro-pastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a compliment to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied.

To examine whether the presence of a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) influences mortality risk in elderly patients experiencing a first episode of heart failure (HF) hospitalization.


METHODS
A total of 677 consecutive patients aged â‰¥75 years admitted for a first episode of acute decompensated heart failure were evaluated according to the presence or not of DM, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates were evaluated.


RESULTS
A total of 240 patients (35.4%) had a diagnosis of DM. Overall, 42 patients (6.2%) died during admission; and 205 patients (30.3%) died after 1 year; however, no differences were observed in mortality rates between both groups. Cox univariate analysis did not identify prior DM diagnosis as a risk factor for 1-year mortality (HR 0.767, P < 0.082). Multivariate analysis identified older age (HR 1.101, P < 0.0001), lower preadmission Barthel Index (HR 0.987, P = 0.002), higher heart rate (HR 1.013, P = 0.02), higher admission serum potassium (HR 1.471, P = 0.016) and non-prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (HR 1.597, P = 0.018) as independent risk factors for 1-year mortality.

1299,"Non-dividing cancer cells are relatively resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and environmental stress factors. Promoting cell cycle re-entry of quiescent cancer cells is a potential strategy to enhance the cytotoxicity of agents that target cycling cells. It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanisms by which these cells are maintained in the quiescent state. The protein kinase DYRK1B is overexpressed in a subset of cancers and maintains cellular quiescence by counteracting G0 /G1 - S phase transition. Specifically, DYRK1B controls the S phase checkpoint by stabilizing the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 and inducing the degradation of cyclin D. DYRK1B also stabilizes the DREAM complex that represses cell cycle gene expression in G0 arrested cells. In addition, DYRK1B enhances cell survival by upregulating antioxidant gene expression and reducing intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Substantial evidence indicates that depletion or inhibition of DYRK1B drives cell cycle re-entry and enhances apoptosis of those quiescent cancer cells with high expression of DYRK1B. Furthermore, small molecule DYRK1B inhibitors sensitize cells to the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs that target proliferating cells. These encouraging findings justify continued efforts to investigate the use of DYRK1B inhibitors to disrupt the quiescent state and overturn chemoresistance of non-cycling cancer cells.

The study utilized a two-part questionnaire that captures respondents' characteristics and the validated tool on Leading a Culture of Quality for Infection Prevention (LCQ-IP). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized accordingly.


RESULTS
The prioritization of quality received the highest mean score among the four factors of the scale (mean = 3.89, SD = 0.65), followed by supportive work environment (mean = 3.88, SD = 0.68), psychological safety (mean = 3.85, SD = 0.65), and improvement orientation (mean = 3.84, SD = 0.64). Nationality, clinical experience, and attendance to seminars or training were identified as significant predictors.


CONCLUSIONS
The respondents perceived the infection prevention climate of the two general hospitals positively. This study strengthens the idea that organizational context influences negatively or positively the programs on infection prevention being implemented in the hospitals.

1306,"The inflammatory response and the activation of coagulation are two important responses in a host's defense against infection. These mechanisms do not work independently but cooperate in a complex and synchronous manner. Recent research has also shed light on the critical role of thrombus formation that prevents the dissemination of microbes. The cellular components of blood vessels, leukocytes, platelets, erythrocytes, and vascular endothelial cells play significant roles in the development of thrombi in combination with activation of the coagulation system. In addition to the cellular components, alarmins such as histones and high-mobility group box 1, microparticles, and secreted granule proteins are all important for clot formation. In this summary, we review the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced coagulopathy and the role of cellular components and critical factors released from damaged cells. In addition, we will review important therapeutic approaches developed, under investigation, and currently available in certain countries that include antithrombin, recombinant thrombomodulin, anti-Toll-like receptor 4 therapy, anti-damage associated molecular patterns therapy, and hemoadsorption using a polymyxin-B immobilized fiber column.

Although CPKs are recognized as key messengers in signal transduction, the specific roles of CPKs and the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the function of OsCPK24, a cytosol-localized calcium-dependent protein kinase in rice. OsCPK24 was universally and highly expressed in rice plants and was induced by cold treatment. While OsCPK24 knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to cold compared to wild type, OsCPK24-overexpressing plants exhibited increased cold tolerance. Plants overexpressing OsCPK24 exhibited increased accumulation of proline (an osmoprotectant) and glutathione (an antioxidant) and maintained a higher GSH/GSSG (reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione) ratio during cold stress compared to wild type. In addition to these effects in responses to cold stress, we found that the kinase activity of OsCPK24 varied under different calcium concentrations. Further, OsCPK24 phosphorylated OsGrx10, a glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, at rates modulated by changes in calcium concentration. Together, our results suggest that OsCPK24 functions as a positive regulator of cold stress tolerance in rice, a process mediated by calcium signaling and involving phosphorylation and the inhibition of OsGrx10 to sustain higher glutathione levels.",China (Republic : 1949- ),Journal of integrative plant biology,29193704,2017,The calcium-dependent kinase OsCPK24 functions in cold stress responses in rice.,n

1319,"Cardiovascular disease is the world's leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with high blood pressure (BP) contributing to increased severity and number of adverse outcomes. Plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4) has been previously shown to modulate systemic BP. However, published data are conflicting, with both overexpression and inhibition of PMCA4 inÂ vivo shown to increase arterial contractility. Hence, our objective was to determine the role of PMCA4 in the regulation of BP and to further understand how PMCA4 functionally regulates BP using a novel specific inhibitor to PMCA4, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Our approach assessed conscious BP and contractility of resistance arteries from PMCA4 global knockout (PMCA4KO) mice compared to wild-type animals. Global ablation of PMCA4 had no significant effect on BP, arterial structure or isolated arterial contractility. ATA treatment significantly reduced BP and arterial contractility in wild-type mice but had no significant effect in PMCA4KO mice. The effect of ATAinÂ vivo and exÂ vivo was abolished by the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor Vinyl-l-NIO. Thus, this highlights differences in the effects of PMCA4 ablation and acute inhibition on the vasculature.

1320,"BACKGROUND
during acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure (AHRF), arterial pH is associated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) failure and mortality. Venous blood gas (VBG) has been proposed as a substitute for arterial blood gas, based on a good agreement between venous and arterial values. We assessed the predictive value of admission VBG on intubation rate, NIV failure and mortality during AHRF.


METHODS
retrospective chart review of inpatients admitted between 2009 and 2015 with AHRF who had VBG performed on admission. Demographic, clinical and biological data were collected throughout the hospital course.


RESULTS
196 patients were included and hospital survival was not significantly associated with initial venous pH, PCO2 or HCO3- . Patients requiring intubation had significantly lower venous pH (7.29 (7.24-7.33) versus 7.31 (7.28-7.36), p=0.04) while venous PCO2 and HCO3- did not differ as compared to non-intubated patients. Intubation within 48 hours of admission was associated with significantly lower venous pH (7.28 (7.24-7.30) versus 7.32 (7.28-7.37), p=0.002) and higher PCO2 (72 (63-92) mmHg versus 62 (52-75) mmHg, p=0.04). Among 69 patients receiving NIV, there were no differences in venous pH (7.29 (7.25-7.31) versus 7.30 (7.27-7.35), p=0.3) or PCO2 (68 (44-74) mmHg versus 70 (55-97) mmHg, p=0.23) associated with subsequent intubation. Using c statistics, we observed poor performances of venous pH, PCO2 or HCO3- for prediction of NIV failure, intubation or hospital mortality.

With an aging Singapore population, there is an increasing demand for dementia care. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Primary Care Dementia Clinic (PCDC) in comparison with the Memory Clinic (MC; hospital-based) and other polyclinics.


METHODS
A quasi-experimental design was implemented. Effectiveness of PCDC was assessed through caregiver satisfaction, quality of life (caregiver-rated) and adverse events rates. Quality-of-Life measures using the EuroQol 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at baseline, 6â€‰months and 12â€‰months was assessed. Costs were calculated from a societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the PCDC was compared with MC and other polyclinics.


RESULTS
The present study showed that quality of life and the rate of adverse events at 12â€‰months were similar between the three groups. Caregiver satisfaction at 12â€‰months was higher in the PCDC group when compared with other polyclinics. There were no observed differences in societal cost between the three groups. At 6-month follow up, direct medical costs for PCDC were significantly lower that of other polyclinics. At 12-month follow up, PCDC patients had higher Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) compared with the MC group.


CONCLUSION
PCDC provided effective care, similar to care at MC and better than care at other polyclinics. Caregiver satisfaction was higher for the PCDC group, and PCDC patients had lower direct medical costs at 6-month follow up. Given these findings, adopting a PCDC model in other polyclinics in Singapore can be beneficial for optimal right siting of patients.

Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a target pest of the Vip3A protein used in pyramided Bt corn and cotton in the U.S. In this study, we provide the first documentation of a resistance allele conferring Vip3A resistance in a field-derived population of S. frugiperda from U.S., and characterize its inheritance and cross-resistance.


RESULTS
An F2 screen with 104 two-parent families generated from a field collection of S. frugiperda in Louisiana, U.S., resulted in one family carrying a Vip3A resistance allele. The Vip3A-resistant strain (RR) derived from the two-parent family showed a high level of resistance to Vip3A in both diet and whole plant bioassays, with a resistance ratio of >632.0-fold relative to a susceptible population (SS) based on diet-overlay bioassays. The inheritance of Vip3A resistance was monogenic, autosomal and recessive. Furthermore, the Vip3A resistance conferred no cross-resistance to Cry1F, Cry2Ab2 or Cry2Ae purified proteins, with resistance ratios of 3.5, 5.0 and 1.1, respectively.

However, the regulatory mechanisms of CSCs have not been clarified. This study aims to investigate the role of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) on EMT and CSC regulation in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). We found TRAF6 was overexpressed in human SCCHN tissues, and high TRAF6 expression was associated with lymphatic metastasis and resulted in poor prognosis in patients with SCCHN. In addition, elevated TRAF6 expression was observed in several HNSCC cell lines, and wound healing and transwell assay results showed that TRAF6 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion ability of the SCCHN cells. Moreover, the expression of Vimentin, Slug and N-cadherin was down-regulated and that of E-cadherin was elevated after TRAF6 knockdown but decreased by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1) and CAL27 similar to mesenchymal cells formed after TGF-Î²1 induction. In addition, the expression levels of CD44, ALDH1, KLF4 and SOX2 were inhibited after TRAF6 knockdown, and the anchor-dependent colony formation number and sphere number were remarkably reduced. Flow cytometry showed TRAF6 knockdown reduced ALDH1-positive cancer stem cells. We also demonstrated that TRAF6 is closely associated with EMT process and cancer stem cells using a Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice SCCHN model and human SCCHN tissue microarray. Our findings indicate that TRAF6 plays a role in EMT phenotypes, the generation and maintenance of CSCs in SCCHN, suggesting that TRAF6 is a potential therapeutic target for SCCHN.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193723,2017,TRAF6 regulates tumour metastasis through EMT and CSC phenotypes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,n
1328,"The opportunity to target weed seeds during grain harvest was established many decades ago following the introduction of mechanical harvesting and the recognition of high weed seed retention levels at crop maturity; however, this opportunity remained largely neglected until more recently.

With diminishing herbicide resources and the need to maintain highly productive reduced tillage and stubble retention practices, growers began to develop systems that targeted weed seed during crop harvest. Research and development efforts over the last two decades have established the efficacy of HWSC systems in Australian cropping systems, where widespread adoption is now occurring. With similarly dramatic herbicide resistance issues now present across many of the world's cropping regions, it is timely for HWSC systems to be considered for inclusion in weed management programs in these areas.

1332,"Î²-Catenin signalling plays an important role in regulating tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an indispensable programme for driving renal fibrosis. As an adapter protein, four and a half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) acts as a coregulator of Î²-catenin in several other cell types. To determine whether FHL2 affects Î²-catenin signalling and thus is involved in tubular EMT, we examined its expression and function in the process of TGF-Î²1-induced EMT. FHL2 mRNA and protein were induced by TGF-Î²1 in rat tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E), an effect that intracellular Smad signalling was required. Ectopic expression of FHL2 inhibited E-cadherin and enhanced Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) and fibronectin expression, whereas knockdown of FHL2 partially restored E-cadherin and reduced Î±-SMA and fibronectin induction stimulated by TGF-Î²1. Overexpression of FHL2 increased Î²-catenin dephosphorylation (Ser37/Thr41), nuclear translocation and Î²-catenin-mediated transcription and up-regulated expression of Î²-catenin target, EMT-related genes, such as Snail, Twist, vimentin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-7. Conversely, knockdown of FHL2 increased Î²-catenin phosphorylation (Ser33/37/Thr41), decreased its nuclear translocation and inhibited Î²-catenin-mediated transcription and target genes expression. TGF-Î²1 induced a FHL2/Î²-catenin interaction in NRK-52E cells, especially in the nuclei. In a mouse model of obstructive nephropathy, FHL2 mRNA and protein were induced in a time-dependent fashion, and the extent and pattern of renal Î²-catenin activation were positively correlated with FHL2 induction. Collectively, this study suggests that FHL2, via modulating Î²-catenin signalling, may implicate in regulation of TGF-Î²1-mediated tubular EMT and could be a potential therapeutic target for fibrotic kidney disease.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193729,2017,FHL2 promotes tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through modulating Î²-catenin signalling.,n

ADAMTS9, a member of the metalloprotease large family, has been identified as a candidate 3p14.2 TSG inactivated by aberrant promoter CpG methylation in several carcinomas, but little known about its expression and function in breast cancer. In this report, ADAMTS9 expression and methylation was analysed in breast cancer cell lines and tissue samples. ADAMTS9 RNA was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines (6/8). After treating the cells with demethylation agent Aza and TSA, ADAMTS9 expression was dramatically increased. Bisulphite genomic sequencing and methylation-specific PCR detected promoter methylation, which was associated with decreased ADAMTS9 expression. Hypermethylation was also detected in 130/219 (59.4%) of primary tumours but only in 4.5% (2/44) of paired surgical margin tissues. Ectopic expression of ADAMTS9 in tumor cells induced significant growth suppression, cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, enhanced apoptosis and reduced cell migration and invasion. Conditioned culture medium from ADAMTS9-transfected BT549 cells markedly disrupted tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) in Matrigel. Furthermore, ADAMTS9 inhibited AKT signaling and its downstream targets (MDM2, p53, p21, p27, E-cadherin, VIM, SNAIL, VEGFA, NFÎºB-p65 and MMP2). In addition, we demonstrated, for the first time, that ADAMTS9 inhibits AKT signaling, through suppressing its upstream activators EGFR and TGFÎ²1/TÎ²R(I/II) in breast cancer cells.

Strong induction of TaHDZipI-5 expression by low temperatures, and the elevated TaHDZipI-5 levels of expression in flowers and early developing grains in the absence of stress, suggest that TaHDZipI-5 is involved in the regulation of frost tolerance at flowering.

Strengthening neighborhood social networks is important for promoting health among older adults. However, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing older adults' social networks have not yet been established. The present study examined whether a university-led community intervention that provided communication opportunities could increase older Japanese adults' neighborhood social networks.


METHODS
The present study used a quasi-experimental design. Before the intervention, using postal mail, we carried out a baseline questionnaire survey that was sent to all people living in the Tsurukabuto community aged â‰¥60â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰1769), of whom 1068 responded. For the community intervention, 18 event-based programs were provided over the course of 1â€‰year at Kobe University. Academic staff at Kobe University organized all the programs. During the program, social interactions among participants were promoted. A follow-up survey was distributed to those who responded to the baseline survey, and 710 individuals answered the question about their participation in the intervention programs (138 respondents were participants, 572 were non-participants).

In addition, they are multipotent and are able to differentiate into various cell types with diverse functions.

ICC develop by way of mesenchymal cell differentiation in the outer parts of the primitive gut wall around the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia, with the exception of colon, where they appear simultaneously also at the submucosal border of the circular muscular layer around the submucosal plexus (SMP) ganglia. However, in a complex process of reciprocal induction of NCC and local mesenchyma, c-kit positive precursors are the first to differentiate, representing probably the common precursors of ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). C-kit positive precursors could represent a key impact factor regarding the final differentiation of NCC into neurons and glial cells with neurons subsequently excreting stem cell factor (SCF) and other signalling molecules.

Nevertheless, assessment of DOAC exposure and anticoagulant effects may become useful in various clinical scenarios. The four approved DOACs - apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban and rivaroxaban - have different characteristics impacting assay selection and the interpretation of results. This article provides an updated overview on 1) which test to use (and their advantages and limitations), 2) when to assay DOAC levels, 3) how to interpret the results relating to bleeding risk, emergency situations and perioperative management, and 4) what is the impact of DOACs on routine and specialised coagulation assays. Assays for anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity are the preferred methods when quantitative information is useful, although the situations when to test for DOAC levels are still debated. Different reagent sensitivities and variabilities in laboratory calibrations impact assay results. International calibration standards for all specific tests for each DOAC are needed to reduce the inter-laboratory variability and allow inter-study comparisons. The impact of the DOACs on haemostasis testing may cause false-positive or -negative results, however, these can be minimized by using specific assays and collecting blood samples at trough concentrations. Finally, prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of proposed laboratory thresholds in relation to clinical decisions. We offer recommendations on the tests to use for measuring DOACs and practical guidance on laboratory testing to help patient management and avoid diagnostic errors.

The study included the analysis of key mechanisms regulating lipid/cholesterol metabolism, and thermogenesis in brown (BAT) and epididymal white (eWAT) adipose tissues, abdominal muscle and liver of male rats.


RESULTS
CL316243 (1 mg kg-1 ) and liraglutide (100 Î¼g kg-1 ) co-administration over 6 days potentiated an overall negative energy balance (reduction in food intake, body weight gain, fat/non-fat mass ratio, liver fat content, and circulating levels of NEFAs, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol and leptin).

We also observed increased gene expression of uncoupling proteins regulating thermogenesis in BAT/eWAT (Ucp1) and muscle (Ucp2/3). Expression of transcription factor and enzymes involved either in de novo lipogenesis (Chrebp, Acaca, Fasn, Scd1, Insig1, Srebp1) or in fatty acid Î²-oxidation (Cpt1b) was enhanced in eWAT and/or muscle but decreased in BAT. PparÎ± and PparÎ³, essentials in lipid flux/storage, were decreased in BAT/eWAT but increased in the muscle and liver. Cholesterol synthesis regulators (Insig2, Srebp2, Hmgcr) were particularly over-expressed in muscle. These GLP-1R/Î²3-AR-induced metabolic effects were associated with the down-regulation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways (PKA/AKT/AMPK).


CONCLUSIONS
Combined activation of GLP-1 and Î²3-adrenergic receptors potentiate changes in peripheral pathways regulating lipid/cholesterol metabolism in a tissue-specific manner that favors a switch in energy availability/expenditure and may be useful for obesity treatment.

1342,"BACKGROUND
While the 'no-tillage' management system generally improves soil properties and helps to control arthropod pests, it may also intensify crop infestation by the common vole (Microtus arvalis Pallas). In this study, we evaluated the impact of soil management (no-tillage, tillage), crop and previous crop (winter wheat, winter rape), and season (spring, autumn) on common vole density using data from the Common Vole Monitoring Programme undertaken by the Plant Protection Service of the Czech Republic between 2000 and 2009.


RESULTS
Models predicted low mean values of vole infestation across management types, crops, and seasons. The untilled fields hosted significantly more voles than the tilled fields in spring but not in autumn. More common voles were found in winter rape than in winter wheat during both seasons.


CONCLUSION
Recent studies suggest that no-tillage management is more profitable than tillage management due to its positive impact on soil properties and pest control. During periods of high vole infestation, however, tillage may constitute an alternative strategy for reducing yield losses.",England,Pest management science,29193739,2017,Influence of no-tillage versus tillage system on common vole (Microtus arvalis) population density.,n
1343,"To ensure efficient propagation, viruses need to rapidly produce viral proteins after cell entrance. Since viral genomes do not encode any components of the protein biosynthesis machinery, viral proteins must be produced by the host cell. To hi-jack the host cellular translation, viruses use a great variety of distinct strategies. Many single-stranded positive-sensed RNA viruses contain so-called internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). IRESs are structural RNA motifs that have evolved to specific folds that recruit the host ribosomes on the viral coding sequences in order to synthesize viral proteins. In host canonical translation, recruitment of the translation machinery components is essentially guided by the 5' cap (m7 G) of mRNA. In contrast, IRESs are able to promote efficient ribosome assembly internally and in cap-independent manner. IRESs have been categorized into four classes, based on their length, nucleotide sequence, secondary and tertiary structures, as well as their mode of action. Classes I and II require the assistance of cellular auxiliary factors, the eukaryotic intiation factors (eIF), for efficient ribosome assembly. Class III IRESs require only a subset of eIFs whereas Class IV, which are the more compact, can promote translation without any eIFs. Extensive functional and structural investigations of IRESs over the past decades have allowed a better understanding of their mode of action for viral translation. Because viral translation has a pivotal role in the infectious program, IRESs are therefore attractive targets for therapeutic purposes.

1344,"OBJECTIVE
This study sought to understand how the dietary source of carbohydrates, either high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or complex carbohydrates, affects energy expenditure (EE) measures, appetitive sensations, and hormones during 24 hours of overfeeding.


METHODS
Seventeen healthy participants with normal glucose regulation had 24-hour EE measures and fasting blood and 24-hour urine collection during four different 1-day diets, including an energy-balanced diet, fasting, and two 75% carbohydrate diets (5% fat) given at 200% of energy requirements with either HFCS or whole-wheat foods as the carbohydrate source. In eight volunteers, hunger was assessed with visual analog scales the morning after the diets.


RESULTS
Compared with energy balance, 24-hour EE increased 12.8%â€‰Â±â€‰6.9% with carbohydrate overfeeding (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). No differences in 24-hour EE or macronutrient utilization were observed between the two high-carbohydrate diets; however, sleeping metabolic rate was higher after the HFCS diet (Î”â€‰=â€‰35â€‰Â±â€‰48 kcal [146â€‰Â±â€‰200 kJ]; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Insulin, ghrelin, and triglycerides increased the morning after both overfeeding diets. Urinary cortisol concentrations (82.8â€‰Â±â€‰35.9 vs. 107.6â€‰Â±â€‰46.9 nmol/24 h; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and morning-after hunger scores (Î”â€‰=â€‰2.4â€‰Â±â€‰2.0â€‰cm; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) were higher with HFCS overfeeding.


CONCLUSIONS
The dietary carbohydrate source while overeating did not affect 24-hour EE, but HFCS overconsumption may predispose individuals to further overeating due to increased glucocorticoid release and increased hunger the following morning.",United States,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",29193741,2017,Energy Expenditure and Hormone Responses in Humans After Overeating High-Fructose Corn Syrup versus Whole-Wheat Foods.,n
1345,"A liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of 27 glutamyl di- and tripeptides in food ingredients. Such compounds are of importance for the food industry, as they can modulate the perception of basic tastes (sweet, salty, and umami). Due to their high polarity, the hydrophilic interaction chromatography mode was selected to have sufficient retention on the column and the best separation was obtained on an amide hybrid silica stationary phase packed with 1.7Â Î¼m particles. Thorough optimization of the mobile phase was performed as the start-composition had to be free of ammonium to avoid on-column cis-trans isomerization of the first eluting proline dipeptide. A baseline separation was achieved for all Î± and Î³ isomers whereas only a partial resolution was obtained for Î³-Glu-Leu and Î³-Glu-Ile, for which only the position of a methyl group differs. A fast sample preparation, based on successive dilutions, was performed before injection into the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry system. The developed method was then applied for the semi-quantification of glutamyl di- and tri-peptides in four different food ingredients. The methodology will further support the optimization of the production processes to select the conditions for which the peptides concentrations would be the highest.

1346,"BACKGROUND
The efficacy of the Specialized Early Intervention (SEI) treatment in Denmark, the OPUS treatment, has in a randomized clinical trial proved to be very effective compared to treatment as usual, and the dissemination of SEI services is increasing in Denmark. A prerequisite for upholding positive effects along with creating new teams and preserving critical components is to ensure fidelity to the model. Currently there is no Danish fidelity scale for SEI services.


AIM
To establish a fidelity scale for SEI teams, in a brief and easily manageable form, for the use of evaluating and assessing the critical components in Danish SEI services.


METHOD
We identified essential evidence-based components of SEI services internationally and interviewed experts from five Danish SEI teams, using an adapted version of the Delphi Consensus method.


RESULTS
An 18-point fidelity scale was constructed. The scale was divided into two dimensions: one relating to the structure of the SEI team and one relating to the character and content of the SEI treatment. Each component can be rated either 1 or 0 (1 pointâ€‰=â€‰fulfilling the requirements for the components; and 0 pointâ€‰=â€‰the requirements were not met). The maximum score was a total of 18 points with 5 of the components being mandatory.

This scoping review synthesized the literature that describes the position and power of supermarkets in the Australian food system, and the implications for public health. A systematic search of peer-reviewed and grey literature identified 68 documents that described supermarket power. Implications for public health were also recorded. Data revealed that supermarkets hold a powerful position in the Australian food system, acting as the primary gatekeepers. Supermarkets have obtained instrumental, structural and discursive power from many sources that overlap and reinforce each other. Few positive public health impacts of supermarket power were identified, providing many opportunities for improvement in the domains of food governance, the food system and public health nutrition.

1348,"The Trump administration's strategy to disengage and downplay the Paris Climate Agreement will likely result in a slight decrease in the already low levels of US news media global warming coverage. This is because significant limitations with the news media's ability to adequately cover climate change predated the administration. First, studies indicate that advertising interests and editors have always challenged journalists' abilities to adequately report on climate change issues. Instead of climate change stories, editors often prefer more sensational topics that garner higher ratings and approval with advertisers. Second, the journalistic norm of balance and the role of sourcing give climate skeptics exceptional media exposure, which creates a ""false balance"" or equivalency between skeptics and scientists. Third, the massive power and influence of the fossil fuel industry's public relations arm has also had a tremendous impact on public (mis)understanding of climate change. Fourth, a trend toward declining climate change coverage and ""climate silence"" in US media is developing. Media corporations have substantially eliminated the number of environmental journalists that cover climate change. The overall effect of these limitations distorts public understanding of climate change and delays potential government action. Moving away from a predominantly commercial media system to one with a substantial non-commercial component can improve US journalism, while using advertising to increase rates for environmentally unsound products and services may also help mitigate global warming.

1351,"Nanoparticle (NP) interactions with cellular systems are influenced by both NP physico-chemical properties and the presence of surface-bound proteins that are adsorbed in biological environments. Here, we characterize cellular responses to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) functionalized with poly(MeO2 MAx -co-OEGMAy ) brushes with tunable hydrophobicity and explore how these responses are modulated by the presence or absence of serum proteins. Poly(MeO2 MAx -co-OEGMAy ) with variable composition (5-10% OEGMA) was fabricated to elicit differential hydrophobicity at 37Â°C for AgNPs capped with these copolymers. The increase in Ag-(MeO2 MAx -co-OEGMAy ) surface hydrophobicity from (x:y) = 90:10 to (x:y) = 95:5 led to enhanced cytotoxicity of L-929 fibroblasts and a concomitant increase in cell uptake and ROS generation in the presence of serum proteins. These responses were attenuated significantly in serum-free environments. Broad inhibition of PI3K-mediated endocytosis reduced both cell uptake and cytotoxicity in the presence or absence of serum proteins. In contrast, selective inhibition of clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis markedly decreased cell uptake and cytotoxicity in response to Ag-(MeO2 MA95 -co-OEGMA5 ) exclusively in the presence of serum proteins, whereas cell responses to the more hydrophilic Ag-(MeO2 MA90 -co-OEGMA10 ) were less affected by the inhibition of these pathways with or without serum proteins.

The S enantiomer was baseline resolved from its R impurity (impurity C) with a mobile phase consisting of methanol/water 100:15 without any interference coming from the other two potential chiral impurities A and B. The enantio- and chemoselective method was partially validated and compared with that reported in the United States Pharmacopeia for the drug product.

1354,"Gastrointestinal resections are a common operation and most involve an anastomosis to re-join the ends of the remaining bowel to restore gastrointestinal (GIT) continuity. While most joins heal uneventfully, in up to 26% of patients healing fails and an anastomotic leak (AL) develops. Despite advances in surgical technology and techniques, the rate of anastomotic leaks has not decreased over the last few decades raising the possibility that perhaps we do not yet fully understand this phenomenon of AL and are thus ill-equipped to prevent it. As in all complex conditions it is necessary to isolate each different aspect of disease for interrogation of its specific role, but, as we hope to demonstrate in this article, it is a dangerous oversimplification to consider any single aspect as the full answer to the problem. Instead, consideration of important individual observations in parallel could illuminate the way forward toward a possibly simple solution amidst the complexity. This article details three aspects that we believe intertwine, and therefore should be considered together in wound healing within the GIT, during post-surgical recovery: the microbiome, the host genetic makeup, and their relationship to the peri-operative inflammatory status. Each of these, alone or in combination, has been linked with various states of health and disease, and in combining these three aspects in the case of post-operative recovery from bowel resection, we may be nearer an answer to preventing anastomotic leaks than might have been thought just a few years ago.

The preferred carbon source for bacilli is glucose. We analysed the response of B. pumilus cells to glucose starvation using metabolic labelling and quantitative proteomics. Glucose starvation led to an extensive reprogramming of the protein expression pattern in B. pumilus. The amounts of proteins of the central carbon metabolic pathways (glycolysis and TCC) remained stable in starving cells. Proteins for gluconeogenesis were found in higher amounts during starvation. Furthermore, many proteins involved in acquisition and usage of alternative carbon sources were present in elevated amounts in starving cells. Enzymes for fatty acid degradation and proteases and peptidases were also found in higher abundance when cells entered stationary phase. Among the proteins found in lower amounts were many enzymes involved in amino acid and nucleotide synthesis and several NRPS and PKS proteins. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of the Hybrid Video Registry (HVR) is to assess the acute safety and efficacy of the Hybrid Approach in comparison to other contemporary methods of CTO-PCI.


BACKGROUND
Recently, multiple techniques in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) for coronary Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO) have been synthesized into a method referred to as the ""Hybrid Approach"".


METHODS
About 194 video-taped timed live cases from CTO-PCI training workshops were analyzed by independent data abstractors and compared to three contemporary CTO-PCI registries stratified by case complexity based on the J-CTO score.


RESULTS
Overall procedural success was 95% of all cases attempted with an excellent safety profile. In the most complex lesion subset, which made up 45% of all HVR cases, success was 92.8%, which was significantly higher than either the Royal Bromptom (78.9%), or Japanese-CTO (73.3%) registries, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04 Hybrid vs. Royal Brompton, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006 Hybrid vs. Japanese-CTO). The Hybrid Approach was also associated with shorter procedure times and lower contrast utilization.

1357,"A novel technique that integrates extraction and clean-up into a single step format is reported as part of the search for new sample preparation techniques in the analysis of persistent organic pollutants from complex samples. This was achieved by combining the extraction efficiency of the Soxhlet extractor, the selectivity of a size exclusion membrane and the specificity of a molecularly imprinted polymer for the extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from wastewater sludge followed by quantitation using gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The approach is described as the Soxhlet extraction membrane-assisted solvent extraction molecularly imprinted polymer technique. This technique was optimised for various parameters such as extraction solvent, reflux time and membrane acceptor phase. The applicability of the developed technique was optimised using a wastewater sludge certified reference material and then tested on real wastewater sludge samples. The method detection limits ranged from 0.14 to 12.86Â ng g-1 with relative standard deviation values for the extraction of the 16 US-EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from wastewater sludge samples ranging from 0.78 to 18%.

1359,"Mutations in SCO2 are among the most common causes of COX deficiency, resulting in reduced mitochondrial oxidative ATP production capacity, often leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To date, none of the recent pertaining reports provide deep understanding of the SCO2 disease pathophysiology. To investigate the cardiac pathology of the disease, we were the first to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from SCO2-mutated patients. For iPSC generation, we reprogrammed skin fibroblasts from two SCO2 patients and healthy controls. The first patient was a compound heterozygote to the common E140K mutation, and the second was homozygote for the less common G193S mutation. iPSC were differentiated into cardiomyocytes through embryoid body (EB) formation. To test the hypothesis that the SCO2 mutation is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities, and intracellular Ca2+ -overload resulting in functional derangements and arrhythmias, we investigated in SCO2-mutated iPSC-CMs (compared to control cardiomyocytes): (i) the ultrastructural changes; (ii) the inotropic responsiveness to Î²-adrenergic stimulation, increased [Ca2+ ]o and angiotensin-II (AT-II); and (iii) the Beat Rate Variability (BRV) characteristics. In support of the hypothesis, we found in the mutated iPSC-CMs major ultrastructural abnormalities and markedly attenuated response to the inotropic interventions and caffeine, as well as delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and increased BRV, suggesting impaired SR Ca2+ handling due to attenuated SERCA activity caused by ATP shortage.

Nutrition is a major contributing factor for immunocompetence. The aim was to assess the immune status of older after consuming a milk produced by lactating cows fed with one of the following diets: control diet(C), C+vitaminE+selenium(C+A), C+sunfloweroil(C+O), orC+sunflower oil+vitaminE+selenium(A+O).


METHODS AND RESULTS
60elderly received one of these biofortified milks during 12weeks. Immune response was assessed by measurement of the expression of COX-1,2, MCP-1, PPAR(Î´,Î± and Î²/Î´)genes, neutrophil production of oxygen reactive species induced by immune complexes, neutrophil phagocytosis and lytic activity of the alternative pathway of the complement system and cytokine levels. Variables were assessed before and after treatment. Our findings showed stability of some inflammatory mediators (complement activity and neutrophils burst) in treatment groups, except complement activity in C+A, and an increase of these markers in the C, especially reactive oxygen species production and phagocytic activity. TNF-Î± was significantly increased in all groups. In the C+A, IL-4 and IL-2 increased after treatment, and in the group that received the milk produced by cows fed with ""O"" diet CCL20 and IL-27 increased.

1361,"INTRODUCTION
The Fontan procedure is the palliative procedure for single ventricle physiology. Pulmonary resistance plays a key role in the success of this operation. There are conflicting data concerning the impact of pulmonary vasodilators on survival and functional capacity among Fontan patients.


AIM
The aim of this retrospective, single-centre, non-randomised study was to investigate the potential effect of pulmonary vasodilators on pulmonary vasculature in Fontan patients.


METHOD
Twenty-eight patients with single ventricle physiology were enrolled. Eighteen patients were treated with pulmonary vasodilators: nine patients after Glenn procedure or just after the Fontan completion (GroupA) and nine patients >5 years after Fontan completion (GroupB). Ten patients after Glenn procedure were enrolled as a control group (GroupC). The primary end point was to assess changes in haemodynamic profile and pulmonary branches' diameter after two right heart catheterisations. Adverse events were recorded.


RESULTS
Mean age Â± SD was 3.2 Â± 1.5 years (GroupA), 26.8 Â± 12.7 years (GroupB), and 3.1Â± 1.0 years (GroupC). Patients included in GroupA had reduced arterial compliance (34.3Â±15.4 vs 52.2Â±24.2 mm2 /[m2 *mmHg]; p=0.03) at baseline compared with GroupC. After treatment, Nakata index and pulmonary compliance increased in patients treated with pulmonary vasodilators (GroupA), while remaining stable in the control group (Nakata index: +26Â±24% vs -8Â±17%, p=0.003; pulmonary compliance +80Â±49% vs -5Â±30%, p=0.001). Similar results were found in Group B (Nakata index: pre-168.6Â±70.7 mm2 /m2 ; post- 204.9Â±97.5 mm2 /m2 ; p=0.026).


CONCLUSIONS
Pulmonary vasodilators reduce pulmonary artery resistance and increase vascular compliance, pulmonary artery diameter and cardiac output in Fontan patients.

This study was conducted to assess the ability of the un-calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations in the flowing water bodies of highly vulnerable small- to medium-sized watersheds. SWAT was applied to 27 watersheds, largely within the Midwest corn belt of the US, ranging from 20-386 km2 , and evaluated using consistent input datasets and an un-calibrated parameterization approach. The watersheds were selected from the Atrazine Ecological Exposure Monitoring Program and Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program, both of which contain high temporal resolution atrazine sampling data from watersheds with exceptionally high vulnerability to atrazine exposure. The model performance was assessed based upon predictions of annual maximum atrazine concentrations in 1-day and 60-day durations, predictions critical in pesticide threatened and endangered species risks assessments when evaluating potential acute and chronic exposure to aquatic organisms. The simulation results showed that for nearly half of the watersheds simulated, the un-calibrated SWAT model was able to predict annual maximum pesticide concentrations within a narrow range of uncertainty resulting from atrazine application timing patterns. Un-calibrated model's predictive performance is essential for the assessment of pesticide exposure in flowing water bodies, the majority of which have insufficient monitoring data for direct calibration, even in data-rich countries. In situations where SWAT over or under predicted the annual maximum concentrations, the magnitude of the over/under prediction was commonly under a factor of two, indicating that the model and un-calibrated parameterization approach are a capable method for predicting the aquatic exposure required to support pesticide regulatory decision-making.

Here we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by coupling the n-type BiVO4 with n-type Bi4V2O11 to create a virtual p/n junction due to the formation of a hole inversion layer at the semiconductor interface. Thus, photoelectrodes with high photovoltage outputs were synthesized. The photoelectrodes exhibited features of p- and n-type semiconductors when illuminated under an applied bias, suggesting their use as photoanode and photocathode in a dual-photoelectrode PEC cell. This concept was proved by connecting the 1 mol% W-doped BiVO4/Bi4V2O11 photoanode with the undoped BiVO4/Bi4V2O11 photocathode, which produced a high photovoltage of 1.54 V, sufficient to drive the stand-alone water splitting with 0.95% efficiency.",Germany,ChemSusChem,29193761,2017,Bismuth vanadate photoelectrodes with high photovoltage behave as photoanode and photocathode in photoelectrochemical cells for water splitting.,n

1366,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a heterogeneous, early-onset inherited retinal dystrophy, which is associated with severe visual impairment. We aimed to determine the disease-causing variants in Iranian LCA and evaluate the clinical implications. Clinically, a possible LCA disease was found through diagnostic imaging, such as fundus photography, autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography. All affected patients showed typical eye symptoms associated with LCA including narrow arterioles, blindness, pigmentary changes and nystagmus. Target exome sequencing was performed to analyse the proband DNA. A homozygous novel c.Â 2889delTÂ  (p.P963Â fs) mutation in the RPGRIP1 gene was identified, which was likely the deleterious and pathogenic mutation in the proband. Structurally, this mutation lost a retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR)-interacting domain at the C-terminus which most likely impaired stability in the RPGRIP1 with the distribution of polarised proteins in the cilium connecting process. Sanger sequencing showed complete co-segregationÂ  in this pedigree.

1367,"The role of salt in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension is not well understood. According to the current understanding, the central mechanism for blood pressure regulation relies on classical studies linking blood pressure and Na+ balance, placing the kidney at the very centre of long-term blood pressure regulation. To maintain blood pressure homeostasis, the effective circulating fluid volume and thereby body Na+ content has to be maintained within very narrow limits. From recent work in humans and rats, the notion has emerged that Na+ could be stored somewhere in the body without commensurate water retention to buffer free extracellular Na+ , and that previously unidentified extrarenal, tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms are operative regulating the release and storage of Na+ from a kidney-independent reservoir. Moreover, immune cells from the mononuclear phagocyte system not only function as local on-site sensors of interstitial electrolyte concentration, but also, together with lymphatics, act as systemic regulators of body fluid volume and blood pressure. These studies have established new and unexpected targets in studies of blood pressure control and thus the pathophysiology of hypertension; the interstitium-/extracellular matrix of the skin, its inherent interstitial fluid and the lymphatic vasculature forming a vessel network in the interstitium. Aspects of the interstitium in relation to Na+ balance and hypertension are the focus of this review. Taken together, observations of salt storage in the skin to buffer free extracellular Na+ and macrophage modulation of the extracellular matrix and lymphatics suggest that electrolyte homeostasis in the body cannot be achieved by renal excretion alone, but also relies on extrarenal regulatory mechanisms.

Many composite disease activity measures and targets have been developed for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This GRAPPA-OMERACT work stream aimed to further the development of consensus among physicians and patients.


METHODS
Prior to the meeting, physicians and patients were surveyed on outcome measures. A consensus meeting (26 rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient representatives) reviewed evidence on composite measures and potential treatment targets, plus survey results. After discussions, participants voted on proposals for use and consensus was established in a second survey.


RESULTS
Survey results from 128 HCPS and 139 patients were analysed alongside a SLR summarising evidence. A weighted vote was cast for composite measures (for RCTs, most popular measures were PASDAS [40 votes] and GRACE [28 votes]; for clinical practice, most popular were 3-VAS [45 votes], DAPSA [26 votes]). After discussion there was no consensus on a composite measure. The group agreed that several composite measures could be used.Â Future studies should allow further validation and comparison. The group unanimously agreed that remission should be the ideal target with minimal/low disease activity a feasible alternative. The target should include assessment of musculoskeletal disease, skin and health related quality of life. The group recommended a target of treatment as VLDA, or MDA.


CONCLUSIONS
Consensus was not reached on a continuous measure of disease activity. In the interim the group recommends several composites. Consensus was reached on a treatment target of VLDA/MDA.

However, the correlation between HBcAg in the hepatocyte nucleus and nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapeutic response is unclear. We sought to evaluate the role of HBcAg by analysing liver biopsies for viral response in NA-naÃ¯ve hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive (+) CHB patients via immunohistochemistry (IHC). A total of 48 HBcAg-negative (-) patients and 48 HBcAg (+) patients with matching baseline characteristics were retrospectively analysed for up to 288Â weeks. Virological response (VR) rates of patients in the HBcAg (-) group were significantly higher at week 48 and 96 than the HBcAg (+) group (77.1% versus 45.8% at week 48, respectively, PÂ =Â 0.002 and 95.3% versus 83.3% at week 96, respectively, PÂ =Â 0.045). The serological negative conversion rate of HBeAg was significantly higher in the HBcAg (-) than in the HBcAg (+) group from week 96 to 288 (35.4 % versus 14.6% at week 96, respectively, PÂ =Â 0.018; 60.4% versus 14.6%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001 at week 144; 72.9% versus 35.4%, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.001 at week 288). The cumulative frequencies of VR and lack of HBeAg were higher in the HBcAg (-) group (both PÂ <Â 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that HBcAg (-) was the predictor for the lack of HBeAg (OR 4.482, 95% CI: 1.58-12.68).

Remnant lipoproteins are thought to be atherogenic. Remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C), which reflects the levels of various kinds of remnant lipoproteins in the blood, has a significant correlation with insulin resistance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this study, we measured the effect of empagliflozin (EMPA) on the levels of RLP-C and investigated whether EMPA-mediated change in RLP-C is associated with a change in insulin resistance in type2 diabetic patients who have insulin resistance.


RESULTS
Patients were allocated to receive placebo (n = 51) or EMPA (n = 58) as an add-on treatment. Fasting blood samples were collected before and 12 weeks after this intervention. EMPA significantly decreased HbA1c, body weight, systolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, liver transaminases and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased HDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, EMPA decreased RLP-C and HOMA-R. In the placebo group, there were no significant changes in these factors except for slight increases in liver transaminases. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the change in HOMA-R (p = 0.0102) and the change in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0301) were significantly associated with the change in RLP-C in the EMPA group. The change in RLP-C significantly correlated with the change in HOMA-R (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.503 [95% CI, 0.199-0.719 ]; P=0.00241).


CONCLUSION
EMPA decreases RLP-C levels, which is closely associated with amelioration of insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients who have insulin resistance. This article is protected by copyright.

1371,"PURPOSE
Review the initial results of a single-center complete video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) sleeve lobectomy and discuss the key procedure of this operation, in addition to its safety and feasibility.


METHODS
Retrospectively analyze the perioperative data of 11 patients who accepted complete VATS sleeve lobectomy between May 2013 and Jun 2017 in Peking University Third Hospital, try to evaluate the safety of this procedure. All the patients were followed up and their oncological recurrence and metastasis were observed, and feasibility of VATS sleeve lobectomy for lung cancer was evaluated.


RESULTS
All of the 11 cases underwent complete VATS sleeve lobectomy successfully and there is no conversion to thoracotomy. The mean operative time was 338Â min (range from 243 to 511Â min), the mean time of bronchial anastomotic was 63Â min (range from 40 to 96Â min), the mean blood loss was 205Â mL (range from 50 to 400Â mL), and the mean number of lymph nodes dissected is 22.1. There was no other complication except one patient suffered from high-risk pulmonary embolism, and no anastomotic leakage and stricture was found. The mean hospital stay postoperation was 8.7 days. The time of follow-up was between 2 and 38 months, only one out of the 11 cases died of bone metastasis, and the other 10 survived till now. One of these 10 patients had local recurrence 24 months after operation, and one suffered adenocarcinoma of esophageal-gastric junction at 15 months postoperation. The rest of eight patients all survived to June 2017 and no local recurrence and metastasis was found. The mean survival time was 14.8 months.


CONCLUSION

1372,"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries present chronic loss of muscle fibers followed by expansive fibrotic tissue deposition. Regenerative medicine therapies are under development to promote regeneration. However, mitigation of the expansive fibrous tissue is required for integration with the remaining muscle. Using a porcine VML model, delayed debridement of injury fibrosis was performed 3 months post-VML and observed for an additional 4 weeks. A second group underwent the initial VML and was observed for 4 weeks, allowing comparison of initial fibrosis formation and debrided groups. The following salient observations were made: (i) debridement neither exacerbated nor ameliorated strength deficits; (ii) debridement results in recurrent fibrotic tissue deposition of a similar magnitude and composition as acute VML injury; and (iii) similarly upregulated transcriptional fibrotic and transcriptional pathways persist 4 weeks after initial VML or delayed debridement. This highlights the need for future studies to investigate adjunctive antifibrotic treatments for the fibrosed musculature.",United States,Clinical and translational science,29193769,2017,Inflammatory and Physiological Consequences of Debridement of Fibrous Tissue after Volumetric Muscle Loss Injury.,n
1373,"BACKGROUND
Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic complication that develops in 20-50% of patients after deep vein thrombosis (DVT). While individual risk factors for PTS have been characterized, the ability to predict which DVT patients are likely to develop PTS remains limited.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to develop a clinical prediction score for PTS in patients with DVT.


METHODS
The derivation cohort consisted of participants in the SOX Trial, a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of elastic compression stockings vs. placebo stockings worn for 2 years after DVT to prevent PTS in patients with a first proximal DVT, enrolled in 24 community and tertiary care hospitals from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of baseline characteristics was performed. Outcome was the occurrence of PTS, diagnosed starting from 6 months or later using Ginsberg's criteria.


RESULTS
762 patients were included in the analysis. Median follow-up was 728 days. The model includes 3 independent predictors and has a range of possible scores from 0-5. High-risk predictors were: index DVT in iliac vein; BMIâ‰¥35 kg/m2 ; and moderate-severe Villalta severity category at DVT diagnosis. Compared to patients with a score of 0, those with a score of â‰¥4 had an odds ratio of 5.9 (95% CI 2.1-16.6) for developing PTS.


CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this is the first clinical prediction score for PTS. We identified three independent predictors that, when combined, predicted risk for PTS after a first proximal DVT. The SOX-PTS score requires external validation before it can be considered for clinical use.

1374,"Akabane virus (AKAV) is teratogenic to the foetus of domestic ruminants and causes a significant reproduction loss in cattle in Japan. In several past epizootics in cattle, AKAV was also associated with post-natal encephalomyelitis, mainly in calves and young stock. Previously analysed AKAV isolates in East Asia form two major clusters, genogroups I and II, with isolates involved in encephalomyelitis belonging mainly to the former. Between 2007 and 2013, AKAV epizootics were regularly observed in Japan during the summer/autumn season, and abnormal deliveries and post-natal encephalomyelitis caused by the virus in cattle were reported. During this period, 30 AKAV isolates were obtained from diseased and sentinel cattle, a piglet and Culicoides biting midges throughout Japan and were subjected to genetic comparison and phylogenetic analysis with previous isolates. In 2007, 2011 and 2013, AKAV belonging to genogroup I was identified in the central nervous systems of calves showing neurological disorders. Notably, a total of 165 cases of bovine encephalomyelitis were reported in 2011 and the isolated viruses from affected animals shared high genetic identities with a South Korean isolate that was associated with a large outbreak in 2010, suggesting some epidemiological linkage between these epizootics. Epizootics of genogroup II were observed in 2008 and 2010, but bovine post-natal encephalomyelitis cases rarely occurred. Our findings suggest that the frequent incursion of genogroup I isolates has increased the frequency of post-natal encephalomyelitis cases in Japan in recent years. Infection by genogroup I virus was also identified in piglets with neurological disorders or congenital malformations in 2011 and 2013.

1377,"Various reports have been published regarding quantitative evaluations of intraoperative fluorescent intensity studies using indocyanine green (ICG) with videoangiography (VAG). The effects of scattering and point-spread functions (PSF) on quantitative ICG-VAG evaluations have not been investigated. Clinically, when ICG is administered through the peripheral vein, it reaches the tissue intra-arterially. To achieve more reliable intraoperative quantitative intensity evaluations, we examined the impact of high-intensity structures on close areas. The study was conducted using a phantom model and surgical fluorescent microscope. A region of interest (ROI) was created for the vessel model and another ROI was created within 3 cm of that. With an ROI of 6.8 mm in the vessel phantom model, 10% intensity was confirmed, even though there was no fluorescent structure. Intensity decreased gradually as the ROI moved further from the vessel model. Our study results suggest that the presence of a high-intensity structure and the size of the ROI may affect quantitative intensity evaluations using ICG-VAG. Results of linear regression analysis indicate that the relationship of intensity (Y) and distance (X) is as follows: Y(real/A) = 29 Exp(-0.062X) + 164.3 Exp(-1.81X).

The analytes were extracted from the sample to ionic liquid-magnetized stirring bar, then the analyte-adsorbed magnetized stirring bar can be readily isolated from the sample solution by a magnet. The key experimental parameters were investigated and optimized, including the type and volume of ionic liquid, extraction time, salt concentration, stirring speed and pH.

1379,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system.

This study is the first to evaluate the prognostic significance of CAR in stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients treated with radical surgery, as well as that of several other inflammation-based factors, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). A total of 235 patients were enrolled in this study. The optimal cut-off values of CAR and other inflammation-based factors were determined by receiver operating characteristic curves. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model analysis were performed to determine the independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). At a cut-off value of 0.15, patients with a high CAR had significantly shorter PFS and OS than those with a lower CAR (PÂ <Â 0.001). A higher CAR was significantly associated with elevated scores of NLR and PLR and a decreased PNI (PÂ <Â 0.001). Univariate analyses showed that elevated CAR preoperatively was significantly associated with poor survival; a similar trend was also noted for the NLR, PLR, and PNI.

1382,"OBJECTIVE
Diets high in saturated fat induce obesity and insulin resistance and impair insulin access to skeletal muscle, leading to reduced insulin levels at the muscle cell surface available to bind insulin receptors and induce glucose uptake. In contrast, diets supplemented with polyunsaturated fat improve insulin sensitivity (SI) and reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes. It was hypothesized that a diet high in polyunsaturated fat would preserve SI and insulin access to muscle, as compared with a diet high in saturated fat.


METHODS
After 12 weeks of control, saturated (LARD), or polyunsaturated (salmon oil [SO]) high-fat diet feeding, muscle SI and insulin access to skeletal muscle were measured by using lymph, a surrogate of skeletal muscle interstitial fluid.


RESULTS
Both high-fat diets induced similar weight gain, yet only LARD impaired SI. Hyperinsulinemia in the LARD group did not induce an increase in basal interstitial insulin, suggesting reduced insulin access to muscle after LARD, but not after SO.


CONCLUSIONS
A diet high in polyunsaturated fat does not impair insulin access to muscle interstitium or induce insulin resistance as observed with a saturated fat diet, despite similar weight gain.

To study presenting characteristics and prevalence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in Scandinavian Caucasians with treatment-naÃ¯ve exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).


METHODS
We reviewed all patients referred in year 2014 and diagnosed using fundus examination, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Details of found PCVs and its subtypes (clinical and angiographical) were correlated to the baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).


RESULTS
Of 299 Caucasian patients with a tentative diagnosis of exudative AMD, 18 eyes of 17 patients (5.7%, CI 95%: 3.5-9.1%) had PCV. Patients with PCV were 75.8 (SD: 7.5) years old and 11 (65%) were females. Lesions were predominantly extramacular. Most eyes (56%) had subretinal haemorrhage, 39% had the exudative type and one (6%) eye had the quiescent type. Larger lesion area and disruption of the foveal inner-segment/outer-segment layer correlated with worse baseline BCVA. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) type 1 was present in 50% and PCV type 2 in the other 50%. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) type 1 was associated with a worse baseline BCVA and greater lesion size.


CONCLUSION
Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is not a rare condition in Danes with exudative AMD and presents often extramacular and with haemorrhage.

To quantitatively estimate the impact of different methods for both boost volume delineation and respiratory motion compensation of [18F] FDG PET/CT images on the fidelity of planned non-uniform 'dose painting' plans to the prescribed boost dose distribution.


METHODS
Six locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were retrospectively reviewed. To assess the impact of respiratory motion, time-averaged (3D AVG), respiratory phase-gated (4D GATED) and motion-encompassing (4D MIP) PET images were used. The boost volumes were defined using manual contour (MANUAL), fixed threshold (FIXED) and gradient search algorithm (GRADIENT). The dose painting prescription of 60Â Gy base dose to the planning target volume and an integral dose of 14Â Gy (total 74Â Gy) was discretized into seven treatment planning substructures and linearly redistributed according to the relative SUV at every voxel in the boost volume. Fifty-four dose painting plan combinations were generated and conformity was evaluated using quality index VQ0.95-1.05, which represents the sum of planned dose voxels within 5% deviation from the prescribed dose. Trends in plan quality and magnitude of achievable dose escalation were recorded.


RESULTS
Different segmentation techniques produced statistically significant variations in maximum planned dose (PÂ <Â 0.02), as well as plan quality between segmentation methods for 4D GATED and 4D MIP PET images (PÂ <Â 0.05). No statistically significant differences in plan quality and maximum dose were observed between motion-compensated PET-based plans (PÂ >Â 0.75). Low variability in plan quality was observed for FIXED threshold plans, while MANUAL and GRADIENT plans achieved higher dose with lower plan quality indices.


CONCLUSIONS
The dose painting plans were more sensitive to segmentation of boost volumes than PET motion compensation in this study sample.

In the clinical study, the knife group had a higher self-sealing score (0.60Â Â±Â 0.49 points) than the FL group (0.17Â Â±Â 0.38 points). In the experimental study, the deformation rate in the knife incision (5.04Â Â±Â 1.93) was significantly lower than that in the FL with any energy. The deformation rate in the 9Â Î¼J (12.98Â Â±Â 2.76) was significantly higher than in the 3Â Î¼J (8.54Â Â±Â 2.38) and 6Â Î¼J (8.82Â Â±Â 2.85) FL energies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that the corneal stromal surface of the knife incision was smoother than that of the FL. Higher energy FL showed more irregular surfaces.


CONCLUSION
Higher FL energy tended to widen a clear corneal incision whenÂ mechanical stress was applied. The histological differences at the innerÂ tunnel surface may cause differences in wound stability of the corneal incision.",England,Acta ophthalmologica,29193782,2017,Clinical and exÂ vivo laboratory comparison of the self-sealing properties and dimensional stability between the femtosecond laser and manual clear corneal incisions.,n
1386,"Virus infection in plants involves necrosis, chlorosis and mosaic. The M strain of cucumber mosaic virus (M-CMV) has six distinct symptoms: vein clearing, mosaic, chlorosis, partial green recovery, complete green recovery and secondary mosaic. Chlorosis indicates the loss of chlorophyll which is highly abundant in plant leaves and plays essential roles in photosynthesis. Blue native/SDS-PAGE combined with mass spectrum was performed to detect the location of virus, and proteomic analysis of chloroplast isolated from virus-infected plants was performed to quantify the changes of individual proteins in order to gain a global view of the total chloroplast protein dynamics during the virus infection. Among the 438 proteins quantified, 33 showed a more than 2.0-fold change in abundance, of which 22 are involved in the light-dependent reactions and five in the Calvin cycle. The dynamic change of these proteins indicates that light-dependent reactions are down-accumulated, and the Calvin cycle was up-accumulated during virus infection. In addition to proteins involved in photosynthesis, tubulin was up-accumulated in virus-infected plant, which might contribute to the autophagic process during plant infection. In conclusion, this extensive proteomic investigation on intact chloroplasts of virus-infected tobacco leaves provided some important novel information on chlorosis mechanisms induced by virus infection.

1387,"Understanding of timing of human parturition is incomplete. Therefore, we carried out proteomic analyses of full-term placentas from uncomplicated pregnancies to identify protein signatures associated with the onset of spontaneous delivery. We found quantitative associations of 10 proteins with spontaneous term birth, evident either in the basal or in the chorionic plates or in both. Additional 18 proteins were associated according to the location within placenta indicating local variations in protein amounts. Calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain-containing 1 (CPPED1), a phosphatase previously suggested dephosphorylating AKT1/PKB, was one of the identified proteins. qRT-PCR revealed the mRNA level of CPPED1 was higher in elective caesarean deliveries than in spontaneous births, while immunohistochemistry showed CPPED1 in cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts. Noteworthy, phosphorylation status of AKT1 did not differ between placentas from elective caesarean and spontaneous deliveries. Additionally, analyses of samples from infants indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs11643593 and rs8048866 of CPPED1 were associated with duration of term pregnancy. Finally, post-transcriptional silencing of CPPED1 in cultured HTR8/SVneo cells by siRNAs affected gene expression in pathways associated with inflammation and blood vessel development. We postulate that functions regulated by CPPED1 in trophoblasts at choriodecidual interphase have a role in the induction of term labour, but it may be independent of AKT1.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193784,2017,Expression of CPPED1 in human trophoblasts is associated with timing of term birth.,n

To determine the correlation between asthma and hiatal hernia (HH) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related asthma requiring laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery.


METHODS
One hundred thirty-six GERD patients with medically refractory asthma with (80 patients) or without HH (56 patients) were enrolled. GERD was assessed by endoscopy, esophageal manometry, reflux monitoring, and symptom questionnaires, and treated with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) or LNF with concomitant hiatal hernia repair (LNF-HHR). The outcome measures included patient satisfaction and drug independence.


RESULTS
HH patients had lower esophageal sphincters (P = 0.005) and higher DeMeester scores (P = 0.014) than those without HH. After an average follow-up of 24 months, symptom scores were significantly decreased from the preoperative values (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Compared to LNF, LNF-HHR showed a better improvement in both esophageal and asthmatic symptoms (P = 0.00 and P = 0.016, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
GERD patients with asthma have a high prevalence of HH. The presence of HH maybe correlated with asthma and severe GERD. Actively treating HH not only improved reflux, but also controlled asthma symptoms. This article is protected by copyright.

Skin hyperpigmentation is the darkening of skin due to the increased production of melanin in the body.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a botanical-based Rosa E pigmentation serum in healthy fair skin female volunteers with wrinkles, skin tone, and pigmentation.


METHODS
This was a single-arm, open label study conducted in healthy Indian females; 18 subjects aged 30-55, having fair Caucasian-like skin with at least 2 dark skin pigments with facial wrinkles diagnosed by dermatologist were selected. Rosa E pigmentation serum was applied twice a day for 84 days. Effect was evaluated by (i) instrumental technique (spectrophotometerÂ® 2600D), (ii) clinically by dermatologist regarding product efficacy (skin tone, antiwrinkle, pigmentation), and (iii) volunteers self-evaluation.


RESULTS
The L* value of spectrophotometer reading represents lightness in the skin pigment. Reduction in the pigment was reported from day 14, with significant reductions observed till day 84 compared with baseline. Significant (P < .0001) skin pigmentation lightening was seen on day 14 (1.11) vastly improving on day 84 (1.94) based on photographic assessments. The significant reduction in skin pigment was 76.85%, Felix von Luschan skin color score was 30.24% (P < .0001) with a 7.38-fold reduction in skin tone and 57% reduction in facial wrinkles at day 84 from baseline.

1392,"PURPOSE
We aimed to investigate changes in retinal vascular geometry over time after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).


METHODS
Thirty-seven eyes with PDR were included. Wide-field fluorescein angiography (Optomap, Optos PLC., Dunfermline, Scotland, UK) was used to diagnose PDR at baseline and to assess activity at follow-up month three and six. At each time-point, a trained grader measured retinal vessel geometry on optic disc (OD) centred images using semiautomated software (SIVA, Singapore I Vessel Assessment, National University of Singapore, Singapore) according to a standardized protocol.


RESULTS
At baseline, the mean age and duration of diabetes were 52.8 and 22.3Â years, and 65% were male. Mean HbA1c was 69.9Â mmol/mol, and blood pressure was 155/84Â mmHg. Of the 37 eyes with PDR, eight (22%) eyes had progression at month three and 13 (35%) progressed over sixÂ months. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, blood pressure, vessel geometric variables and total amount of laser energy delivered did not differ by progression status. However, compared to patients with progression of PDR, patients with favourable treatment outcome had alterations in the retinal arteriolar structures from baseline to month six (calibre, 154.3Â Î¼m versus 159.5Â Î¼m, pÂ =Â 0.04, tortuosity 1.12 versus 1.10, pÂ =Â 0.04) and in venular structures from baseline to month three (fractal dimension 1.490 versus 1.499, pÂ =Â 0.04, branching coefficient (BC) 1.32 versus 1.37, pÂ =Â 0.01).

1394,"Interleukin-35 (IL-35), a member of the IL-12 family, functions as a new anti-inflammatory factor involved in arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other immune diseases. Although IL-35 can significantly prevent the development of inflammation in many diseases, there have been no early studies accounting for the role of IL-35 recombinant protein in IBD and psoriasis. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic potential of IL-35 recombinant protein in three well-known mouse models: the dextransulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, the keratin14 (K14)-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)-transgenic (Tg) psoriasis mouse model and the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model. Our results indicated that IL-35 recombinant protein can slow down the pathologic process in DSS-induced acute colitis mouse model by decreasing the infiltrations of macrophages, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells and by promoting the infiltration of Treg cells. Further analysis demonstrated that IL-35 recombinant protein may regulate inflammation through promoting the secretion of IL-10 and inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-Î± and IL-17 in acute colitis model. In addition, lower dose of IL-35 recombinant protein could achieve long-term treatment effects as TNF-Î± monoclonal antibody did in the psoriasis mouse. In summary, the remarkable therapeutic effects of IL-35 recombinant protein in acute colitis and psoriasis mouse models indicated that IL-35 recombinant protein had a variety of anti-inflammatory effects and was expected to become an effective candidate drug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193791,2017,IL-35 recombinant protein reverses inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis through regulation of inflammatory cytokines and immune cells.,n

Suspensors of rpl18aB expressed the embryo proper marker DRN::GFP but not the suspensor marker WOX8::GFP. In addition, auxin accumulated throughout the suspensors of rpl18aB proembryos.

1397,"BACKGROUND
Stillbirth is a global health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) application of the International Classification of Diseases for perinatal mortality (ICD-PM) aims to improve data on stillbirth to enable prevention.


OBJECTIVES
To identify globally reported causes of stillbirth, classification systems, and alignment with the ICD-PM.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, Global Health, and Pubmed from 2009 to 2016.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Reports of stillbirth causes in unselective cohorts.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Pooled estimates of causes were derived for country representative reports. Systems and causes were assessed for alignment with the ICD-PM. Data are presented by income setting (low, middle, and high income countries; LIC, MIC, HIC).


MAIN RESULTS
Eighty-five reports from 50 countries (489Â 089 stillbirths) were included. The most frequent categories were Unexplained, Antepartum haemorrhage, and Other (all settings); Infection and Hypoxic peripartum (LIC), and Placental (MIC, HIC). Overall report quality was low. Only one classification system fully aligned with ICD-PM. All stillbirth causes mapped to ICD-PM. In a subset from HIC, mapping obscured major causes.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a paucity of quality information on causesÂ of stillbirth globally. Improving investigation of stillbirthsÂ and standardisation of audit and classification is urgently needed and should be achievable in all well-resourced settings. Implementation of the WHO Perinatal Mortality Audit and Review guide is needed, particularly across high burden settings.


FUNDING
HR, SH, SHL, and AW were supported by an NHMRC-CRE grant (APP1116640). VF was funded by an NHMRC-CDF (APP1123611).


TWEETABLE ABSTRACT
Urgent need to improve data on causes of stillbirths across all settings to meet global targets.


PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Background and methods Nearly three million babies are stillborn every year. These deaths have deep and long-lasting effects on parents, health care providers, and the society. One of the major challenges to preventing stillbirths is the lack of information about why they happen. In this study, we collected reports on the causes of stillbirth from high-, middle-, and low-income countries to: (1) Understand the causes of stillbirth, and (2) Understand how to improve reporting of stillbirths. Findings We found 85 reports from 50 different countries. The information available from the reports was inconsistent and often of poor quality, so it was hard to get a clear picture about what are the causes of stillbirth across the world. Many different definitions of stillbirth were used. There was also wide variation in what investigations of the mother and baby were undertaken to identify the cause of stillbirth. Stillbirths in all income settings (low-, middle-, and high-income countries) were most frequently reported as Unexplained, Other, and Haemorrhage (bleeding). Unexplained and Other are not helpful in understanding why a baby was stillborn. In low-income countries, stillbirths were often attributed to Infection and Complications during labour and birth. In middle- and high-income countries, stillbirths were often reported as Placental complications. Limitations We may have missed some reports as searches were carried out in English only. The available reports were of poor quality. Implications Many countries, particularly those where the majority of stillbirths occur, do not report any information about these deaths. Where there are reports, the quality is often poor. It is important to improve the investigation and reporting of stillbirth using a standardised system so that policy makers and healthcare workers can develop effective stillbirth prevention programs. All stillbirths should be investigated and reported in line with the World Health Organization standards.",England,BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,29193794,2017,Making stillbirths visible: a systematic review of globally reported causes of stillbirth.,n
1398,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION
Optimal glycemic targets during short-term intensive insulin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were not standardized. This study is performed to determine the optimal glycemic targets during the therapy by analyzing the impacts of glucose levels on therapeutic outcomes.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Nighty-five subjects with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Short-term intensive insulin therapy was carried out using insulin pump to achieve and maintain glycemic targets (FBG< 6.1 mmol/L; 2hBG< 8.0 mmol/L) for 14 days, with daily eight-point capillary blood glucose profiles recorded. Patients were followed up for 1 year after discharge.


RESULTS
In most subjects mean blood glucose and glycemic excursion parameters during the therapy were controlled within the normal range. Mean blood glucose was independently associated with amelioration of acute insulin response (r= -0.25, P=0.015) and 1-year remission (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.034, 0.426), but negatively associated with more Level-1 hypoglycemia (r=-0.34, P=0.001), although major hypoglycemia was rare. Among mean blood glucose tertiles, patients in the middle (68.7%) and lower (75.0%) tertiles had higher 1-year remission rate compared with the upper tertile (32.3%, both P<0.001), while only the middle tertile didn't have increased hypoglycemia compared with the upper tertile (8.1Â±5.4 vs. 7.2Â±3.9 events/person, P=0.48).


CONCLUSIONS
Stricter glycemic control during short-term intensive insulin therapy produced more remission despite self-manageable hypoglycemia. Based on glycemic parameters in the middle mean tertile, we propose new glycemic targets that are about 0.4mmol/L lower than current ones as long-term benefit outweighs short-term risks.

1399,"INTRODUCTION
Visualization of fiducial gold markers is critical for registration on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for imaging-guided radiotherapy. Although larger markers provide better visualization on MRI, they tend to generate artifacts on CT. MRI is strongly influenced by the presence of metals, such as iron, in the body. Here we compared efficacies of a 0.5% iron-containing gold marker (GM) and a traditional non-iron-containing marker.


METHODS
Twenty-seven patients underwent CT/MRI fusion-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Markers were placed by urologists under local anesthesia. Gold Anchor (GA; diameter: 0.28Â mm; length: 10Â mm), an iron-containing marker, was placed on the right side of the prostate using a 22-G needle and VISICOIL (VIS; diameter: 0.35Â mm; length: 10Â mm), a non-iron-containing marker, was placed on the left side using a 19-G needle. T2*-weighted images MRI sequences were obtained. Two radiation oncologists and a radiation technologist evaluated and assigned scores for visual quality on a five-point scale (1, poor; 5, best visibility).


RESULTS
Artifact generation on CT was slightly greater with GA than with VIS. The mean marker visualization scores on MRI of all three observers were significantly superior for GA than for VIS (3.5 vs 3.2, 3.9 vs 3.2, and 4.0 vs 2.9). The actual size of the spherical GA was about 2Â mm in diameter, but the signal void on MRI was approximately 5Â mm.


CONCLUSION
Although both markers were well visualized and can be recommended clinically, the results suggest that GA has some subtle advantages for quantitative visualization that could prove useful in certain situations of stereotactic body radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.",Australia,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,29193796,2017,Visibility of an iron-containing fiducial marker in magnetic resonance imaging for high-precision external beam prostate radiotherapy.,n
1400,"Despite progress in diagnostics and treatment for preeclampsia, it remains the foremost cause of maternal and foetal perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over recent years, various lines of evidence have emphasized long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which function as an innovative regulator of biological behaviour, as exemplified by proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis. However, the role of lncRNAs has not been well described in preeclampsia. Here, we identified a lncRNA, PVT1, whose expression was down-regulated in qRT-PCR analyses in severe preeclampsia. The effects of PVT1 on development were studied after suppression and overexpression of PVT1 in HTR-8/SVneo and JEG3 cells. PVT1 knockdown notably inhibited cell proliferation and stimulated cell cycle accumulation and apoptosis. Exogenous PVT1 significantly increased cell proliferation. Based on analysis of RNAseq data, we found that PVT1 could affect the expression of numerous genes, and then investigated the function and regulatory mechanism of PVT1 in trophoblast cells. Further mechanistic analyses implied that the action of PVT1 is moderately attributable to its repression of ANGPTL4 via association with the epigenetic repressor Ezh2. Altogether, our study suggests that PVT1 could play an essential role in preeclampsia progression and probably acts as a latent therapeutic marker; thus, it might be a useful prognostic marker when evaluating new therapies for patients with preeclampsia.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193797,2017,The long non-coding RNA PVT1 represses ANGPTL4 transcription through binding with EZH2 in trophoblast cell.,n

The compounds were screened in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Antimalarial activities (IC50) against Pf drug sensitive NF54, and drug resistant K1 and W2 strains ranged from 0.03 - 2.6, 0.03 - 1.9 and 0.02 - 1.7 ÂµM. Although the compounds are less active than the precursor artemisinin derivatives, the cholesterol moiety renders the compounds relatively insoluble in the culture medium, and variation in solubilities among the different compounds may reflect in the range of efficacies observed. Activities against Mtb H37Rv were assessed using a standardized CFU assay after 24 h pretreatment of cultures with each of the compounds. Percentage inhibition ranged from 3 - 38% and 18 - 52% at 10 and 80 ÂµM, respectively. Thus, in contrast to the comparator drug artemether, the conjugates display enhanced activities.

1403,"AIM
Glucagon-like peptide-1 is an incretin hormone secreted by the intestinal L-cell with a circadian rhythm that parallels expression of the core clock gene, Bmal1. Although feeding rats a high-fat/high-sucrose Western diet impairs rhythmic glucagon-like peptide-1 release, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the pathway(s) by which the saturated fat, palmitate, a major component of the Western diet, impairs circadian glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.


METHODS
Murine mGLUTag L-cells were synchronized and the effects of palmitate pre-treatment on gene expression and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion were determined, in addition to metabolite quantification, mitochondrial function analysis, and enzyme inhibition and activation assays. Glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion was also analyzed in ileal crypt cultures from control and Bmal1 knockout mice.


RESULTS
Pre-treatment with palmitate dampened Bmal1 mRNA and protein expression and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion at 8 but not 20 hours after cell synchronization (p<0.05-0.001). Glucagon-like peptide-1 release was also impaired in Bmal1 knockout cultures as compared to wild-type controls (p<0.001). Palmitate pre-treatment reduced expression of the Bmal1 downstream target, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of NAD+ . This was paralleled by dampening of total NAD+ levels, as well as impaired mitochondrial function and ATP production (p<0.05-0.001). Whereas direct inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase also decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 release, activation of this enzyme restored glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in the presence of palmitate.


CONCLUSION
Palmitate impairs L-cell clock function at the peak of Bmal1 gene expression, thereby impairing mitochondrial function and ultimately rhythmic glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.

1404,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multi-arm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of LGMs, how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model in order to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network.

1406,"In this work, a polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber overcoated with a layer of polydimethylsiloxane was evaluated as analytical sampling tool for the first time in human urine. Urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 2-6 aromatic rings were considered as target compounds. The analyte uptake in kinetic and thermodynamic regime was evaluated and compared to the performances of polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene and polydimethylsiloxane fibers. The assessment of the robustness and endurance of the overcoated fiber was carried out by direct immersion solid-phase microextraction in undiluted urine performing up to 120 consecutive extractions. The overcoated fiber was then used to develop a fast and easy direct immersion solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry protocol for the quantification of the target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The attained values of accuracy and precision were 75-114% and 2-19%, respectively, while the limits of quantification ranged between 0.05 and 1Â ng/L. The proposed protocol was applied to the screening of urine samples collected from smoking and non-smoking volunteers.

1409,"BACKGROUND
The Asian Long-horned Beetle (ALB; Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky)), is an invasive, wood-boring insect posing significant economic and ecological threats to the deciduous forests of North America. An efficacious and environmentally acceptable chemical control technique is a requirement of a comprehensive, integrated response strategy.


RESULTS
Results of this study demonstrate statistically significant, concentration-dependent effects of azadirachtins, a family of natural compounds derived from the neem tree, on both ALB larval and adult life-stages. Growth inhibitory effects on ALB larvae were greatest on early life stages. Significant effects on adults included inhibition of female feeding, oviposition effort and fecundity for adults exposed to azadirachtins via maturation feeding on systemically loaded twigs.


CONCLUSIONS
These quarantine laboratory experiments verify multi-mechanistic, deleterious effects on both larval and adult life stages of ALB as an exotic, invasive insect pest of critical importance in North America. Field efficacy studies are required to further understand dose acquisition by larval and adult ALB life-stages following systemic injections to host trees under semi-operational use scenarios. Such studies could also be used to test postulates regarding optimal deployment strategies to meet objectives such as slowing the spread of this pest and protection of high value deciduous forest resources.",England,Pest management science,29193806,2017,Inhibition of larval growth and adult fecundity in Asian Long-horned Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) exposed to azadirachtins under quarantine laboratory conditions.,n
1410,"BACKGROUND
Increasing climatic average temperatures and variability elicit various insect physiological responses that affect fitness and survival and may influence subsequent trophic interactions in agroecosystems. In line with this background, we investigated short and long-term plastic responses to temperature of laboratory-reared stemborer, Chilo partellus and its larval endoparasitoid, Cotesia flavipes.


RESULTS
Rapid cold- and -heat hardening effects in C. partellus larvae, pupae and adults and C. flavipes adults were highly significant (P Ë‚ 0.001). High temperature acclimation improved critical thermal limits and heat knock-down time in C. partellus larvae and C. flavipes adults respectively. However, low temperature acclimation enhanced supercooling point in C. flavipes and chill coma recovery time in both C. partellus larvae and C. flavipes adults.


CONCLUSION
Current results suggest thermal plasticity may enhance these two species survival to lethal low and high temperatures. However, C. partellus appear more plastic compared to C. flavipes. Results have three major implications: 1) C. partellus may inhabit slightly warmer environments than C. flavipes suggesting potential mismatch in biogeography, 2) host-parasitoid relationships are complex and are likely trait dependent, and 3) host-parasitoid differential thermal plastic responses may offset biocontrol efficacy. These results may help inform biocontrol decision making under global change.",England,Pest management science,29193807,2017,Thermal plasticity potentially mediates the interaction between host Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and endoparasitoid Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) under rapidly changing environments.,n

A total of 66 isolates of Brucella were recovered from sheep and yaks in the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Gansu provinces of northwest China in 2015 and 2016. Using classical biotyping and the Brucella AMOS PCR assay, all isolates were identified as Brucella melitensis biovar 3 (nÂ =Â 58), B.Â melitensis biovar 1 (nÂ =Â 1), Brucella abortus (nÂ =Â 5), or Brucella suis biovar 3 (nÂ =Â 2), and B.Â melitensis biovar 3 was found to be mainly responsible for sheep brucellosis in northwest China. Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) was used to identify the epidemiological relationships among the isolates and to assess their genetic diversity. Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis-16 identified 46 genotypes in these populations, including 37 unique and nine shared genotypes. Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis-11 showed that 71% of the isolates (47 of 66) were genotype 116 (1-5-3-13-2-2-3-2-4-41-8), a characteristic subgroup of the East Mediterranean group, showing that isolates from different geographical areas exhibit similar epidemiological characteristics in different regions and may be epidemiologically linked.

1412,"A facile headspace single drop microextraction method was developed using deep eutectic solvent based magnetic bucky gel as the extraction solvent for the first time. The hydrophobic magnetic bucky gel was formed by combining choline chloride/chlorophenol deep eutectic solvent and magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposite. Magnetic susceptibility, high viscosity, high sorbing ability and tunable extractability of organic analytes are the desirable advantages of the prepared gel. Using rod magnet as suspensor in combination with the magnetic susceptibility of the prepared gel resulted in a highly stable droplet. This stable droplet eliminated the possibility of drop dislodgement. The prepared droplet made it possible to complete the extraction process in high temperatures and elevated agitation rates. Furthermore, using larger micro-droplet volumes without any operational problems became possible. These facts resulted in shorter sample preparation time, higher sensitivity of the method and lower detection limits. Under the optimized conditions, an enrichment factor of 520-587, limit of detection of 0.05-0.90Â ng/mL, and linearity range of 0.2-2000Â ng/mL (coefficient of determinationÂ =Â 0.9982-0.9995) were obtained.

1415,"PURPOSE
To highlight the variations in published definitions of hypotony and their impact on reported clinical outcomes. To propose a revised definition, focusing on clinically significant hypotony (CH).


METHODS
Literature review of hypotony definitions published between January 2010 and December 2015 was carried out. Numerical definitions for hypotony, its onset, duration and associated clinical signs were recorded. Each definition was applied to surgical outcomes data collected prospectively from a cohort of 300 glaucoma patients treated at a single centre. The sensitivity and specificity of each definition in identifying CH [defined as low intraocular pressure (IOP) with signs of maculopathy hypotony and choroidal detachment] were calculated.


RESULTS
A total of 128 eligible papers were identified, and 14 different definitions for hypotony were extracted. In 53 (41.4%), hypotony was not defined. In the remaining 75 (58.6%), the numerical definitions varied between 4 and 8Â mmHg, and of these, 24 (32%) included the onset and duration of hypotony as part of the definition. Definition-dependent hypotony rates within the cohort varied between 1% and 59.3%. No statistical differences were found between the groups based on corneal thickness or axial length. Clinically significant hypotony (CH) was identified in 37 (12.3%), with large differences in the sensitivity and specificity among published definition.


CONCLUSION
Variations in defining postoperative hypotony can have a large impact on the reported success and failure rates among studies.

1417,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the frequency and predictors of hospital admissions for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in moderately preterm (MP, 32+0 to 33+6 weeks) and late preterm (LP, 34+0 to 36+6 weeks) infants compared to term (T â‰¥37 weeks) and very preterm (VP, <32+0 weeks) infants.


STUDY DESIGN
This national register-based study covered all infants born in Finland in 1991-2008. Data on 1â€‰018â€‰256 infants were analyzed in four gestational age-based groups: VP (nâ€‰=â€‰6329), MP (nâ€‰=â€‰6796), LP (nâ€‰=â€‰39â€‰928), and T (nâ€‰=â€‰965â€‰203) groups. Data on hospital admissions due to bronchiolitis/bronchitis and pneumonia were collected up to the age of 7 years.


RESULTS
Hospital admissions for LRTIs were more common in the MP and LP groups than in the T group but less frequent than in the VP group: bronchiolitis/bronchitis (VP 24.4%, MP 13.9%, LP 9.5%, and T 5.6%) and pneumonia (VP 8.8%, MP 4.5%, LP 3.3%, and T 2.4%). Compared to the term group, MP and LP birth predicted bronchiolitis/bronchitis (MP OR 1.89; 95%CI 1.75-2.03, LP 1.51; 1.45-1.56) and pneumonia (MP 1.49; 1.32-1.67, LP 1.25; 1.18-1.33) admissions. Statistically significant risk factors for LRTIs included maternal smoking, cesarean section, male sex, admission to a neonatal unit and ventilator therapy. In addition, being first-born, being born SGA and neonatal antibiotic therapy were associated with bronchiolitis/bronchitis.

1419,"OBJECTIVE
Obesity is a major risk factor for multiple diseases and is in part heritable, yet the majority of causative genetic variants that drive excessive adiposity remain unknown. Here, outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats were used in controlled environmental conditions to fine-map novel genetic modifiers of adiposity.


METHODS
Body weight and visceral fat pad weights were measured in male HS rats that were also genotyped genome-wide. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified by genome-wide association of imputed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes using a linear mixed effect model that accounts for unequal relatedness between the HS rats. Candidate genes were assessed by protein modeling and mediation analysis of expression for coding and noncoding variants, respectively.


RESULTS
HS rats exhibited large variation in adiposity traits, which were highly heritable and correlated with metabolic health. Fine-mapping of fat pad weight and body weight revealed three QTL and prioritized five candidate genes. Fat pad weight was associated with missense SNPs in Adcy3 and Prlhr and altered expression of Krtcap3 and Slc30a3, whereas Grid2 was identified as a candidate within the body weight locus.

C-phycocyanin is a blue-colored accessory photosynthetic pigment with multiple applications in food industry as natural dye or additive, and in pharmaceuticals. This study presents a simple protocol for the extraction and purification of food-grade C-phycocyanin from Arthrospira platensis. The cell lysis of cyanobacterium was performed by sonication combined with repeated freezing and thawing cycles. The purification of the crude extract of C-phycocyanin was carried out by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography resulting in 2.5 purity. The purity of phycocyanobilin chromophore has been tested by UV-visible spectrophotometry by monitoring the absorption after each stage of purification. An high-performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and validated for the determination of food-grade C-phycocyanin.

1422,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the effect of selexipag, an oral, selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonist, on the frequency of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).


METHODS
Patients with SSc-related RP were randomized 1:1 to placebo (n = 38) or selexipag (n = 36) in individualized doses (maximum of 1,600 Î¼g twice daily) during a 3-week titration period. The primary end point was the weekly average number of RP attacks during the study maintenance period, analyzed using a Bayesian approach with a negative binomial model adjusted for baseline number of RP attacks. Other outcome measures included Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS), RP attack duration, and treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs).


RESULTS
Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. For 83.3% of patients, the individualized maintenance dosage of selexipag was â‰¤800 Î¼g twice daily. No significant difference was observed between placebo and selexipag in weekly average number of electronic diary (eDiary)-recorded RP attacks during the maintenance period (14.2 attacks during the maintenance period and 21.5 attacks during the baseline week in the placebo group [n = 32] versus 18.0 attacks during the maintenance period and 22.4 attacks during the baseline week in the selexipag group [n = 27]; adjusted mean treatment difference of 3.4 in favor of placebo). No significant treatment effect was observed on RCS or RP attack duration.

The thoracic limbs are used to break open ant nests, dig for food and expand previously occupied burrows. This study describes the osteology and radiological anatomy of the thoracic limbs of this threatened species. Thoracic limbs from four Temminck's ground pangolins, which succumbed from electrocution or natural causes, were digitally radiographed in situ. The individual bones were then cleaned, described and digitally radiographed. The skeleton of the thoracic limbs revealed a similar number and arrangement of bones compared to that of domestic carnivores. The bones were robust and displayed numerous open epiphyseal lines. The latter provide an estimate of sexual maturity and should not be confused with fractures in injured ground pangolins. The scapula was broad and triangular-shaped. The humerus displayed a massive medial epicondyle. The radius and ulna were similarly sized, and displayed a broad radial trochlea and large olecranon tuber, respectively. The manus was composed of seven carpal bones, five short metacarpal bones and five digits of which the three central digits were the best developed. The unguicular process of the distal phalanx was bifid and elongated. The osteological characteristics indicate that the thoracic limbs of Temminck's ground pangolin are specifically adapted for protraction and retraction, strong elbow extension, flexion of the carpus and digits as well as pronation and supination of the antebrachium, as opposed to weight-bearing.

1425,"PURPOSE
The evaluation of visual acuity (VA) and refraction in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort Eye study was performed using the Nidek AR-360A autorefractometer. The accuracy of the method for this population-based screening study was assessed.


METHODS
Measurements of the refractive error were obtained from the right eyes of 1238 subjects (mean age 47), first objectively with the AR-360A and then subjectively by an optometrist. Agreement with the subjective refraction was calculated for sphere, cylinder, mean spherical equivalent (MSE), cylindrical vectors J45 and J0 and presbyopic correction (add). Visual acuity (VA) was measured using an ETDRS chart and the autorefractometer.


RESULTS
The refractive error measured with the AR-360A was higher than the subjective refraction performed by the optometrist for sphere (0.007 DÂ Â±Â 0.24 D pÂ =Â 0.30) and also for cylinder (-0.16 DÂ Â±Â 0.20 D pÂ <Â 0.0005). The bias between the measurements of MSE, J45 and J0 was low: -0.07 DÂ Â±Â 0.22 D (pÂ =Â 0.002), 0.01 DÂ Â±Â 0.43 D (pÂ =Â 0.25) and -0.01 DÂ Â±Â 0.42 D (pÂ =Â 0.43), respectively.

Mechanisms of decline in virus filter performance due to membrane fouling were investigated using a cellulose-based virus filter as a model membrane. Filter performance was critically dependent on solution conditions; specifically, ionic strength. To understand the interaction between immunoglobulin G (IgG) and cellulose, sensors coated with cellulose were fabricated for surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance with energy dissipation measurements. The primary cause of flux decline appeared to be irreversible IgG adsorption on the surface of the virus filter membrane. In particular, post-adsorption conformational changes in the IgG molecules promoted further irreversible IgG adsorption, a finding that could not be adequately explained by DLVO theory. Analyses of adsorption and desorption and conformational changes in IgG molecules on cellulose surfaces mimicking cellulose-based virus removal membranes provide an effective approach for identifying ways of optimizing solution conditions to maximize virus filter performance.

Measures of social attention, assessed via eye-gaze tracking (EGT), have been proposed as an early efficacy biomarker for clinical trials targeting social communication skills. EGT measures have been shown to differentiate children with ASD from typical children; however, there is less known about their relationships with social communication outcome measures that are typically used in ASD clinical trials. In the present study, an EGT task involving viewing a videotape of an actor making bids for a child's attention was evaluated in 25 children with ASD aged 24-72 months. Children's attention to the actor during the dyadic bid condition measured via EGT was found to be strongly associated with five well-validated caregiver-reported outcome measures that are commonly used to assess social communication in clinical trials.

Cells in the hydrogel elongated and connected to each other as observed by fluorescence images and SEM analysis after three weeks in the culture medium and cells were seen to be distributed throughout the hydrogel bulk. Cells were found to synthesize collagen types I and V, decorin and biglycan (representative collagens and proteoglycans of human corneal stroma, respectively) showing that keratocytes maintained their functions and preserved their phenotypes in the hydrogels. Transparency of cell loaded and cell free hydrogels after 21 days was found to be over 90% at all time points in the visible light range and was comparable to the transparency of the native cornea. The corneal stroma equivalent produced in this study that has cells entrapped in it leads to a product with homogenous distribution of cells. It was transparent at the very beginning and is expected to allow better vision than nontransparent substrates. It, therefore, has a significant potential to be used as an alternative to the current products used to treat corneal blindness.",England,Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,29193831,2017,Mimicking Corneal Stroma Using Keratocyte Loaded Photopolymerizable Methacrylated Gelatin Hydrogels.,n
1435,"Municipalities and cities face myriad challenges with regard to planning; decisions that will have long-standing consequences need to be made in the context of pressing present concerns, constrained budgets, and uncertainty about the future under climate changes. Compounding the challenge may be a lack of clear signals from the state and federal leadership on investment priorities. This paper contends that existing strategies from decision science can prove useful for local governments as they seek actions that are robust to uncertain futures and broadly beneficial across sectors and time horizons. An illustrative example of decision making with scenario analysis demonstrates how a city can prioritize funding and to elevate the baseline functionality of its infrastructure and well-being of its residents, regardless of when and how climate hazards occur.

1436,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) on uroflowmetry (UF) parameters among men with baseline peak flow rates (PFR) <10â€‰mL/s.


METHODS
A single-surgeon RARP database of 1082 men who underwent prospective UF testing was analyzed. Men filled out International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaires and underwent uroflowmetry and post-void bladder ultrasound before surgery and at each follow-up visit. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on preoperative PFR: those with PFR <10â€‰mL/s (nâ€‰=â€‰158) and those with PFR â‰¥10â€‰mL/s (nâ€‰=â€‰924). Univariate and multivariate regression models tested the association of preoperative characteristics in predicting postoperative PFR improvement. Within the PFR <10â€‰mL/s group, preoperative variables were analyzed to predict pathologic outcomes.


RESULTS
Threeâ€‰months after RARP, men with baseline PFR <10â€‰mL/s had a 3-fold improvement in PFR (from mean of 7.0 to 24.2â€‰mL/s), whereas in men with PFR â‰¥10â€‰mL/s there was a 50% improvement (from mean of 19.7 to 28.9â€‰mL/s; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Improvement in PFR remained stable for >5â€‰years, but mean postoperative PFR was 20% lower in men with baseline PFR <10â€‰mL/s. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen (odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.95) and PFR (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34-0.80) were independent predictors of the percentage improvement in men with baseline PFR <10â€‰mL/s. Preoperative PFR â‰¤7â€‰mL/s was an independent predictor of Gleason score â‰¥8 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.016), seminal vesicle invasion (Pâ€‰=â€‰.010), and lymph node invasion (0.029).


CONCLUSIONS
After RARP, PFR improved significantly, with the improvement persisting over long-term follow-up. However, men with baseline PFR <10â€‰mL/s had a 20% lower postoperative PFR over 5â€‰years, suggesting permanent damage to the bladder and the need for early treatment to maintain bladder health.

1437,"BACKGROUND
We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the health benefits of environmental enhancement and conservation activities. We were concerned that a conventional process of study identification, focusing on exhaustive searches of bibliographic databases as the primary search method would be ineffective, offering limited value. The focus of this study is comparing study identification methods. We compare: (i) an approach led by searches of bibliographic databases to (ii) an approach led by supplementary search methods. We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness and value of both approaches.


METHODS
Effectiveness' was determined by comparing: 1) the total number of studies identified and screened and, 2) the number of includable studies uniquely identified by each approach. 'Value' was determined by comparing included study quality and by using qualitative sensitivity analysis to explore the contribution of studies to the synthesis.


RESULTS
The bibliographic databases approach identified 21,409 studies to screen and two included qualitative studies were uniquely identified. Study quality was moderate and contribution to the synthesis was minimal. The supplementary search approach identified 453 studies to screen and nine included studies were uniquely identified. Four quantitative studies were poor quality but made a substantive contribution to the synthesis; Five studies were qualitative: three studies were good quality, one was moderate quality, and one study was excluded from the synthesis due to poor quality. All four included qualitative studies made significant contributions to the synthesis.

1438,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the risk for the need of spine surgery, including cervical and lumbar spine surgeries in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) compared with those without the disease.


METHODS
A secondary data analysis was conducted using population-based claims data from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Adult patients with newly diagnosed AS between January 2000 and December 2012, were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification code 720.0. A comparison cohort was assembled using frequency-matched sex, 10-year age intervals, and index year with the AS cohort at a ratio of 5:1. All patients were followed until our study outcomes (any spine surgery, cervical spine surgery, and lumbar spine surgery), based on surgical codes, had occurred or the end of the follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression models.


RESULTS
We identified 3,462 patients with AS and 17,310 patients without AS. All three outcome variables exhibited a significantly higher incidence in the AS cohort compared with the comparison cohort: IRR=2.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.92-2.87) for any spine surgery, IRR=2.36 (95% CI=1.55-3.59) for cervical spine surgery, and IRR=2.33 (95% CI=1.85-2.93) for lumbar spine surgery. Moreover, the magnitudes of the IRRs were the largest in the youngest age group of 20s and 30s.


CONCLUSION
Patients with AS, particularly those in their 20s and 30s, had a significantly higher risk for the need of any spine surgery, cervical spine surgery, and lumbar spine surgery compared with patients without AS.

1440,"OBJECTIVE
We investigated whether weight change during the early RA period was associated with subsequent mortality and evaluated for an RA-specific effect.


METHODS
We identified incident RA during the Nurses' Health Study (1976-2016) and created a comparison cohort, matching each RA case with up to 10 non-RA comparators by age and year of RA diagnosis (index date). To capture weight change around the early RA period (""peri-RA/index""), we used weight measures 2-4 years before and after index date. Cox regression estimated HRs for mortality by peri-RA/index weight change categories separately in each cohort and combined, evaluating for an RA-specific effect.


RESULTS
Among 121,701 women, 902 developed incident RA, matched to 7,884 non-RA comparators. There were 371(41.1%) deaths in the RA cohort during mean 17.0 years follow-up after the early RA period and 2,303(29.2%) deaths among comparators during mean 18.4 years follow-up. Peri-RA weight loss >30 lb had HR of 2.78 (95%CI1.58-4.89) for mortality compared to stable weight; the comparison cohort had similar results (HR 2.16, 95%CI1.61-2.88). Weight gain >30 lb had no association with mortality among RA (HR 1.45, 95%CI0.69-3.07) or comparators (HR 1.19, 95%CI0.89-1.59). There was no interaction between RA/comparator status and weight change for mortality (pinteraction =0.68).


CONCLUSION
Severe weight loss during the early RA period was associated with increased subsequent mortality risk for women with and without RA. These results extend prior observations by including non-RA comparators and finding no protective association between weight gain and mortality, arguing against an RA-specific obesity paradox for mortality.

1442,"BACKGROUND
Noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has recently been reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). Implementation of the new terminology may alter the implied risk of malignancy (ROM) across the six categories of The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC).


METHODS
The study cohort consisted of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) cases which were assessed between January 2011 and June 2016 and led to surgical resections. For each case, patient demographics as well as cytologic and corresponding histologic diagnoses were recorded. The surgical specimens diagnosed as follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC) were re-reviewed to identify cases that met the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. The ROM with and without exclusion of NIFTP from malignant categorization, as well as the relative change in ROM were calculated for individual categories of TBSRTC.


RESULTS
A total of 908 FNA cases with surgical follow-up were retrieved and PTC was identified in 252 (27.8%) surgical specimens. Twenty-nine of 252 (11.5%) were initially classified as FVPTC, of which 17 (6.7%) were reclassified as NIFTP. The cytologic interpretations for the majority of NIFTP cases were atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS, nâ€‰=â€‰8) or follicular neoplasm/suspicious for neoplasm/(FN/SFN, nâ€‰=â€‰4). Excluding NIFTP from malignant categorization resulted in a relative decrease in ROM in AUS/FLUS (25.8%) and FN/SFN (22.3%) categories.

1443,"OBJECTIVE
Obesity is implicated in RA development, severity, outcomes and treatment response. We estimated the independent effects of overweight and obesity on ability to achieve sustained remission (sREM) in the three years following RA diagnosis.


METHODS
Data were from the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort, a multicenter observational trial of ERA patients treated by rheumatologists using guideline-based care. sREM was defined as DAS28 <2.6 for two consecutive visits. Patients were stratified by BMI (healthy [18.5-24.9]; overweight [25-29.9]; and obese [â‰¥30]). Cox regression was used to estimate the effect of BMI category on probability of achieving sREM over the first 3 years, controlling for age, sex, race, education, RA duration, smoking status, comorbidities, baseline DAS28, HAQ-DI, CRP, and initial treatment.


RESULTS
Of 982 patients, 315 (32%) had a healthy BMI, 343 (35%) were overweight, and 324 (33%) were obese; 355 (36%) achieved sREM within 3 years. Initial treatment did not differ by BMI category. Compared to healthy BMI, overweight (HR= 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.98) and obese (HR= 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71) patients were significantly less likely to achieve sREM.


CONCLUSION
Rates of overweight and obesity were high (69%) in this ERA cohort. Overweight patients were 25%, and obese patients were 47% less likely to achieve sREM in the first 3 years despite similar initial DMARD treatment and subsequent biologic use. This is the largest study demonstrating the negative impact of excess weight on RA disease activity and supports a call to action to better identify and address this risk in RA patients.

1444,"Supported liquid membranes (SLMs) based on ionic liquids (ILs) with not only high gas permeability and selectivity, but also high stability under high pressure, are highly desired for gas separation applications. In this work, permeable and selective polyamide network (PN) layers are deposited on the surface of SLMs by utilizing the cross-linking reaction of trimesoyl chloride, which was pre-dispersed in the SLMs, and vapor of amine linkers. The vapor cross-linking method makes it easy to control the growth and aggregation of PN layers, owing to the significantly reduced reaction rate, and thereby ensuring the good distribution of PN layers on the surface of SLMs. With rational choice of amine linkers and optimization of vapor cross-linking conditions, the prepared sandwich-like PN@SLMs with ILs embedded homogeneously within polymeric matrices displayed much-improved CO2 permeability and CO2 /N2 selectivity in relation to the pristine SLMs. Moreover, those SLMs with ILs impregnated into porous supports physically displayed improved stability under high pressure after vapor cross-linking, because the PN layers formed on the surface of SLMs help prevent the ILs from being squeezed out.

The association between severe GI dysmotility and clinical and serological features was examined using logistic regression. Baseline data were examined to determine predictors of developing severe GI dysfunction using Cox regression.


RESULTS
SSc patients with severe GI dysmotility (n=66) were more likely than those patients with mild GI symptoms (n=1,736) to be male (OR 2.47, 95%CI 1.34, 4.56;p=0.004), have myopathy (OR 5.53, 95%CI 2.82, 10.82; p <0.001), and sicca symptoms (OR 2.40, 95%CI 1.30, 4.42; p=0.005), even after adjusting for potential confounders.

In this study, the mechanical properties of chitosan beads were greatly improved through utilizing the slow rate of the sodium bicarbonate-induced chitosan gelation and combining it with the chemical cross-linking action of glutaraldehyde (GA). The GA-treated sodium bicarbonate-gelled chitosan beads exhibited much better mechanical properties and up to 2.45-fold higher observed activity of the immobilized enzyme (Î²-D-galactosidase (Î²-gal)) when compared to the GA-treated sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP)-gelled chitosan beads. The differences between the sodium bicarbonate-gelled and the TPP-gelled chitosan beads were proven visually and also via scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the optimum pH, the optimum temperature, the apparent Km , and the apparent Vmax of the Î²-gals immobilized onto the two aforementioned types of chitosan beads were determined and compared. A reusability study was also performed. This study proved the superiority of the sodium bicarbonate-gelled chitosan beads as they retained 72.22Â±4.57% of their initial observed activity during the 13th reusability cycle whereas the TPP-gelled beads lost their activity during the first four reusability cycles, owing to their fragmentation.

However, the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of these compounds has yet to be determined. In order to investigate the PK profile of these compounds, a series of halogenated pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine compounds was synthesized and first tested for activity in various cancer cell lines, as well as in a mouse model. EC50 values ranged from 0.014 - 14.5 ÂµM, and maximum tolerated doses (MTD) in mice were between 5-10 mg/kg. This indicates a wide variance in activity and toxicity that needed further study. To decrease toxicity, a second series of compounds were synthesized with N5 alkyl substitutions in an effort to slow the rate of metabolism, which was thought to be leading to the toxicity. The N-substituted compounds demonstrated comparable cell line activity (EC50 values between 0.83 - 7.3 ÂµM) with significantly decreased toxicity (MTD = 40 mg/kg). Finally, the PK profile of the best compound shows an average plasma half-life of 32.7 minutes, and rapid conversion of the N-substituted compound into the parent unsubstituted analogue.

Benzodiazepine treatment, acting via GABAA receptors, improves social interaction in male mouse models with autism-like features. The protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) can act as an endogenous benzodiazepine, but a role for DBI in social behavior has not been described. Here we investigated the role of DBI in the social interest and recognition behavior of mice. The responses of DBI wild-type and knockout male and female mice to ovariectomized female wild-type mice (a neutral social stimulus) were evaluated in a habituation/dishabituation task. Both male and female knockout mice exhibited reduced social interest, and DBI knockout mice lacked the sex difference in social interest levels observed in wild-type mice, in which males showed higher social interest levels than females. The ability to discriminate between familiar and novel stimulus mice (social recognition) was not impaired in DBI-deficient mice of either sex. DBI knockouts could learn a rotarod motor task, and could discriminate between social and non-social odors. Both sexes of DBI knockout mice showed increased repetitive grooming behavior, but not in a manner that would account for the decrease in social investigation time. Genetic loss of DBI did not alter seminal vesicle weight, indicating that the social interest phenotype of males lacking DBI is not due to reduced circulating testosterone.

1452,"INTRODUCTION
Pseudoprogression (psPD) is a transient post-treatment imaging change that is commonly seen when treating glioma with chemotherapy and radiation. The use of apparent transverse relaxation rate (R2âˆ—), which is calculated from a contrast-free multi-echo gradient echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequence, may allow for quantitative identification of patients with suspected psPD.


METHODS
We acquired a multi-echo gradient echo sequence using a 3T-Siemens Prisma MRI. The signal decay through the echoes was fitted to provide the R2âˆ— coefficient. We segmented the T1 -gadolinium enhancing the image to provide a contrast enhancing lesion (CEL) and the FLAIR hyperintensity to provide a non-enhancing lesion (NEL). These regions of interest were applied to the multi-echo gradient echo to acquire a mean R2âˆ— within the CEL and NEL. We additionally acquired ADC data to attempt to corroborate our findings.


RESULTS
We found that patients who later exhibited PD exhibited a higher R2âˆ— within the CEL as well as a higher ratio of CEL to NEL. Our data correctly distinguished pseudoprogression from treatment effect in 9/9 patients, while ADC corrected identified 7/9 patients using an absolute ADC of 1200Â Ã—Â 10-6Â  mm2 /s.


CONCLUSIONS
Our method seems promising for the accurate identification of psPD, and the technique is amenable to evaluation in larger, multi-centre patient cohorts.",Australia,Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,29193849,2017,Apparent transverse relaxation (R2âˆ—) on MRI as a method to differentiate treatment effect (pseudoprogression) versus progressive disease in chemoradiation for malignant glioma.,n
1453,"BACKGROUND
Olfactory inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is associated with cytokines that may result in the death of olfactory sensory neurons. The principal signaling molecules involved in the apoptotic pathway are c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Although the JNK pathway has emerged as a key player in programmed cell death in neuroinflammation, its specific role in CRS-associated olfactory loss has not been thoroughly investigated.


METHODS
JNK activation was studied in human tissue samples from 9 control and 11 CRS patients by immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated c-Jun. A mouse model of inducible olfactory cytokine expression was used to experimentally control inflammation and assess JNK activation over time.


RESULTS
In patients with CRS, activation of c-Jun is significantly increased relative to non-CRS control subjects, and there is an associated loss of sensory neurons. In the olfactory inflammation mouse model, prolonged induction of inflammation results in elevation of c-Jun expression and neuronal apoptosis.


CONCLUSION
Activation of neuronal JNK is a feature of chronic olfactory inflammation that is associated with neuronal apoptosis. Given that inhibition of JNK activity is neuroprotective in other settings, antagonism of this pathway may have therapeutic potential in the management of inflammatory olfactory loss or other disorders linked to olfactory neuronal apoptosis.",United States,International forum of allergy & rhinology,29193850,2017,Olfactory loss in chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with neuronal activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase.,n

To study the morphology of human corneal nerves in eye bank organ-cultured corneas and in corneal grafts post-transplantation.


METHODS
Thirty-seven organ-cultured corneas were divided into: Group-A, anterior 300-400Â Î¼m of 20 corneas used for Descemets stripping endothelial keratoplasty, and Group-B, 17 full-thickness corneas unsuitable for transplantation. Corneas whole mounts were stained for nerves using acetylcholinesterase technique and examined by NanoZoomer digital pathology microscope. Central and sub-Bowman's stromal nerves and the sub-basal nerve plexus including perforation sites and terminal bulbs were studied. Ten eyes were imaged following penetrating keratoplasty using in-vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for the presence of sub-basal and stromal nerves at 1, 4-5 and 7-8Â weeks postoperatively (five eyes) and in all the other five eyes, the final follow-up was at 12Â weeks.


RESULTS
Fifteen of twenty (75%) corneas had stromal nerves in Group-A and 15 of 17 (88.2%) in Group-B. Average number of stromal nerves entering peripherally were 9.1 (range: 1-36). 7.5 in Group-A and 10.8 in Group-B. Central stromal nerves were seen in eight samples in Group-A and nine in Group-B. Many stromal nerves terminated abruptly without demonstrable continuity through Bowman's membrane. No terminal bulbs or sub-basal nerves were detected. In-vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) showed 4 of 5 in 9 of 10 (90%) donor corneas had stromal nerves 1Â week postoperatively, which remained present in 8 of 10 (80%) corneas at 4-5Â weeks and in 9 of 10 (90%) at 7-8Â weeks postoperatively. All 5 corneas analysed at 12Â weeks showed the same stromal nerves from 1 to 12Â weeks postoperatively. Sub-basal nerves were absent in all corneas over the 12-week study period.


CONCLUSION
This study provides further insight into the behaviour of corneal nerves in transplanted corneas. Corneal stromal nerves/nerve-sheaths are preserved in organ-cultured eye bank eyes and persist post-transplantation up to 3Â months. These could provide directional guidance to regenerating nerves from host stroma.",England,Acta ophthalmologica,29193851,2017,Survival of corneal nerve/sheath structures in organ-cultured donor corneas.,n

Due to several occult features of its life cycle, P. vivax threatens to be a problem for the recent efforts towards elimination of malaria globally. With an emphasis on malaria elimination goals, we summarize the major gaps in P. vivax diagnosis and describe how proteomics technologies have begun to contribute towards the discovery of antigens that could be used for various technology platforms and applications. We suggest areas where, in the future, proteomics technologies could fill in gaps in P. vivax diagnosis that have proved difficult. The discovery of new parasite antigens, host responses and immune signatures using proteomics technologies will be a key part of the global malaria elimination efforts.

We were prompted to conduct this study because of the strikingly positive results observed in the TNF-transgenic mouse model of RA in the repair of established bone erosions with the combination of an anti-TNF agent and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as compared with an anti-TNF agent alone.(1) This study demonstrated that the bone formation achieved with PTH was additive to the anti-resorptive effects of the anti-TNF agent.

1459,"Currently, the predominant hypothesis explains cellular differentiation and behaviour as an essentially genetically driven intracellular process, suggesting a gene-centrism paradigm. However, although many living species genetic has now been described, there is still a large gap between the genetic information interpretation and cell behaviour prediction. Indeed, the physical mechanisms underlying the cell differentiation and proliferation, which are now known or suspected to guide such as the flow of energy through cells and tissues, have been often overlooked. We thus here propose a complementary conceptual framework towards the development of an energy-oriented classification of cell properties, that is, a mitochondria-centrism hypothesis based on physical forces-driven principles. A literature review on the physical-biological interactions in a number of various biological processes is analysed from the point of view of the fluid and solid mechanics, electricity and thermodynamics. There is consistent evidence that physical forces control cell proliferation and differentiation. We propose that physical forces interfere with the cell metabolism mostly at the level of the mitochondria, which in turn control gene expression. The present perspective points towards a paradigm shift complement in biology.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193856,2017,Physical forces modulate cell differentiation and proliferation processes.,y

1461,"PURPOSE
To report a case of Exophiala phaeomuriformis mycotic keratitis in a patient from a subarctic climate region. Dematiaceous fungi (black yeasts) have been gaining importance as corneal keratitis and ulcer causative agents in certain regions, but no cases have been described in Scandinavia.


METHODS
Case report of a patient with a persistent corneal erosion that eventually presented a brown-pigmented infiltrate. The patient had a history of several months of topical therapy comprising medication for glaucoma, corticosteroids and antibiotics. A therapeutic contact lens was used, and amniotic membrane transplantation was performed before the development of the pigmented infiltrate.


RESULTS
Exophiala phaeomuriformis was identified on the microbiological cultures from the surgically obtained infiltrate scrapes. The patient responded to topical amphotericin and fluconazole, the erosion was cured and a stromal scar subsided. During follow-up, sequential slit-lamp images and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were obtained.


CONCLUSION
This is the first described case of keratitis caused by E.Â phaeomuriformis in a subarctic region, the first in Europe and, to our knowledge, the second reported case in the literature. It is important to remember that superficial corneal brown-pigmented infiltrates should raise the suspicion of an unusual fungal infection even in this climate.

1462,"AIM
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional cytokine with a wide range of actions, and plays a role in periodontal disease (PD) progression. Smoking significantly increases the risk for PD progression. Thus, aim of the present study was to estimate salivary HGF levels of non-smokers and smokers with chronic periodontitis (CP) and to compare its levels before and after therapy.


METHODS
A total of 75 participants were recruited and divided into three groups: group 1 included 25 healthy participants, group 2 included 25 non-smokers with CP, and group 3 included 25 smokers with CP. Salivary HGF levels were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and correlated with clinical parameters before and after treatment.


RESULTS
Salivary HGF levels of non-smokers and smokers with CP were significantly higher than the control group. There was a significant reduction in salivary HGF in smokers and non-smokers with CP after non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT).


CONCLUSION
Salivary HGF levels positively correlated with PD progression and smoking status. A significant reduction in HGF levels was seen after NSPT. Thus, within limits, it can be suggested that HGF plays a role in PD progression and can be used as a diagnostic biomarker to detect disease activity. Salivary HGF levels could also be useful to monitor response to periodontal therapy.",Australia,Journal of investigative and clinical dentistry,29193859,2017,Comparative evaluation of salivary hepatocyte growth factor in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis.,n
1463,"OBJECTIVES
To examine the effect of metabolic syndrome (Metsy) and psoriatic disease-related variables on coronary plaque burden in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.


METHODS
50 PsA patients without symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD) (25 with Metsy and 25 without (NMetsy)) and 50 age and sex-matched controls underwent 64-slice coronary CT angiographyÂ (CCTA). Plaque localisation, segment involvement score (SIS), stenosis severity score (SSS) and total plaque volume (TPV) were calculated. Plaques were classified as calcified (CP), mixed (MP) and non-calcified plaque (NCP). Kruskal-Wallis test, rank correlations and linear regression analyses were used to study the relationship between PsA, Metsy and plaque burden.


RESULTS
76% of PsA vs. 44% of controls had plaques (P=0.001) and the proportion of patients with affected coronary vessels was higher in PsA (P=0.007). SIS, SSS and TPV were greater in PsA compared to controls (P=0.003, P=0.001, P=<0.001; respectively). More PsA patients had MPs and MP volume was higher compared to controls (P=<0.001). PsA patients with Metsy had similar plaque burden and type to NMetsy. SIS, SSS and TPV did not show significant relationships with features of Metsy, but did significantly correlate with disease activity measures. TPV was associated with diagnosis of PsA (B=0.865, P=0.008), but not with Metsy. Age, CRP max, SJC max, disease duration, and plasma glucose were independent predictors of higher plaque burden in PsA.


CONCLUSIONS
PsA is associated with accelerated coronary plaque formation, particularly mixed plaques, independent of metabolic disease.

1464,"Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date there are limited options for treating this core symptomology. Treatments that stimulate adenosine A2A receptors may represent a promising approach for reducing RRBs in ASD. This is because A2A receptors are expressed on striatal neurons of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Under activation of this pathway has been associated with RRBs while activation of A2A receptors leads to increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway. The present studies investigated whether acute, systemic treatment with CGS21680, an A2A receptor agonist attenuates elevated self-grooming and a probabilistic reversal learning deficit in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf /J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism. The effects of this treatment were also investigated in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as a comparison strain. Using a spatial reversal learning test with 80/20 probabilistic feedback, comparable to one in which ASD individuals exhibit deficits, CGS 21680 (0.005 and 0.01mg/kg) attenuated a reversal learning deficit in BTBR mice. Enhancement in probabilistic reversal learning performance resulted from CGS 21680 improving the consistent maintenance of new adaptive behavioral choice patterns after reversal. CGS 21680 at 0.01 mg, but not 0.005 mg, also reduced self-grooming behavior in BTBR mice. CGS 21680 did not affect self-grooming or reversal learning in B6 mice. These findings demonstrate that A2A receptor agonists may be a promising receptor target in the treatment of RRBs in ASD. Autism Res 2017,.

1466,"Population responses to environmental extremes often dictate the bounds to species' distributions. However, population dynamics at, or near, those range limits may also be affected by sublethal effects. We exposed late instars and pupae of an invasive leafroller, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), to cold temperatures and measured the effects of exposure on subsequent survivorship, development, and reproduction. Cold temperature was applied as acute exposure to -10Â°C (a low, but not immediately lethal temperature for this species) or the onset of freezing (the peak of the supercooling point exotherm). Survival was defined as the ability to successfully eclose as an adult. We measured immature development times, pupal mass, and adult longevity as proxies of fitness in survivors. Additionally, surviving insects were mated with individuals that had not been exposed to cold to measure fertility. There was no difference between the proportion of larvae or pupae that survived acute exposure to -10Â°C and those exposed to the control temperature. Approximately 17% of larvae and 8% of pupae survived brief periods with internal ice formation and continued development to become reproductively-viable adults. Importantly, surviving the onset of freezing came with significant fitness costs but not to exposure to -10Â°C; most insects that survived partial freezing had lower fertility and shorter adult lifespans than either the -10Â°C or control group.

1468,"BACKGROUND
Prevalence of gastroschisis has been increasing in the United States (US) since 1980s. Genital infection with Chlamydia has also been increasing in prevalence, particularly among younger women. The etiology of gastroschisis is unknown. Ongoing research suggests multiple causal factors may be involved, including Chlamydia infection in mothers during pregnancy.


METHODS
Using birth certificate data from 2014 US vital records, we conducted a population-based case-control study to examine the association between prenatal Chlamydia exposure in young women (16-25 years of age) and gastroschisis in singleton offspring. Cases consisted of live births with gastroschisis, and controls had no major birth defects reported in their birth certificate. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (cOR and aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
There were 809 cases (95.6% were isolated cases) and 1,260,293 controls. Chlamydia during pregnancy was reported in 4.5% of case and 3.6% control mothers (pâ€‰=â€‰.21). Case mothers were significantly more likely to be younger (16-20 years of age) at the time of delivery compared to control mothers (pâ€‰<â€‰.0001). We found no significant association between Chlamydia infection during pregnancy and gastroschisis (cORâ€‰=â€‰1.24; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.89-1.73 and aORâ€‰=â€‰1.06; 95% CI: 0.66-1.70).


CONCLUSION
With the caveat of possible misclassification of exposure and outcome variables in birth certificate data, we found no significant association between prenatal exposure to Chlamydia and gastroschisis in the offspring born to younger mothers.

1470,"BACKGROUND
Combination medicines including an artemisinin are the mainstay of antimalarial therapy. Artemisinins are potent embryotoxicants in animal species due to their trioxane moiety.


METHODS
As part of its development, the new synthetic trioxolane antimalarial artefenomel (OZ439) was tested in rat whole embryo culture and in rat embryo-fetal toxicity studies with dosing throughout organogenesis or with a single dose on Gestational Day (GD) 12. The single-dose studies included groups treated with artesunate to allow a direct comparison of the embryotoxicity of the two antimalarials and included toxicokinetics hematology and histological examination of embryos. In addition, the distribution of artefenomel-related material in plasma was determined after the administration of 14 C-artefenomel.


RESULTS
Artefenomel and artesunate showed similar patterns of embryotoxicity including cardiovascular defects and resorption with a steep dose-response. They both also caused a depletion of circulating embryonic erythroblasts both in vitro and in vivo and decreases in maternal reticulocyte count. However, artefenomel was âˆ¼250-fold less potent than the active metabolite of artesunate (dihydroartemisinin) as an embryotoxicant in vitro. The safety margin (based on AUC) for artefenomel administered on GD 12 was approximately 100-fold greater than that for artesunate. Also, unlike artesunate, artefenomel was not a selective developmental toxicant.


CONCLUSIONS
The lesser embryotoxicity of artefenomel is likely linked to its original design which included two blocking side groups that had been introduced to lower the reactivity with ferrous iron. Our data support the hypothesis that artefenomel's improved safety margin is linked to a lower potential for inhibiting heme biosynthesis in embryonic erythroblasts.",United States,Birth defects research,29193867,2017,Improved safety margin for embryotoxicity in rats for the new endoperoxide artefenomel (OZ439) as compared to artesunate.,n
1471,"Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae (Xap) causing bacterial blight is an important pathogen that incurs significant losses to the exportability of pomegranate. Xap employs Xop TTSS-effector via type three secretion system to suppress pomegranate immunity. Here, we investigate the role of XopL during blight pathogenesis. We found that XopL is essential for its in planta growth and full virulence. Leaves inoculated with Xap Î”xopL produced restricted water-soaked lesions compared to that inoculated with Xap wild. XopL supports Xap for its sustained multiplication in pomegranate by suppressing plant cell death (PCD) event.

RT-qPCR analysis revealed that immune responsive genes were upregulated when challenged with Xap Î”xopL, while up-regulation of such genes was compromised in the complemented strain containing xopL gene. The transiently expressed XopL::EYFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane, indicating the possible site of its action.

1472,"OBJECTIVE
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a genetically complex disease of immune dysregulation. Seeking insight into genetic risk mechanisms, we conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of confirmed genetic risk loci in CD4+ T cells and B cells from carefully phenotyped early arthritis patients naÃ¯ve to therapeutic immunomodulation.


METHODS
344 patients donated RNA and DNA from purified B and/or CD4+ T-cells. Genotyping and global gene expression measurement were carried out using Illumina BeadChip microarrays. Variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with non-HLA RA- SNPs (r2 >0.8) were analysed, seeking evidence of cis- or trans- eQTLs according to whether associated probes were or were not within 4MB of these LD blocks.


RESULTS
Genes subject to cis eQTL effects common to both CD4+ and B-lymphocytes at RA risk loci were FADS1, FADS2, BLK, FCRL3, ORMDL3, PPIL3 and GSDMB. By contrast, those acting on METTL21B, JAZF1, IKZF3, and PADI4 were unique to CD4+ lymphocytes, the latter being identified for the first time in this cell subset. We also found B-lymphocyte-specific eQTLs for SYNGR1 and CD83. At the 8p23 BLK-FAM167A locus, adjacent genes were subject to eQTLs whose activity differed markedly between cell types, the FAM167A effect displaying striking B-lymphocyte specificity. No trans eQTLs approached experiment-wide significance, and linear modelling did not identify a significant influence of biological co-variates upon cis eQTL effect sizes.

1473,"Microaerobic (oxygen limited) conditions are advantageous for several industrial applications since a majority of the carbon atoms can be directed for synthesis of desired products. Oxygen limited conditions, however, can result in high levels of undesirable by-products such as acetate which subsequently can have an impact on biomass and product yields. The molecular mechanisms involved in acetate accumulation under oxygen limited conditions are not well understood. Our results indicate that a majority of the genetic modifications known to decrease acetate under aerobic conditions results in similar or even higher acetate under oxygen limitation. Deletion of arcA, whose gene product is a global transcriptional regulator, was the only modification among those evaluated that significantly decreased acetate under both transient and prolonged oxygen limitation. Transcriptome results indicate that the arcA deletion results in an increased expression of the operon involving acs and actP (whose gene products are involved in acetate assimilation and uptake respectively) and some genes in the TCA cycle, thereby promoting increased acetate assimilation. These results provide useful cues for strain design for improved manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals under oxygen limited conditions. This article is protected by copyright.

These interactions are crucial for the development of the stem cells niche to determine stem cell shape. The ECM is considered as a natural niche for cell residence. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) enable cell-cell interactions and the interactions between the cell and ECM via various mechanisms, such as trans-interaction and the heterophilic interactions. These interactions promote a broad spectrum of cell signaling that directly or indirectly modulates stem cell proliferation, self-renewal property, adhesion, and multilineage differentiation.

Here, a factorial design was used to investigate the singular and combinational effects of flow, dissolved oxygen concentration (D.O.) and pulsation on whole mechanically-disrupted rat pancreata in a perfusion bioreactor. Whole rat pancreata were cultured for 72h under defined bioreactor process conditions. Secreted insulin was measured and histological (haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)) as well as immunofluorescent insulin staining were performed and quantified. The combination of flow and D.O. had the most significant effect on secreted insulin at 5h and 24h. The D.O. had the biggest effect on tissue histological quality, and pulsation had the biggest effect on the number of insulin-positive structures. Based on the factorial design analysis, bioreactor conditions using high flow, low D.O. and pulsation were selected to further study glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Here, mechanically-disrupted rat pancreata were cultured for 24h under these bioreactor conditions and were then challenged with high glucose concentration for 6h and high glucoseâ€‰+â€‰IBMX (an insulin secretagogue) for a further 6h.

1478,"PURPOSE
Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a vitreoretinal disorder in which retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell activation contributes to both formation of fibrotic retinal membranes and inflammation. Vitreous of patients with PVR contains increased thrombin activity which induces profibrotic and proinflammatory programs in RPE cells. Inhibition of intravitreal thrombin activity may thus represent a therapeutic option for PVR. In this study, we examined the capacity of the clinically available directÂ thrombin inhibitor dabigatran to inhibit thrombin activity in vitreous fluids.


METHODS
ARPE-19 cells were cultured with the following: (i) thrombin, (ii) vitreous without thrombin activity and (iii) vitreous with elevated thrombinÂ activity (PVR samples and thrombin spiked vitreous) either in the presence or absence of dabigatran (range: 10-5 to 10-7 Â M). Subsequently, CCL2, CXCL8, GMCSF, IL6 and PDGFB mRNA expression levels were determined by RQ-PCR and protein levels of 27 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were detected in culture supernatants using a multiplex approach. In addition, the capacity of vitreous fluids obtained from patientsÂ after oral dabigatran intake was tested in an inÂ vitro thrombin activity assay.


RESULTS
Thrombin and vitreous fluids containing thrombin activity induced CCL2, CXCL8, GM-CSF, IL-6 and PDGF-BB expression by ARPE-19 cells, which was inhibited by dabigatran. In addition, dabigatran that reached the vitreous after repeated oral intake did inhibit thrombin activity in the inÂ vitro activity assay.


CONCLUSION
Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is associated with increased intravitreal thrombin activity that activates profibrotic and proinflammatory pathways in RPE cells.

To assess the effects of probiotics on serum ghrelin levels and protection for lungs in children with acute lung injury (ALI).


METHODS
This study was performed as a double-blind, randomized, and controlled trial in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The eligible children with ALI were assigned to either probiotic treatment or an identical placebo for 10 days. Serum ghrelin, SP-A(surfactant protein-A), TNF-Î±, and IL-6 concentrations were assessed at baseline and at the end of trial. Meanwhile, pulmonary function test and echocardiography were examined, then VPEF (volume to peak tidal expiratory flow), TPEF/TE (the ratio of time taken to reach peak expiratory flow to total expiratory time), MAP (mean arterial pressure), and PAP (pulmonary artery pressure) were recorded.


RESULTS
Eighty participants fulfilled the study requirements with 40 children for each group. The groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. Serum SP-A, TNF-Î±, and IL-6 levels in the probiotic group were 212.6â€‰Â±â€‰52.9â€‰ng/mL, 401.9â€‰Â±â€‰56.4â€‰pg/mL, and 245.1â€‰Â±â€‰55.1â€‰pg/mL on day 10, respectively, significantly lower levels compared to the control group where the same parameters were 248.2â€‰Â±â€‰57â€‰ng/mL, 449.4â€‰Â±â€‰60.1â€‰pg/mL, and 308.3â€‰Â±â€‰92.2â€‰pg/mL (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). However, ghrelin concentrations were elevated in the intervention group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). On measurement of pulmonary function, the probiotic group demonstrated a VPEF of 26.1â€‰Â±â€‰4.2â€‰mL and TPEF/TE of 29.1â€‰Â±â€‰4.7%, which were higher than the control group (24.7â€‰Â±â€‰4.3â€‰mL and 26.9â€‰Â±â€‰4.7%, respectively) (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). MAP and PAP also improved in the probiotic group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Furthermore, ghrelin, SP-A, TNF-Î±, IL-6, and PAP were negatively correlated. Positive correlations were found between ghrelin, TPEF/TE, and MAP. There were no probiotic-associated adverse events during the observation.


CONCLUSION
Probiotics administrated to children with ALI alleviates the inflammation of lungs, improves pulmonary function and circulation by ghrelin.",United States,Pediatric pulmonology,29193877,2017,"Effects of probiotics on ghrelin and lungs in children with acute lung injury: A double-blind randomized, controlled trial.",n
1481,"One of the limiting factors in tissue regeneration, particularly in the context of chronic disease such as myodystrophy, motor neuron disease, sarcopenia and cardiovascular disease, is limited availability of stem cells. We propose employing autologous macrophages to deliver stem cells, thereby facilitating tissue regeneration, by a novel and relatively non-invasive therapeutic intervention. Circulatory monocytic cells of M1 phenotype have capacity for transendothelial migration to infiltrate damaged tissue, making them ideal delivery vehicles. However, in order to deliver viable stem cells these macrophages must undergo phagosome maturation arrest. Our aim was to induce phagosome maturation arrest in pre-polarised M1 macrophages, whilst maintaining capacity for phagocytic engulfment (including phagosome formation) and transendothelial migration. Primary human M1 macrophages were treated with a Wortmannin-Concanamycin A-Chloroquine cocktail to induce arrest. Modified cells were allowed to ingest 4.5Î¼m protein-coated fluorescent latex beads (simulated stem cells), before migratory capacity in response to MCP-1 was assessed over a 2-hour period in a Transwell co-culture system. Data indicate that phagosome acidification (as indicated by pHrodoÂ®) was prevented in treated cells, effectively limiting digestion of ingested ""cargo"" (1.23Â±0.26% vs. 7.52Â±0.98% in controls; p<0.0001). Neither phagocytic engulfment capacity (68.67Â±3.51% vs. 61.19Â±4.68%), nor migratory capacity (70.14Â±12.6 vs. 72.86Â±16.0 migrated cells per well) was compromised. We conclude that macrophages were successfully modified into transendothelial delivery vehicles, without compromising required functionality.

1482,"About 15 years ago, bioprinting was coined as one of the ultimate solutions to engineer vascularized tissues, which was impossible to accomplish using the conventional tissue fabrication approaches. With the advances of 3D-printing technology during the past decades, one may expect 3D bioprinting being developed as much as 3D printing. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The printing principles of bioprinting are dramatically different from those applied in industrialized 3D printing, as they have to take the living components into account. While the conventional 3D-printing technologies are actually applied for biological or biomedical applications, true 3D bioprinting involving direct printing of cells and other biological substances for tissue reconstruction is still in its infancy. In this progress report, the current status of bioprinting in academia and industry is subjectively evaluated. The progress made is acknowledged, and the existing bottlenecks in bioprinting are discussed. Recent breakthroughs from a variety of associated fields, including mechanical engineering, robotic engineering, computing engineering, chemistry, material science, cellular biology, molecular biology, system control, and medicine may overcome some of these current bottlenecks.

However, M1 was reported to selectively accumulate in liver and transform to fatty acid esters. Ester of M1 was not excreted by bile as M1 was, which means it was accumulated in the liver longer than M1. The present study reported a synthetic method of M1-O, a mono octyl ester of M1, and evaluated the anticancer property against murine H22 cell both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, both M1 and M1-O showed a dose-dependent manner in cytotoxicity assay in vitro. At lower dose of 12.5 Î¼M, M1-O showed moderate detoxification. Instead, M1-O exhibited significantly higher inhibition in H22-bearing mice than M1. M1-O induced murine H22 tumor cellular apoptosis in caspase-dependent pathway given that pan caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK could reverse the cytotoxicity induced by M1-O. Additionally, pro-and anti-apoptosis proteins, Bcl-2 and Bax altered and consequently induced increased expression of cleaved caspased-3. Interestingly, cyclophosphamide regimen significantly induced atrophy of spleen and thymus, main immune organs, while M1-O treatment greatly alleviated this atrophy.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, burdensome disease requiring complex knowledge to manage the disease. Significant gaps in knowledge have been documented for parents, which may lead to unintentionally poor adherence and insufficient transfer of treatment responsibility from parents to adolescents. There are no current, validated measures of parent knowledge for this population and there are no measures that assess the knowledge required for day-to-day behavioral management of CF. We assessed the psychometric properties of the parent version of the Knowledge of Disease Management-Cystic Fibrosis measure (KDM-CF-P) using data from iCARE (I Change Adherence and Raise Expectations), a randomized control adherence intervention trial.


METHODS
A total of 196 parents in the iCARE standard care/control arm completed 35 items assessing their knowledge of disease management at their 12-month study visit, prior to beginning the intervention. Items were eliminated from the measure if they met the threshold for ceiling effects, were deemed clinically irrelevant, or did not correlate well with their intended scale. Item-to-total correlations, confirmatory factor analysis, discriminant function, reliability, and convergent validity were calculated.


RESULTS
The KDM-CF-P (19 items) demonstrated internal consistency of KR20â€‰=â€‰0.60 on each scale and a two-scale structure. Convergent validity for knowledge scores was found with maternal education, family income, and type of medical insurance. Parents correctly answered approximately 85% of items on the KDM-CF-P.


CONCLUSIONS
The KDM-CF-P psychometrics support a two-scale measure with clinical utility.

Giant cell tumors (GCTs), both osseous and extraosseous, are benign tumors that occur, albeit rarely, in the head and neck region. Extraosseous GCTs may be further classified based on their tissue of origin and specific anatomic location. Regardless of location, giant cell tumors are morphologically similar and share cytologic and histologic diagnostic criteria. Evaluation of imaging is therefore essential to the correct classification of these tumors. Accurate diagnosis is crucial since the clinical behavior and treatment is significantly different among the subtypes of GCTs.

Little is known about the long-term costs of lupus nephritis (LN). These were compared between patients with and without LN based on multistate modelling.


METHODS
Patients from 32 centres in 11 countries were enrolled in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) inception cohort within 15 months of diagnosis and provided annual data on renal function, hospitalizations, medications, dialysis, and selected procedures. LN was diagnosed by renal biopsy or the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Renal function was assessed annually using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or proteinuria (ePrU). A multistate model was used to predict 10-year cumulative costs by multiplying annual costs associated with each renal state by the expected state duration.


RESULTS
1,545 patients participated, 89.3% female, mean age at diagnosis 35.2 years (SD 13.4), 49.0% Caucasian, and mean follow up 6.3 years (SD 3.3). LN developed in 39.4% by the end of follow up. Ten-year cumulative costs were greater in those with LN and an eGFR < 30 ml/min ($310 579 2015 Canadian dollars versus $19 987 if no LN and eGFR > 60 ml/min) or with LN and ePrU > 3 g/d ($84 040 versus $20 499 if no LN and ePrU < 0.25 g/d).


CONCLUSION
Patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min incurred 10-year costs 15-fold higher than those with normal eGFR. By estimating the expected duration in each renal state and incorporating associated annual costs, disease severity at presentation can be used to anticipate future healthcare costs.

Using modified sonourethrography (mSUG) with retrograde jelly injection to precisely measure the morphological characteristics of the prostatic urethra, we assessed prostatic urethral morphology associated with clinical parameters of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).


METHODS
BPH patients (nâ€‰=â€‰43) and control patients with localized prostate cancer (PC; nâ€‰=â€‰57) were imaged by mSUG before surgery. Using the seminal colliculus as a landmark, prostatic urethral angulation (PUA), sagittal urethral diameter, and anterior or posterior prostatic urethral length were measured. The International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) was also evaluated in all patients. The Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index (BOOI) was measured in BPH patients that could void in a pressure-flow study. Parameters were compared between BPH and PC patients, and correlations among morphological and clinical parameters were evaluated.


RESULTS
Prostatic urethras were clearly observed in all patients by mSUG. PUA, sagittal urethral diameter, and posterior urethral length were all greater in BPH than PC patients (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Among all parameters examined, PUA had the strongest correlation with IPSS (râ€‰=â€‰0.56). Longitudinal urethral diameter showed the strongest correlation with BOOI, whereas PUA was not correlated with BOOI.


CONCLUSIONS
Prostatic urethral morphology can be imaged precisely by mSUG. Morphometric measurements showed that increased PUA was strongly correlated with problematic urinary symptoms, and a flattened shape of the posterior urethra, such as extension of the sagittal urethral diameter, was correlated with urinary tract obstruction by BPH.",Australia,Lower urinary tract symptoms,29193884,2017,Morphological and clinical evaluation of prostatic urethra using modified sonourethrography with retrograde jelly injection.,n

Herein, we present an alternative approach, named AquaMMapS, that provides a three-dimensional sampling of putative hydration sites. Interestingly, AquaMMapS can post-inspect molecular dynamics trajectories obtained from different molecular dynamics engines and using indifferently crystallographic or docking-driven structures as a starting point. Moreover, AquaMMapS is naturally integrated to supervised molecular dynamics (SuMD) simulations Finally, a penalty scoring method, named AquaMMapScoring,(AMS), has been developed to evaluate, during the binding event, the number and the nature of the water molecules displaced by a ligand approaching its binding site, guiding a medicinal chemist to explore the most suitable regions of a ligand that can be decorated either with or without interfering with the interaction networks mediated by water molecules with specific recognition regions of the protein.",Germany,ChemMedChem,29193885,2017,AquaMMapS: an alternative tool to monitor the role of water molecules during protein-ligand association.,n

This study assessed the association between severe NVP and the risk of NTD in offspring compared with a population and a malformed control group. We also assessed whether folic acid supplements modified this association.


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
A case-control study was conducted with subjects enrolled from June 19, 2002, to November 18, 2014, from a population-based birth defects surveillance system that monitors major external structural birth defects through active case ascertainment in Shanxi Province, China. The main comparison was between women with NTD-affected offspring who experienced NVP in early pregnancy versus those who did not. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between severe NVP and the risk of NTD while adjusting for potential confounding factors. The risk was estimated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).


RESULTS
The adjusted OR (AOR) of severe NVP for NTDs was 3.25 (95%CI 2.56, 4.12) compared with the population control, and 1.65 (95%CI 1.00, 2.72) compared with the malformed controls. When stratified by intake of folic acid supplements, the AOR for severe NVP was 3.40 (95%CI 2.61, 4.42) in the non-intake of folic acid supplements stratum and 2.51 (95%CI 1.42, 4.43) in the intake of folic acid supplements stratum.

1490,"We built a whole-body computational model to study the role of the poorly understood vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165b splice isoform in peripheral artery disease (PAD). This model was built and validated using published and new experimental data from cells, mice, and humans, and explicitly accounts for known properties of VEGF165b : lack of extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding and weak phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in vitro. The resulting model captures all known information about VEGF165b distribution and signaling in human PAD, and provides novel, nonintuitive insight into VEGF165b mechanism of action in vivo. Although VEGF165a and VEGF165b compete for VEGFR2 in vitro, simulations show that these isoforms do not compete for VEGFR2 at much lower physiological concentrations. Instead, reduced VEGF165a may drive impaired VEGFR2 signaling. The model predicts that VEGF165b does compete for binding to VEGFR1, supporting a VEGFR1-mediated response to anti-VEGF165b .

Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) has the highest case-specific mortality of any rheumatic disease and has no effective therapy. A clear manifestation of SSc is the presence of auto-antibodies. However, the origin of autoantibody-producing B lymphocytes and mechanisms of their activation, auto-antibody production and role remain unclear.


OBJECTIVE
To identify mechanisms that contribute to pathogenic B cell generation, involvement in SSc and assess the altered distribution and function of B cells in patients.


METHODS
Multi-colour flow cytometry was used to determine B cell subset distribution, cytokine production and tolerance induction in SSc patients and healthy controls. Cytokine production following stimulation of the cells ex vivo was carried out by multiplex analysis.


RESULTS
The study reveals a range of defects in B lymphocyte tolerance and cytokine production in SSc. Evidence is provided for altered distribution of transitional B cell subsets, increased production of IL-6 and IL-8 and defective tolerance induction in SSc B cells. In addition, the study reveals that B cells in SSc have a reduced ability to produce IL-10 when stimulated through innate immune pathways. In contrast to healthy individuals, tolerance checkpoints in SSc patients fail to suppress the emergence of B cells that produce autoantibodies with specificity to the Scl-70 antigen, a specificity strongly associated with SSc. These defects are paralleled by altered intracellular signalling and apoptosis following B cell receptor (BCR) engagement.

While systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) disproportionately affect females, prior studies suggest that males may experience poorer outcomes. We investigated sex differences in healthcare utilization, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality among patients with LN receiving Medicaid, public insurance for low-income individuals.


METHODS
Within Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) from 29 states (2000-2010), we used billing claims to identify individuals 5-65 years with incident LN (PPV 80%). MAX data were linked to the US Renal Data System to determine ESRD, and to Social Security Death Index files to determine death. We estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) by sex for healthcare utilization using Poisson regression and used multivariable proportional hazards models to compare risks of ESRD and death by sex.


RESULTS
Of 2750 patients with incident LN, 283 (10%) were male. Mean follow-up was 3.1 (SD 2.3). Mean age was 25 (SD 14) years among males; 30 (SD 14) among females (p<0.01). Males had fewer outpatient (IRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97) and emergency department visits (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.90). The 5-year cumulative incidence of ESRD was 22.3% in males, 21.2% in females and of death, 9.4% in males, 9.8% in females.

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) produce key synovial fluid and tissue components to ensure joint integrity under healthy conditions, whereas they become cancer-like and aggressively contribute to joint degeneration in inflammatory arthritis. Here we asked whether the SOXC transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11, whose functions are critical in joint development and many cancer types, contribute to FLS activities under normal and inflammatory conditions.


METHODS
We inactivated the SOXC genes in FLS of adult mice and studied consequences on joint homeostasis and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±)-induced arthritis. We used primary cells and synovial biopsies from arthritis patients to analyze the interactions between inflammatory signals and SOXC proteins.


RESULTS
Postnatal inactivation of the SOXC genes had no major consequence on joint integrity in otherwise healthy mice. However, it hampered synovial hyperplasia and joint degeneration in transgenic mice expressing human TNFÎ±. These effects were explained by the ability of SOX4/11 to amplify the pathogenic impact of TNFÎ± on FLS aggressiveness, including increased cell survival and migration. SOXC RNA levels were unchanged by TNFÎ± and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, but their proteins were strongly stabilized and able to potentiate the TNFÎ±-induced upregulation of genes involved in FLS transformation. Substantiating the human disease relevance of these findings, the SOXC protein, but not RNA levels, were significantly higher in inflamed than non-inflamed synovium from arthritic patients.


CONCLUSION
SOXC proteins are targets and pivotal mediators of pro-inflammatory cytokines during FLS transformation in arthritic diseases. Their targeting could thus improve current strategies to treat these and possibly other inflammatory diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

OFD1 syndrome is a rare ciliopathy inherited on a dominant X-linked mode, typically lethal in males in the first or second trimester of pregnancy. It is characterized by oral cavity and digital anomalies possibly associated with cerebral and renal signs. Its prevalence is between 1/250,000 and 1/50,000 births. It is due to heterozygous mutations of OFD1 and mutations are often de novo (75%). Familial forms show highly variable phenotypic expression. OFD1 encodes a protein involved in centriole growth, distal appendix formation, and ciliogenesis.


CASES
We report the investigation of three female fetuses in which corpus callosum agenesis was detected by ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy. In all three fetuses, fetopathological examination allowed the diagnosis of OFD1 syndrome, which was confirmed by molecular analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, these are the first case reports of antenatal diagnosis of OFD1 syndrome in the absence of familial history, revealed following detection of agenesis of the corpus callosum.

To assess the use of Cochrane Reviews to inform the medical policy documents of major US private payers.


METHODS
The publically available drug policy documents of the five major US private payers (covering about 50% market) namely: Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, Humana and United Healthcare (UHC) were assessed in February 2017 and reviewed to find whether they had used Cochrane Reviews. We extracted information such as use of Cochrane Reviews, number of Cochrane Reviews used, context of use and impact of Cochrane Reviews on policy, and Cochrane Review Group (CRG) and Cochrane Center linked to the Cochrane Review.

Among the selected payers, less than half of the policy documents used Cochrane Reviews: maximum for Aetna (52%) and minimum for Humana (2%). Three hundred and sixty-one Cochrane Reviews from 42 CRGs have been used to inform 118 drug policy documents: Aetna (221) Anthem (64), Cigna (30), and UHC (25). The highest number of reviews used from any Cochrane Center was 79 (UK). The most reviews used from any CRG were 27 (Musculoskeletal Group). The most reviews used to inform any one policy was 18 (Drug: Botulinum Toxin, Payer: Aetna). Overall, 66% of the Cochrane Reviews were used to inform the background section of the policy document and 34% supported the clinical usage of the drug. Furthermore, 42% of the reviews had cited inline in the policies they were used to inform.


CONCLUSION
Cochrane Reviews are used to inform the US healthcare payers' policies, but there is still scope to encourage the further usage of Cochrane Reviews in healthcare decision making.",England,Journal of evidence-based medicine,29193899,2017,Role of Cochrane Reviews in informing US private payers' policies.,n
1504,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
Gallstones and its complications are one of the most common hepatobiliary tract diseases. Several epidemiologic studies have suggested that patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection might be at an increased risk of gallstones. However, the data on this relationship remain inconclusive. This meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to summarize all available evidence.


METHODS
A literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to May 2016. Studies that reported relative risks, odd ratios, or hazard ratios comparing the risk of gallstones among HCV-infected patients versus subjects without HCV infection were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method.


RESULTS
Eleven studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The pooled OR of gallstones in HCV-infected patients versus subjects without HCV infection was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 2.48, I2Â  =Â 89%). Subgroup analysis showed that significant risk was increased for both male (pooled OR of 2.07, 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.76) and female (pooled OR of 3.00, 95% CI, 2.16 to 4.17).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrated a significantly increased risk of gallstones among HCV-infected patients. Further studies are required to clarify how this risk should be addressed in the clinical picture.",England,Journal of evidence-based medicine,29193901,2017,Hepatitis C virus infection and risk of gallstones: A meta-analysis.,n
1505,"Production of knob and hole dual light chain bispecific antibodies poses several unique challenges for development of a feasible industrial scale manufacturing process. We developed an efficient process for the assembly and purification of knob and hole dual light chain bispecific antibodies. Two distinct half-antibodies targeting two different antigens were expressed separately in E. coli cells and captured independently using Protein A chromatography. When combined, the knob and hole mutations in the CH3 domains promoted heterodimer formation. The hinge region disulfides were reduced and re-oxidized to form the disulfide bridge between the two complementary half antibodies. Unreacted half antibodies, non-covalently linked homodimers, covalently linked homodimers, and non-covalently linked heterodimers are impurities closely related to the product of interest and are challenging to remove by standard processes. Characterization of the molecular properties of the half antibodies and high-throughput screening predicted column chromatography performance and allowed for rapid development of downstream purification steps for removal of unique product-related and process-related impurities.

1506,"Thalidomide is a drug used worldwide for several indications, but the molecular mechanisms of its teratogenic property are not fully understood. Studies in animal models suggest the oxidative stress, the inhibition of angiogenesis, and the binding to E3-ubiquitin ligase complex as mechanisms by which thalidomide can change the expression of genes important to embryonic development. In this study, seven polymorphisms in genes related to development (FGF8, FGF10, BMP4, SHH, TP53, TP63, and TP73) were analyzed in people with thalidomide embryopathy (TE) and compared to people without malformations. The sample consisted of 36 people with TE and 135 unrelated and nonsyndromic people who had their DNA genotyped by PCR real-time. Although no allelic or genotypic differences were observed between the groups, we hypothesized that other regions in these genes and related genes may play an important role in thalidomide teratogenesis, which is known to have a genetic contribution. Identifying such molecular mechanisms is essential for the development of a molecule that will be analogue to thalidomide but safe enough to avoid the emergence of new cases of TE.",United States,Birth defects research,29193903,2017,Genetic susceptibility to thalidomide embryopathy in humans: Study of candidate development genes.,n

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disorder characterized by congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. Patients harboring X-linked FANCB pathogenic variants usually present with severe congenital malformations resembling VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus.


METHODS
We employed the diepoxybutane (DEB) test for FA diagnosis, arrayCGH for detection of duplication, targeted capture and next-gen sequencing for defining the duplication breakpoint, PacBio sequencing of full-length FANCB aberrant transcript, FANCD2 ubiquitination and foci formation assays for the evaluation of FANCB protein function by viral transduction of FANCB-null cells with lentiviral FANCB WT and mutant expression constructs, and droplet digital PCR for quantitation of the duplication in the genomic DNA and cDNA.


RESULTS
We describe here an FA-B patient with a mild phenotype. The DEB diagnostic test for FA revealed somatic mosaicism. We identified a 9154Â bp intragenic duplication in FANCB, covering the first coding exon 3 and the flanking regions. A four bp homology (GTAG) present at both ends of the breakpoint is consistent with microhomology-mediated duplication mechanism. The duplicated allele gives rise to an aberrant transcript containing exon 3 duplication, predicted to introduce a stop codon in FANCB protein (p.A319*). Duplication levels in the peripheral blood DNA declined from 93% to 7.9% in the span of eleven years. Moreover, the patient fibroblasts have shown 8% of wild-type (WT) allele and his carrier mother showed higher than expected levels of WT allele (79% vs. 50%) in peripheral blood, suggesting that the duplication was highly unstable.


CONCLUSION
Unlike sequence point variants, intragenic duplications are difficult to precisely define, accurately quantify, and may be very unstable, challenging the proper diagnosis. The reversion of genomic duplication to the WT allele results in somatic mosaicism and may explain the relatively milder phenotype displayed by the FA-B patient described here.",United States,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,29193904,2017,Somatic mosaicism of an intragenic FANCB duplication in both fibroblast and peripheral blood cells observed in a Fanconi anemia patient leads to milder phenotype.,n

Some miRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in tissue, while others are tissue-specific or tissue-enriched. miRNAs can be released by cells and are found in various biofluids, including serum and plasma. Thus, measuring miRNAs in the circulation may provide information on the originating tissue or cells. MyomiRs are described as striated muscle-specific or muscle-enriched miRNAs. Their circulating levels can be measured and have been proposed to be new biomarkers of physiological and pathological muscle processes. The aims of this review are to summarize the current knowledge of circulating myomiRs, to identify the types of information they can provide about skeletal muscle, and to determine how to apply that information in the fields of research and medicine.",Germany,"Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",29193905,2017,Circulating myomiRs: a new class of biomarkers to monitor skeletal muscle in physiology and medicine.,n

The method is a modification of a recently published protocol for Luspatercept (ACE-536, ACVR2B-Fc), another erythropoiesis stimulating fusion protein. Out of 27 tested antibodies against either the extracellular domain of ACVR2A or the full length protein, only 4 antibodies bound strongly enough to Sotatercept for usage with immunoprecipitation followed by SAR-PAGE and Western single blotting. The adapted protocol allows the detection of 0.1 ng/mL Sotatercept in just 50 Î¼L human serum. None of the three commercial ACVR2-ELISAs was able to detect Sotatercept and the two tested surrogate proteins even in the Î¼g/mL range. As for Luspatercept, only IPG-IEF/2D-PAGE generated discrete isoforms. Due to the long serum half-life, the SAR-PAGE method will be able to detect Sotatercept for several weeks and will be very useful in doping testing.",England,Drug testing and analysis,29193906,2017,Detection of Sotatercept (ACE-011) in human serum by SAR-PAGE and Western Single Blotting.,n

1511,"BACKGROUND
Both epidemiological and animal studies have previously indicated a link between in utero radiation exposure and birth defects such as microphthalmos, anophthalmos, and exencephaly. However, detailed knowledge on embryonic radiosensitivity during different stages of neurulation is limited, especially in terms of neural tube defect and eye defect development.


METHODS
To assess the most radiosensitive stage during neurulation, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were X-irradiated (0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy) at embryonic days (E)7, E7.5, E8, E8.5, or E9. Next, the fetuses were scored macroscopically for various defects and prenatal resorptions/deaths were counted. In addition, cranial skeletal development was ascertained using the alcian-alizarin method. Furthermore, postnatal/young adult survival was followed until 5 weeks (W5) of age, after X-irradiation at E7.5 (0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy, or 1.0 Gy). In addition, body and brain weights were registered at adult age (W10) following X-ray exposure at E7.5 (0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy).


RESULTS
Several malformations, including microphthalmos and exencephaly, were most evident after irradiation at E7.5, with significance starting respectively at 0.5 Gy and 1.0 Gy. Prenatal mortality and weight were significantly affected in all irradiated groups. Long-term follow-up of E7.5 irradiated animals revealed a reduction in survival at 5 weeks of age after high dose exposure (1.0 Gy), while lower doses (0.5 Gy, 0.1 Gy) did not affect brain and body weight at postnatal week 10.


CONCLUSIONS
With this study, we gained more insight in radiosensitivity throughout neurulation, and offered a better defined model to further study radiation-induced malformations and the underlying mechanisms.",United States,Birth defects research,29193908,2017,A detailed characterization of congenital defects and mortality following moderate X-ray doses during neurulation.,n
1512,"The initial host response to healthcare materials' surfaces after implantation is the adsorption of proteins from blood and interstitial fluids. This adsorbed protein layer modulates the biological/cellular responses to healthcare materials. This stresses the significance of the surface protein assembly for the biocompatibility and functionality of biomaterials and necessitates a profound fundamental understanding of the capability to control protein-surface interactions. This review, therefore, addresses this by systematically analyzing and discussing strategies to control protein adsorption on polymeric healthcare materials through the introduction of specific surface nanostructures. Relevant proteins, healthcare materials' surface properties, clinical applications of polymer healthcare materials, fabrication methods for nanostructured polymer surfaces, amorphous, semicrystalline and block copolymers are considered with a special emphasis on the topographical control of protein adsorption. The review shows that nanostructured polymer surfaces are powerful tools to control the amount, orientation, and order of adsorbed protein layers. It also shows that the understanding of the biological responses to such ordered protein adsorption is still in its infancy, yet it has immense potential for future healthcare materials. The review, which is-as far as it is known-the first one discussing protein adsorption on nanostructured polymer surfaces, concludes with highlighting important current research questions.",Germany,Advanced healthcare materials,29193909,2017,Controlling Protein Adsorption through Nanostructured Polymeric Surfaces.,n

The noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary carcinoma (nEFVPTC) has recently been reclassified to ""noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP),"" removing this entity from the malignant category. This re-categorization has had major implications for clinical management. NIFTP has overlapping cytohistologic features with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and with follicular adenomas (FA), but sonographic data comparing NIFTP to PTC and FA is lacking. Our study examines the sonographic features of NIFTP as compared with PTC and FA.


METHODS
Ultrasound scans and Doppler blood flow from subjects who had pre-surgical sonograms and fine needle aspiration biopsies with final surgical pathology diagnoses of NIFTP/nEFVPTC, classical PTC, and FA between 01/2013-08/2016 were assessed. Sonographic and Doppler features as well as Bethesda System (TBS) diagnoses were recorded and analyzed.


RESULTS
40 NIFTP, 58 classical PTC, and 23 FA cases were included. The most common NIFTP pre-surgical TBS cytology diagnosis was Atypia of Undetermined Significance (AUS/FLUS) (40%). NIFTP cases predominantly displayed wider-than-tall shape (100%), smooth borders (75%), occurrence in multinodular glands (82.5%), heterogeneous echogenicity (50%), both perinodular and intranodular Doppler flow patterns (70%), minimal Doppler flow grade (62.5%), and no calcifications (90%).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates that NIFTP, PTC, and FA display several distinguishing and overlapping sonographic and Doppler features. Sonographic features appear to complement cytology findings and may help raise pre-operative concern for NIFTP in the proper clinical setting, potentially leading to a more conservative management approach.",United States,Diagnostic cytopathology,29193910,2017,Does noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features have distinctive features on sonography?,n

A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment. The authors have developed software through which students can experience the practice of psychiatry (in particular, with dementia patients) in its entirety. This study compares this software with conventional learning methods.


METHOD
The control group was 43 fifth-year medical students in 2014 who studied using a conventional learning method (taking lectures and being in contact with actual patients). The experimental group was 36 fifth-year medical students in 2015 that used computer software (taking lectures and with reduced time in contact with actual patients). The authors compared the two groups. Each group was tested before and after clinical training on their acquisition of knowledge of dementia. The control group was tested in 2014, and the experimental group was tested in 2015.


RESULTS
The difference in average test scores between the two groups was statistically significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), with the experimental group scoring higher.

It remains unclear who should conduct apathy assessments in long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). Methods This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant, and one licensed practical nurse or activity staff. Family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff rated the resident's apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results The results revealed that ratings conducted by certified nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (râ€‰=â€‰0.47, pâ€‰=â€‰.08).

1528,"The acute hospital admission of patients with dementia is associated with poor outcome and higher costs. Much of our knowledge on how hospital stays are experienced by patients and staff is generated from short and fragmented data collections, in which the significance of knowledge about day-to-day care might be overlooked, and might partly explain why the poor outcome for this group of patients is not fully understood. This study used participant observation to follow patients with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards after fall incidents. To gather longitudinal data, patients were followed during day and evening shifts, from admission to discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The data showed that, despite having little specific knowledge about dementia care, staff were able to gather information about the patient's needs and wishes relevant to administrating medicine in a person-centred way.

To analyze the impact of measures undertaken to control brucellosis in the Republic of Macedonia on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the disease in humans.


METHODS
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients with brucellosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated at the University Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje during three time periods: 1989-1990 when no national strategy for disease control existed, 2000-2001 when some activities for control were performed and 2011-2014 when an organized and financially supported strategy was accomplished.


RESULTS
A drastic decrease of the number of cases of human brucellosis during the last period when compared to the first two ones (3.9 and 3.3 times lower, respectively) was evident. Patients from the third period were significantly older, with median age 41 years (range 4-73) vs. 31 years (3-77) and 34 years (1-74), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰.013). There were more males (86.6 vs. 73.6% and 63.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and the disease was more often acquired professionally (80.6 vs. 60.1% and 59.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.006).

1534,"BACKGROUND
Patients with brain lesions and resultant chronic aphasia frequently suffer from depression. However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial).


METHODS
In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test).


RESULTS
Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192534,2017,Intensive Communicative Therapy Reduces Symptoms of Depression in Chronic Nonfluent Aphasia.,y

Patients with neglect ignore or respond slower to contralesional stimuli. Neglect negatively influences independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most frequently studied treatments, yet there is little evidence regarding positive effects on neglect behavior in ADL.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether PA in the subacute phase ameliorates neglect in situations of varying complexity.


METHODS
A total of 70 neglect patients admitted for inpatient stroke rehabilitation received either PA or sham adaptation (SA) for 2 weeks, with full access to standard treatment. There were 7 time-dependent measurements (baseline and 1-4, 6, and 14 weeks after start of treatment). The primary outcome was change of neglect as observed during basic ADL with the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in performance on a dynamic multitask (ie, the Mobility Assessment Course [MAC]) and a static paper-and-pencil task (ie, a shape cancellation task [SC]).


RESULTS
In all, 34 patients received PA and 35 SA. There were significant time-dependent improvements in performance as measured with the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F > 15.57; P < .001). There was no significant difference in magnitude of improvement between groups on the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F < 2.54; P > .113].


CONCLUSIONS
No beneficial effects of PA over SA in the subacute phase poststroke were observed, which was comparable for situations of varying complexity. Heterogeneity of the syndrome, time post-stroke onset, and the content of treatment as usual are discussed.

To examine changes in breastfeeding rates in 0 to 6 month old infants in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, over the period from 2009 to 2015, for the total population as well as for various ethnic groups.

METHOD
Breastfeeding rates were examined for the period from 2009 to 2015 in 165,420 registrations of 75,543 infants at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for the entire Amsterdam population and for various ethnic groups. Differences were analysed using Ï‡2 tests.


RESULTS
The weighted percentage of total breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding as well as a combination of breast and formula feeding) increased in the entire Amsterdam study population over the period from 2009 to 2015 (2 weeks: 87.8% to 89.1%; 3 months: 61.6% to 63.6%; 6 months: 39.5% to 42.2%). Increases were mainly the result of increases in weighted percentages for exclusive breastfeeding. The highest exclusive breastfeeding rates were observed among the Turkish ethnic group, the lowest among the Antillean/Aruban and Surinamese groups.


CONCLUSION
Percentages for total breastfeeding as well as exclusive breastfeeding in Amsterdam rose over the period from 2009 to 2015, but there is room for improvement.

Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic influences on diurnal preference have exclusively included subjects of European ancestry. This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs. Genetic risk score (GRS) profiling detected shared genetic risk between evening preference and related disorders. Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012.

1544,"OBJECTIVE
Regenerated peripheral nervous tissue possesses different morphometric properties compared to undisrupted nerve. It is poorly understood how these morphometric differences alter the response of the regenerated nerve to electrical stimulation. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the electrophysiological response of regenerated and undisrupted nerve axons to electrical stimulation delivered by macro-sieve electrodes (MSEs).


APPROACH
A 3D finite element model of a peripheral nerve segment populated with mammalian myelinated axons and implanted with a macro-sieve electrode has been developed. Fiber diameters and morphometric characteristics representative of undisrupted or regenerated peripheral nervous tissue were assigned to core conductor models to simulate the two tissue types. Simulations were carried out to quantify differences in thresholds and chronaxie between undisrupted and regenerated fiber populations. The model was also used to determine the influence of axonal caliber on recruitment thresholds for the two tissue types. Model accuracy was assessed through comparisons with in-vivo recruitment data from chronically implanted MSEs.


MAIN RESULTS
Recruitment thresholds of individual regenerated fibers with diameters &gt;2 Âµm were found to be lower compared to same caliber undisrupted fibers at electrode to fiber distances of less than about 90-140 Âµm but roughly equal or higher for larger distances. Caliber redistributions observed in regenerated nerve resulted in an overall increase in average recruitment thresholds and chronaxie during whole nerve stimulation. Modeling results also suggest that large diameter undisrupted fibers located close to a longitudinally restricted current source such as the MSE have higher average recruitment thresholds compared to small diameter fibers. In contrast, large diameter regenerated nerve fibers located in close proximity of MSE sites have, on average, lower recruitment thresholds compared to small fibers. Utilizing regenerated fiber morphometry and caliber distributions resulted in accurate predictions of in-vivo recruitment data.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our work uses computational modeling to show how morphometric differences between regenerated and undisrupted tissue results in recruitment threshold discrepancies, quantifies these differences, and illustrates how large undisrupted nerve fibers close to longitudinally restricted current sources have higher recruitment thresholds compared to adjacently positioned smaller fibers while the opposite is true for large regenerated fibers.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192607,2017,Modelling the impact of altered axonal morphometry on the response of regenerative nervous tissue to electrical stimulation through macro-sieve electrodes.,y
1545,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this work is to improve the state of the art for motor-control with a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs use neurological recording devices and a decoding algorithms to transform brain activity directly into real-time control of a machine, archetypically a robotic arm or a cursor. The standard procedure treats neural activity--vectors of spike counts in small temporal windows--as noisy observations of the kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration) of the fingertip. Inferring the state from the observations then takes the form of a \emph{dynamical filter}, typically some variant on Kalman's (KF). The KF, however, although fairly robust in practice, is optimal only when the relationships between variables are linear and the noise is Gaussian, conditions usually violated in practice.


APPROACH
To overcome these limitations we introduce a new filter, the ""recurrent exponential-family harmonium"" (rEFH), that models the spike counts explicitly as Poisson-distributed, and allows for arbitrary nonlinear dynamics and observation models. Furthermore, the model underlying the filter is acquired through unsupervised learning, which allows temporal correlations in spike counts to be explained by latent dynamics that do not necessarily correspond to the kinematic state of the fingertip.


MAIN RESULTS
We test the rEFH on offline reconstruction of the kinematics of reaches in the plane. The rEFH outperforms the standard, as well as three other state-of-the-art, decoders, across three monkeys, two different tasks, most kinematic variables, and a range of bin widths, amounts of training data, and numbers of neurons.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our algorithm establishes a new state of the art for offline decoding of reaches---in particular, for fingertip velocities, the variable used for control in most online decoders.&#13.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192609,2017,"Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm.",y

This study examines the use of the number of night-time sleep disturbances as a health-based metric to assess the cost effectiveness of rail noise mitigation strategies for situations, wherein high-intensity noises dominate such as freight train pass-bys and wheel squeal.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty residential properties adjacent to the existing and proposed rail tracks in a noise catchment area of the Epping to Thornleigh Third Track project were used as a case study. Awakening probabilities were calculated for individual's awakening 1, 3 and 5 times a night when subjected to 10 independent freight train pass-by noise events using internal maximum sound pressure levels (LAFmax).


RESULTS
Awakenings were predicted using a random intercept multivariate logistic regression model. With source mitigation in place, the majority of the residents were still predicted to be awoken at least once per night (median 88.0%), although substantial reductions in the median probabilities of awakening three and five times per night from 50.9 to 29.4% and 9.2 to 2.7%, respectively, were predicted. This resulted in a cost-effective estimate of 7.6-8.8 less people being awoken at least three times per night per A$1 million spent on noise barriers.


CONCLUSION
The study demonstrates that an easily understood metric can be readily used to assist making decisions related to noise mitigation for large-scale transport projects.",India,Noise & health,29192613,2017,A Health-Based Metric for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Noise Barrier Mitigation Associated With Transport Infrastructure Noise.,y
1548,"CONTEXT
According to the attention restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors.


AIMS
By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50-min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40â€‰min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were re-tested. The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately re-tested. The difference between the two test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents the attention restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig.â€‰=â€‰0.027 (<0.050)].


RESULTS
The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95%) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8.4), 'traffic sounds group' (2.4) and 'machine sounds group' (-1.8).


CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, have a positive effect on the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration.",India,Noise & health,29192615,2017,Effects of Soundscape on the Environmental Restoration in Urban Natural Environments.,y

Hyperacusis is defined as a reduction in tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Hyperacusis can occur in individuals of all age groups, making daily life difficult for the sufferers. Although there is no objective test to accurately diagnose hyperacusis, questionnaires are useful for the assessment of hyperacusis. The aim of this study was to explore the reduced sound tolerance in university students using a hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 536 university students (300 females and 236 males) aged between 18 and 25 years, with a mean age of 21.34â€‰Â±â€‰1.87 years, were assessed using an HQ developed by Khalfa. The mean total score of all the participants was 16.34â€‰Â±â€‰7.91, and 5.78% of the participants had total scores indicating hyperacusis, where a majority of them were females.


RESULTS
Females had significantly higher scores than men in terms of both the total and the attentional and emotional dimensions. The scores of the participants who reported noise exposure or a decrease in their tolerance to noise were significantly higher than those of the other participants. Even among young adults, there was a group of participants suffering from some problems related to decreased tolerance to everyday sounds.


DISCUSSION
Although the Turkish translation of the HQ seems to be a reliable tool for evaluating hyperacusis in young adults, further work with various populations of different age groups is required to establish validity and to assess the psychometric qualities of the Turkish form.",India,Noise & health,29192616,2017,Assessment of Reduced Tolerance to Sound (Hyperacusis) in University Students.,y
1550,"OBJECTIVE
Children's own ratings and opinions on their schools sound environments add important information on noise sources. They can also provide information on how to further improve and optimize children's learning situation in their classrooms. This study reports on the Swedish translation and application of an evidence-based questionnaire that measures how children perceive the acoustic environment of their school.


STUDY DESIGN
The Swedish version was made using a back-to-back translation. Responses on the questionnaire along with demographic data were collected for 149 children aged 9-13 years of age.


RESULTS
The Swedish translation of the questionnaire can be reduced from 93 to 27 items. The 27 items were distributed over five separate factors measuring different underlying constructs with high internal consistency and high inter-item correlations. The responses demonstrated that the dining hall/canteen and the corridors are the school spaces with the poorest listening conditions. The highest annoyance was reported for tests and reading; next, student-generated sounds occur more frequently within the classroom than any sudden unexpected sounds, and finally, road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms are the most frequently occurring sounds from outside the classroom. Several demographic characteristics could be used to predict the outcome on these factors.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that crowded spaces are most challenging; the children themselves generate most of the noise inside the classroom, but it is also common to hear road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms. The extent of annoyance that noise causes depends on the task but seems most detrimental in tasks, wherein the demands of verbal processing are higher.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is fast becoming a global epidemic, and its prevalence is increasing in children and young adults. The aim of the study was to identify young adults who had type 2 DM or impaired fasting glucose as well as those at risk of these conditions using anthropometric data and behavioral pattern.


METHODOLOGY
Two hundred and twenty newly admitted undergraduates who were randomly selected during the registration process were involved in the study. Anthropometric parameters were measured while information on demographic details, medical history, and family history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method.


RESULTS
Two hundred and seven (94%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4%) had serum glucose> 7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2%) had body mass index <25.0 while 6.8% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day.


CONCLUSION
Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192627,2017,Behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes mellitus among newly admitted undergraduates in a Nigerian University.,y

To determine the pattern of significant intracerebral lesions in patients presenting with recurrent seizures in a tertiary hospital in Enugu.


METHODS
All the medical and computer tomography records of patients with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent seizures were reviewed. The study duration was 11 years (January 2003 to December 2013). Relevant data were obtained and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 and GraphPad Prism 6.


RESULTS
The diagnostic yield of CT was 55.1%. Twenty (9.3%) individuals had two lesions each. The significant findings were tumors (20.4%), encephalomalacia (18.9%) and strokes (7.7% (ischemic stroke, 4.1%, intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.1%, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.5%). Hydrocephalus (HCP) was found in 18 (9.2%) cases, and 30% of them occurred together with other lesions. The diagnostic yield increased with age reaching 84.4% from the age of 60 years. Only patients with encephalomalacia were statistically older than those with normal imaging.


CONCLUSION
Computed tomography scan has a high diagnostic yield, especially in elderly patients with recurrent generalized seizures. Brain tumors, encephalomalacia, and HCP are most common causes of recurrent seizures in the adults.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192634,2017,"The Pattern of significant lesions found in computerized tomography scan of recurrent seizure patients at a center in Enugu, Nigeria.",y
1553,"BACKGROUND
Obesity can lead to psychological, social, and medical problems that may negatively affect the quality of life Aim: In our study, we aimed to evaluate the body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life of obese subjects in comparison with normal weighted ones.


METHODS
A total of 494 subjects, aged between 18 and 64 years, were included to the study. Patients with the body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥18.5-24.9 kg/m2 were assigned to the control group; BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 were assigned to the obese patient group. An ethical committee approval with protocol No. of 2011/242 was obtained from the Ethical Committee of EskiÅŸehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine. Interviews were performed two times with obese subjects in the 1st and the 6th month of weight loss program, once with the control group. Data identification form, the form which included the biochemical parameters, Trait Anxiety inventory, State anxiety scale, Quality of Life scale-Short Form [(SF-36)(QOL)], Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), Zung Depression Rating Scale, and Zung Anxiety Rating Scale were applied to participants.


RESULTS
Obesity is more common in women. Obesity reduces the quality of life, negatively affects body perception, and triggers anxiety. Because of their body structure, obese individuals are exposed to social pressure and unethical attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Both health risks and social implications of obesity are important. Further studies are needed to ethically evaluate the psycho-social problems caused by obesity.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192636,2017,"Assessment of body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life among obese and nonobese subjects in Turkey.",y
1554,"This is the fourth and final paper of a series of reviews undertaken to explore the relationships between oral health and general medical conditions, in order to support teams within Public Health England, health practitioners and policy makers. This review aimed to explore the most contemporary evidence on whether poor oral health and dementia occurs in the same individuals or populations, to outline the nature of the relationship between these two health outcomes and to discuss the implication of any findings for health services and future research. The review was undertaken by a working group comprising consultant clinicians from medicine and dentistry, trainees, public health and academic staff. Whilst other rapid reviews in the current series limited their search to systematic reviews, this review focused on primary research involving cohort and case-control studies because of the lack of high level evidence in this new and important field. The results suggest that poor oral hygiene is associated with dementia, and more so amongst people in advanced stages of the disease. Suboptimal oral health (gingivitis, dental caries, tooth loss, edentulousness) appears to be associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. The findings are discussed in relation to patient care and future research.",England,British dental journal,29192686,2017,Evidence summary: the relationship between oral health and dementia.,y

1558,"Introduction Communication within the doctor-patient relationship is complex due to a variety of reasons; a patient's understanding may not correspond with the clinician's vocabulary, resulting in misunderstanding, anxiety and ill-informed decision making. We investigated the understanding of terminology commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine clinics.Methods We investigated patients' understanding using a questionnaire-based study in the out-patient setting. Age, gender, first language and highest educational level were recorded. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions regarding patients' understanding of words as well as asking patients to define certain terms. Vocabulary included 'ulcer', 'blister', 'cancer', 'malignant' and 'benign'.Results and conclusions Many patients have difficulty in understanding and explaining commonly used terminology. 'Blister' was the most commonly understood term, while 'benign' and 'lesion' were the least well understood. 'Tumour' was mistakenly thought of as synonymous with 'malignancy' by over a third of patients. Understanding was better among those for whom English was their first language. It is essential that all clinicians modify their language appropriately during consultations in order to deliver information in a comprehensive manner, to educate patients on their condition thus enabling informed decision making by patients.",England,British dental journal,29192691,2017,Patient understanding of commonly used oral medicine terminology.,y
1559,"OBJECTIVE
Perinatal loss (stillbirth or early infant death) is often a sudden, unexpected event for families. We evaluated who communicates the loss to the parents and who is there for support at the delivery or death.


STUDY DESIGN
We conducted a mail survey of 900 bereaved and 500 live-birth mothers to assess emotional, physical and reproductive health outcomes.


RESULTS
We had a 44% response rate at 9 months after birth or loss from 377 bereaved mothers and 232 with surviving infants. Bereaved women were less likely to have hospital staff or family members present at delivery. African-American (versus Caucasian) mothers were half as likely to have first heard about their stillbirth from a physician or midwife.

Although incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms appears to be a barrier to successful self-care, there are few studies examining the relationship between self-care and levels of comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.


AIM
To determine whether incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms is associated with self-care in heart failure patients who were recently discharged from the hospital due to heart failure exacerbation.


METHODS
Patients completed the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale and questionnaire to assess knowledge of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Three groups were formed by their different levels of understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether these three levels of understanding groups predicted self-care after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.


RESULTS
Of 571 patients 22.1%, 40.1% and 37.8% had poor, moderate, and complete understanding, respectively. Compared with patients in the poor understanding group, patients in complete and moderate understanding groups were more likely to have better adherence to self-care activities (standardized Î² = -0.14, 95% confidence interval -3.41, -0.47; standardized Î² = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -4.26, -1.23, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Fewer than half of the patients had a comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms, which was associated with poor self-care.

To maximise the benefits obtainable from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, an evaluation of physical fitness using reliable, clinically relevant tests is strongly recommended. Recently, objective tests of physical fitness have been implemented in the SWEDEHEART register. The reliability of these tests has, however, not been examined for patients with acute coronary syndrome.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of the symptom-limited bicycle ergometer test, the dynamic unilateral heel-lift test and the unilateral shoulder-flexion test in patients with acute coronary syndrome.


METHODS
In a longitudinal study design, a total of 40 patients (mean age 63.8 Â± 9.5 years, five women), with ACS, aged < 75 years, were included at a university hospital in Sweden. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval, standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsiveness in terms of the minimal detectable change were calculated.


RESULTS
Excellent reliability was found, showing ICC values of 0.98 (0.96-0.99), SEM 4.71 for the bicycle ergometer test, ICC 0.87 (0.75-0.93), SEM 4.62 for the shoulder-flexion test and ICC 0.84 (0.71-0.91), SEM 2.24 for the heel-lift test. The minimal detectable change was 13 W, 13 and 6 repetitions for the bicycle ergometer test, shoulder-flexion and heel-lift tests respectively.

Reliability efforts include interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP) and Lean quality/process improvement strategies, which require skilful facilitation. Currently, no validated Lean facilitator assessment tool for interprofessional collaboration exists. This article describes the development and pilot evaluation of such a tool; the Interprofessional Lean Facilitator Assessment Scale (ILFAS), which measures both technical and 'soft' skills, which have not been measured in other instruments. The ILFAS was developed using methodologies and principles from Lean/Shingo, IPCP, metacognition research and Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains. A panel of experts confirmed the initial face validity of the instrument. Researchers independently assessed five facilitators, during six Lean sessions. Analysis included quantitative evaluation of rater agreement. Overall inter-rater agreement of the assessment of facilitator performance was high (92%), and discrepancies in the agreement statistics were analysed. Face and content validity were further established, and usability was evaluated, through primary stakeholder post-pilot feedback, uncovering minor concerns, leading to tool revision. The ILFAS appears comprehensive in the assessment of facilitator knowledge, skills, abilities, and may be useful in the discrimination between facilitators of different skill levels.

1566,"Introduction Hypertension is one of the primary modifiable risk factors for cardiac and renal diseases. The prevalence of hypertension appears to be around 30-45% of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The administration of blood pressure-lowering drugs is to reduce the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes: stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths. Hypertension guidelines recommend combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk and with subclinical organ damage as well as when monotherapy fails. Areas covered As the etiology of essential hypertension is multifactorial, combination therapy using different classes of antihypertensive agents have greater effect than each on its own (synergistic effect), may have better tolerability (two components minimizing each other's side effects) and lead to improved patient compliance. Several studies assess the hypotensive efficacy on drug combination, there are also studies n triple drug combination. Expert commentary At present, dual and triple combination therapy is available to hypertensive patients with good clinical outcomes, compliance and low profile of side effects. Hypertensive patients usually have other cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. As patients' adherence to the pharmacological therapy significantly decreases the risk of long-term adverse events including mortality, use of single-pill combination therapy are not only good effects of free therapy but also better patient compliance. It appears that combinations not only of hypotensive drugs but also with statins will be widely used.

1568,"OBJECTIVE
This study A) assessed whether levels of alcohol-related disciplinary actions on college campuses changed among MD college students after the 2011 Maryland (MD) state alcohol tax increase from 6% to 9%, and B) determined which school-level factors impacted the magnitude of changes detected.


METHOD
A quasi-experimental interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of panel data containing alcohol-related disciplinary actions on 33 MD college campuses in years 2006-2013. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in counts of alcohol-related disciplinary actions comparing time before and after the tax increase.


RESULTS
The ITS anaysis showed an insignificant relationship between alcohol-related disciplinary actions and tax implementation (Î² = -.27; p =.257) but indicated that alcohol-related disciplinary actions decreased significantly over the time under study (Î² = -.05; p =.022).


DISCUSSION
Alcohol related disciplinary actions did decrease over time in the years of study, and this relationship was correlated with several school-level characteristics, including school price, school funding type, types of degrees awarded, and specialty.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques.


METHODS
Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6Â mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28Â days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations.


RESULTS
FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions. Vitamin D has positive effects on the hormonal and structural changes observed in PCOS, but it has been concluded that long-term use may be more beneficial.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192811,2017,Effects of vitamin D on ovary in DHEA-treated PCOS rat model: A light and electron microscopic study.,y
1570,"Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths. These results provide direct evidence for a causal link between processing preferences in individual speakers and patterns in linguistic diversity.",United States,Psychological science,29192836,2017,Human Information Processing Shapes Language Change.,y

Previous research has highlighted the benefits of telephone helplines as an accessible source of support for those who may not wish to access face-to-face support or to fill a gap for those waiting for treatment. This study aimed to gain an insight into the perspectives of those who may use or refer others to a telephone helpline in order to identify the requirements of such a service.

The findings indicated that telephone helplines may offer numerous benefits for individuals with an eating disorder, whether accessed as a first step, alongside treatment or as an extension of this support when in recovery. Additionally helplines may provide an opportunity for carers to access information and discuss their own experiences, while supporting their loved one.

1573,The amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insights into AÎ²-interacting proteins are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity. We recently undertook an in-depth in vitro interrogation of the AÎ²1-42 interactome using human frontal lobes as the biological source material and taking advantage of advances in mass spectrometry performance characteristics. These analyses uncovered the small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) to be the most selectively enriched binder to oligomeric AÎ²1-42. Subsequent validation experiments revealed that SST interferes with AÎ² fibrillization and promotes the formation of AÎ² assemblies characterized by a 50-60Â kDa SDS-resistant core. The distributions of SST and AÎ² overlap in the brain and SST has been linked to AD by several additional observations. This perspective summarizes this body of literature and draws attention to the fact that SST is one of several neuropeptide hormones that acquire amyloid properties before their synaptic release. The latter places the interaction between SST and AÎ² among an increasing number of observations that attest to the ability of amyloidogenic proteins to influence each other. A model is presented which attempts to reconcile existing data on the involvement of SST in the AD etiology.,United States,Prion,29192843,2017,Somatostatin in Alzheimer'S disease: A new Role for an Old Player.,y

1575,"OBJECTIVE The acquisition and refinement of cognitive and behavioral skills during development is associated with the maturation of various brain oscillatory activities. Most developmental investigations have identified distinct patterns of low-frequency electrophysiological activity that are characteristic of various behavioral milestones. In this investigation, the authors focused on the cross-sectional developmental properties of high-frequency spectral power from the brain's default mode network (DMN) during goal-directed behavior. METHODS The authors contrasted regionally specific, time-evolving high gamma power (HGP) in the lateral DMN cortex between 3 young children (age range 3-6 years) and 3 adults by use of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings over the left perisylvian cortex during a picture-naming task. RESULTS Across all participants, a nearly identical and consistent response suppression of HGP, which is a functional signature of the DMN, was observed during task performance recordings acquired from ECoG electrodes placed over the lateral DMN cortex. This finding provides evidence of relatively early maturation of the DMN. Furthermore, only HGP relative to evoked alpha and beta band power showed this level of consistency across all participants. CONCLUSIONS Regionally specific, task-evoked suppression of the high-frequency components of the cortical power spectrum is established early in brain development, and this response may reflect the early maturation of specific cognitive and/or computational mechanisms.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

In Experiment 1, we asked participants to perform two tasks that varied in cognitive demands: transcription and exposition about an autobiographical episode. Lacunarity was significantly lower in transcription. In Experiment 2, we compared a veridical and a fictitious version of a personal event. Lacunarity was lower in veridical texts.

Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192871,2017,What Does the DAP:IQ Measure?: Drawing Comparisons between Drawing Performance and Developmental Assessments.,y

Despite the finding that the children's comprehension of antisocial teasing tended to exceed their comprehension of prosocial teasing, the findings indicate that being relatively young (i.e., 5-6Â years old vs. 7-8Â years old) and having relatively frequent experience with antisocial teasing in the home may be associated with some children's difficulty in recognizing the intent behind antisocial teases.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192874,2017,Young Children's ability to Discriminate between Antisocial and Prosocial Teases.,y
1580,"OBJECTIVE Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, more patients with a high body mass index (BMI) will require surgical treatment for degenerative spinal disease. In previous investigations of lumbar spine pathology, obesity has been associated with worsened postoperative outcomes and increased costs. However, few studies have examined the association between BMI and postoperative outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes, postoperative narcotics consumption, complications, and hospital costs among BMI stratifications for patients who have undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF procedures. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained surgical database of patients who had undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spinal pathology between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified by BMI as follows: normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), or obese II-III (â‰¥ 35.0 kg/m2). Differences in patient demographics and preoperative characteristics were compared across the BMI cohorts using 1-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Multivariate linear or Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine the presence of an association between BMI category and narcotics utilization, improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores, incidence of complications, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, and hospital costs. Regression analyses were controlled for preoperative demographic and procedural characteristics. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients were included in the analysis, of whom 20.9% (n = 58) were normal weight, 37.5% (n = 104) were overweight, 24.9% (n = 69) were obese I, and 16.6% (n = 46) were obese II-III. A higher BMI was associated with an older age (p = 0.049) and increased comorbidity burden (p = 0.001). No differences in sex, smoking status, insurance type, diagnosis, presence of neuropathy, or preoperative VAS pain scores were found among the BMI cohorts (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found among these cohorts as regards operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and number of operative levels (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in postoperative narcotics consumption, VAS score improvement, complication rates, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, or total direct costs existed across BMI stratifications (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher BMI demonstrated surgical outcomes, narcotics consumption, and hospital costs comparable to those of patients with a lower BMI. Thus, ACDF procedures are both safe and effective for all patients across the entire BMI spectrum. Patients should be counseled to expect similar rates of postoperative complications and eventual clinical improvement regardless of their BMI.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

1581,"In response to varying stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor is able to promote repair, survival, or elimination of damaged cells - processes that have great relevance to organismal aging. Although the link between p53 and cancer is well established, the contribution of p53 to the aging process is less clear. Delineating how p53 regulates distinct aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered metabolic pathways will be critical. Mouse models have further revealed the centrality and complexity of the p53 network in aging processes. While naturally aged mice have linked longevity with declining p53 function, some accelerated aging mice present with chronic p53 activation, whose phenotypes can be rescued upon p53 deficiency. Further, direct modulation of the p53-MDM2 axis has correlated elevated p53 activity with either early aging or with delayed-onset aging. We speculate that p53-mediated aging phenotypes in these mice must have (1) stably active p53 due to MDM2 dysregulation or chronic stress or (2) shifted p53 outcomes. Pinpointing which p53 stressors, modifications, and outcomes drive aging processes will provide further insights into our understanding of the human aging process and could have implications for both cancer and aging therapeutics.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cdd.2017.187.",England,Cell death and differentiation,29192902,2017,Relevance of the p53-MDM2 axis to aging.,y

In recent years, the recovery-oriented approaches (along with experiences and thoughts of patients and patient's relatives) have been taken into account for establishing mental health services and policies. This study aims to identify the factors contributing to recovery, as observed from the perspective of schizophrenia patients working at The Blue Horse CafÃ© which was founded by the Federation of Schizophrenia Associations.


METHOD
The sample for the study consisted of 24 patients who worked at The Blue Horse CafÃ©. A phenomenological approach was used in the study, whereby interviews with patients were analyzed qualitatively.


RESULTS
Certain common factors, which were expressed as having contributed to recovery, were identified from the perspective of schizophrenia patients. These factors are: 1-The fact that the setting is informal and welcoming without being constrictive; 2-Predominance of the human element; 3-Hope and encouragement; 4-Being cared about; 5-Being able to reach someone when in need of support; 6-Friendly sharing; 7-Having a purpose, assuming responsibility, and being motivated; and 8-Giving meaning to life.


CONCLUSION
The findings may serve as a stimulus since schizophrenia patients that contribute to recovery give mental health professionals the opportunity to question there need for a change in their professional roles.

Impairment in immune functions is proposed as a key factor in the cognitive decline in bipolar disorder (BD) however there is scarcity of research on the impact of inflammation on cognitive functions. Our aim is to compare IL-18 and IL-6 levels in BD patients and controls and to study the relationship between IL-18 and IL-6 levels and cognitive impairment METHOD: Thirty-six euthymic BD-I patients and 38 age, sex and educational level matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants were evaluated with neurocognitive tests. The plasma IL-6 and IL-18 levels of both groups were measured with ELISA kits.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between IL-6 and IL-18 levels of patient and healthy control groups. In the patient group, IL-18 level was positively correlated with completed categories score wheras there was a negative correlation with perseverative response and perseverative errors. Moreover IL-18 level was positively correlated with immediate recall, delayed recall and learning scores while there was a negative correlation with stroop interference scores. No correlation was found between IL-6 level and neuropsychological test scores in the patient group.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study that investigates the relation of IL-18 with cognitive functions.

This study aimed to examine the cognitive profiles of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the latter of which was recently standardized in Turkey. In addition, the reading abilities and intelligence scores of these children were also investigated.


METHODS
A total of 48 children with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 16 years who were outpatients in MuÅŸ State Hospital were included in this study. The children were administered the WISC-R, the WISC-IV, and the Oral Reading Skills and Reading Comprehension Test (ORCT).


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the WISC-R IQ scores and WISC-IV index scores. Moreover, reading comprehension skills (derived from ORCT scores) were predicted with significant accuracy by both the WISC-R Verbal IQ and the WISC-IV WMI (Working Memory Index).


CONCLUSION
Results of this study suggest that the WISC-R and the WISC-IV scale are not sufficient for obtaining a specific cognitive profile for ADHD - there is no significant difference between them. However, the four-factor structure of the WISC-IV is believed to provide more specific information. In addition, results of this study related to reading skills indicate that the importance of reading skills should not be overlooked when assessing children with ADHD.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192943,2017,[Comparing Two Editions of Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Assessing Reading Skills in Children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder].,y

We aimed to review the literature related to attention, memory, and executive functions in PTSD. Although studies on the subject are limited (in that there is no uniformity in terms of trauma type, selection of the control groups or types of neuropsychological tests used), most reported similar deficits in PTSD subjects in terms of memory and executive functions including attention. Since the presence of psychiatric comorbidities may disrupt neuropsychological functions, results of studies that have not controlled comorbidity may be questionable. However, studies that excluded the comorbid conditions reported similar deficits in cognitive functions in PTSD patients. The relationship between recovery from PTSD symptoms and change in cognitive functions has been examined in only a few studies, and most have reported an improvement for both memory and executive functions in remitted patients. The improvement in executive functions, however, has been limited by the difficulty of task. Cognitive deficits have been among the major causes of disabilities in PTSD patients.

Dementia-related behavioral symptoms and functional dependence result in poor quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The goal was to determine whether a home-based activity program (Tailored Activity Program; TAP-VA) would reduce behavioral symptoms and functional dependence of veterans with dementia and caregiver burden.


DESIGN
Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).


SETTING
Veteran's homes.


PARTICIPANTS
Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).


INTERVENTION
Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.


MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.


RESULTS
Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control). At 4 months, compared to controls, the TAP-VA group showed reductions in number (difference in mean change from baseline = -0.68, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.13) and frequency by severity (-24.3, 95% CI = -45.6 to -3.1) of behavioral symptoms, number of activities needing assistance with (-0.80, 95% CI = -1.41 to -0.20), functional dependence level (4.09, 95% CI = 1.06, 7.13), and pain (-1.18, 95% CI = -2.10 to -0.26). Caregivers of veterans in TAP-VA reported less behavior-related distress. Benefits did not extend to 8 months.

Smoke-free laws reduce disease prevalence. The impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky was examined. The authors hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of smoke-free laws.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of 83,727 Kentucky residents agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50 years who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 1995 to 2014. In 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free laws. County-level characteristics included adult smoking rate, sex, race/ethnicity, income, physician supply, observed radon values, and rurality.


RESULTS
Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The difference in lung cancer incidence between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws did not confer the same benefit. One hundred percent smoke-free laws, covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions, may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.

For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62 Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs, economic returns and chances of success of investments in different tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect varied substantially by parental social class and level of education. The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates increased their participation in more rewarding university fields. Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects. Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.",England,The British journal of sociology,29193014,2017,Information barriers and social stratification in higher education: evidence from a field experiment.,y

To examine the diagnostic ability of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <36wks postmenstrual age) to detect later adverse motor outcomes or cerebral palsy (CP) in infants born preterm.


METHOD
Studies of infants born preterm with MRI earlier than 36 weeks postmenstrual age and quantitative motor data or a diagnosis of CP at or beyond 1 year corrected age were identified. Study details were extracted and meta-analyses performed where possible. Quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 (a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies).


RESULTS
Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which reported diagnostic accuracy and five reported data sufficient for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. Early structural MRI global scores detected a later diagnosis of CP with a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86-100) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 59-100). Global structural MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 44-100) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 90-100). White matter scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 20-48) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 78-88).


INTERPRETATION
Early structural MRI has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine adverse motor outcomes and CP in infants born preterm. Greater reporting of diagnostic accuracy in studies examining relationships with motor outcomes and CP is required to facilitate clinical utility of early MRI.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine later adverse motor outcomes and cerebral palsy (CP). Detection of infants who progressed to CP was stronger than motor outcomes. Global MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes more accurately than white matter scores.

To examine the factors contributing to nurses choosing to exit the nursing profession before retirement age.


BACKGROUND
Population growth, ageing and growing demand for health services mean increased demand for nurses. Better retention could help meet this demand, yet little work has been done in New Zealand to understand early attrition.


METHODS
An online survey of registered and enrolled nurses and nurse practitioners who had left nursing was used. This study reports analysis of responses from 285 ex-nurses aged under 55.


FINDINGS
The primary reasons nurses left the profession were as follows: workplace concerns; personal challenges; career factors; family reasons; lack of confidence; leaving for overseas; unwillingness to complete educational requirements; poor work-life balance; and inability to find suitable nursing work. Most nurses discussed their intentions to leave with a family member or manager and most reported gaining transferrable skills through nursing.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses leave for many reasons. Implementing positive practice environments and individualized approaches to retaining staff may help reduce this attrition. Generational changes in the nature of work and careers mean that nurses may continue to leave the profession sooner than anticipated by policymakers.


IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
If the nursing workforce is to be able to meet projected need, education, recruitment and retention policies must urgently address issues leading to early attrition. In particular, policies improving the wider environmental context of nursing practice and ensuring that working environments are safe and nurses are well supported must be developed and implemented. Equally, national nursing workforce planning must take into account that nursing is no longer viewed as a career for life.",England,International nursing review,29193041,2017,Early nurse attrition in New Zealand and associated policy implications.,y

1596,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic sleep deficiency is associated with early mortality. In the epileptic population, there is a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, and individuals with severe refractory epilepsy are at greater risk of premature mortality than the general population. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affects 1:1000 cases of epilepsy each year. Ketogenic diet (KD) treatment is one of the few effective options for refractory seizures. Despite KD reducing seizures and increasing longevity in Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, they still succumb to sudden death. This study aims to determine whether (1) the rest profiles of KO and KD-treated KO (KOKD) mice resemble each other as a function of either age or proximity to death and (2) the timing of death correlates with acute or chronic changes in rest.


METHODS
Noninvasive actimetry was used to monitor rest throughout the lives of KO and wild-type (WT) littermates administered standard diet or KD.


RESULTS
As KO mice age, rest is reduced (PÂ <Â .0001). Rest is significantlyÂ improved in KDKO mice (PÂ <Â .0001), resembling WT values at several ages. When age is removed as a variable and data are realigned to the day of death, the rest profiles of KO and KOKD groups worsen to similar degrees as a function of proximity to death. The amount of rest acutely is not sensitive to the timing of death, whereas chronic rest deficiency profiles (10-15Â days prior to death) of both groups were indistinguishable. Chronic accumulation of rest deficiency over the final 15Â days was associated with 75% of deaths.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our data suggest that the accumulated rest deficiency is associated with sudden death in Kv1.1 KO mice. These data (1) support the proposed clinical hypothesis that chronic sleep deficiency may be associated with early mortality in epileptic patients and (2) warrant future preclinical and clinical studies on sleep monitoring in epileptic patients.",United States,Epilepsia,29193044,2017,"Accumulation of rest deficiency precedes sudden death of epileptic Kv1.1 knockout mice, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",y

1599,"OBJECTIVE
Using a ""double-pulse"" adaptation paradigm, in which two stimuli are presented in quick succession, this study examines the neural mechanisms underlying potentiation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in visual snow syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous ""double-pulse"" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.


METHODS
We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.


RESULTS
In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",United States,Headache,29193050,2017,Antagonistic Relationship Between VEP Potentiation and Gamma Power in Visual Snow Syndrome.,y

A cross-sectional study was used to investigate the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors and determine whether psychiatric comorbidities modify this association in a nationwide inpatient cohort.


METHODS
We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations compiled from USA billing data. Migraine, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric disorders were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes from hospitalization discharges (2007-2012). Weighted national estimates were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
156,172,826 hospitalizations were included, of which 1.4% had a migraine diagnosis and 1.6% had a diagnosis of suicidal behavior. Migraineurs had a 2.07-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.96-2.19) compared with non-migraineurs. We repeated analyses after stratifying by depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among hospitalizations with depression, migraine was associated with a 20% reduced odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 0.76-0.85). Among hospitalizations without depression, migraine was associated with 2.35-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 2.20-2.51). In stratified analyses, we noted that among hospitalizations with anxiety, migraineurs had slightly increased odds of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.13). Among hospitalizations without anxiety, migraine was associated with a 2.06-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.94-2.20). Similarly, in analyses stratified by PTSD, migraine was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94-1.07) among those with PTSD. However, the odds of suicidal behaviors were increased among hospitalizations without PTSD (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.84-2.08).


CONCLUSION
Chronic conditions that do not affect the current hospitalization may not have been reported. The presence of psychiatric diagnoses influences associations of suicidal behaviors with migraine in a national inpatient sample. Migraineurs with diagnosed comorbid psychiatric disorders may be receiving care that mitigates their risk for suicidal behaviors.",United States,Headache,29193052,2017,Association Between Migraine and Suicidal Behaviors: A Nationwide Study in the USA.,y
1601,"Variation in the shape of the human face and in stature is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental influences. One such environmental influence is malnourishment, which can result in growth faltering, usually diagnosed by means of comparing an individual's stature with a set of age-appropriate standards. These standards for stature, however, are typically ascertained in groups where people are at low risk for growth faltering. Moreover, genetic differences among populations with respect to stature are well established, further complicating the generalizability of stature-based diagnostic tools. In a large sample of children aged 5-19 years, we obtained high-resolution genomic data, anthropometric measures and 3D facial images from individuals within and around the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. With genome-wide complex trait analysis, we partitioned genetic and environmental variance for growth outcomes and facial shape. We found that children with growth faltering have faces that look like those of older and taller children, in a direction opposite to the expected allometric trajectory, and in ways predicted by the environmental portion of covariance at the community and individual levels. The environmental variance for facial shape varied subtly but significantly among communities, whereas genetic differences were minimal. These results reveal that facial shape preserves information about exposure to undernourishment, with important implications for refining assessments of nutritional status in children and the developmental-genetics of craniofacial variation alike.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193055,2017,Facial shape manifestations of growth faltering in Tanzanian children.,y
1602,"OBJECTIVE
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive change resulting from challenging life events. The current study examined factors associated with PTG in traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.


METHOD
Participants (NÂ =Â 221) in this prospective cohort study included adults admitted to a Level I trauma center. Over half the participants (60%) were male, with a mean age of 47. Participants completed baseline measures during hospitalization. PTG was assessed at 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Greater PTG was associated with minority race/ethnicity, lower income, automotive collision, and premorbid psychological disorder other than depression or posttraumatic stress (PTS). These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients. Analysis confirmed that greater PTS at follow-up was associated with more growth.


CONCLUSION
Participants with the most growth also experienced the most distress. This finding demonstrates the importance of implementing psychological screening and intervention for trauma patients in the acute care setting to reduce PTS and facilitate growth.",United States,Journal of clinical psychology,29193058,2017,Posttraumatic growth in a heterogeneous sample of traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.,y
1603,"The adolescent brain is vulnerable to long-lasting cognitive disturbances resulting from nicotine exposure. Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED) and high- (HE), moderate- (ME) and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30 min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with Î±7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical Î±7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

The highest break points occurred during the token reinforcement condition for two out of three participants, but response rates tended to be higher with edibles. We then evaluated the effects of presession access to edibles on the break points of edible items and tokens with two participants. Break points decreased only in the edible reinforcement condition, and the participants chose to work for leisure items rather than edibles when presession access to edibles was in place.

In a pair of studies, we have corroborated that merely expressing attitudes towards the Jewish minority affects people's relevant behaviour towards this group. In an Internet study, participants who first completed verbal attitude measures were more likely to donate to a Jewish organisation compared to those who completed the measures after making the decision to donate. Moreover, responses to attitude measures of various types and donating to the Jewish organisation were correlated when attitudes had been expressed in the first step. When attitudes were measured after the decision to donate, only the responses to the traditional anti-Semitic scale were correlated with this behaviour. In the field study, in which the time interval between attitude and behaviour measures was introduced, no question-behaviour effect was observed. We explain the results with reference to cognitive dissonance and attitude accessibility mechanisms and discuss them in a broader context of attitude-behaviour research.",England,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,29193062,2017,The question-behaviour effect in intergroup attitudes research: When do attitudes towards a minority predict a relevant behaviour?,y
1606,"Auditory brainstem neurons are functionally primed to fire action potentials (APs) at markedly high-rates in order to rapidly encode acoustic information of sound. This specialization is critical for survival and the comprehension of behaviourally relevant communication functions, including sound localization and understanding speech in noise. Here, we investigated underlying ion channel mechanisms essential for high-rate AP firing in neurons of the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM) - the avian analog of bushy cells of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In addition to the established function of high-voltage activated potassium channels, we found that resurgent sodium current (INaR ) plays a role in regulating rapid firing activity of late-developing (embryonic [E] days 19-21) NM neurons. INaR of late-developing NM neurons showed similar properties with mammalian neurons in that its unique mechanism of an ""open channel block state"" facilitated the recovery and increased the availability of sodium (NaV ) channels after depolarization. Using a computational model of NM neurons, we demonstrated that removal of INaR reduced high-rate AP firing. We found weak INaR during a prehearing period (E11-12), which transformed to resemble late-developing INaR properties around hearing onset (E14-16). Anatomically, we detected strong NaV 1.6 expression near maturation, which became increasingly less distinct at hearing onset and prehearing periods, suggesting that multiple NaV channel subtypes may contribute to INaR during development. We conclude that INaR plays an important role in regulating rapid AP firing for NM neurons, a property that may be evolutionarily conserved for functions related to similar avian and mammalian hearing.

1607,"This study aimed to investigate whether variable patterns of responses can be acquired and maintained by negative reinforcement under an avoidance contingency. Six male Wistar rats were exposed to sessions in which behavioral variability was reinforced according to a Lag contingency: Sequences of three responses on two levers had to differ from one, two or three previous sequences for shocks to be avoided (Lag 1, Lag 2 and Lag 3, respectively). Performance under the Lag conditions was compared with performance on a Yoke condition in which the animals received the same reinforcement frequency and distribution as in the Lag condition but behavioral variability was not required. The results showed that most of the subjects varied their sequences under the Lag contingencies, avoiding shocks with relatively high probability (â‰¥ 0.7). Under the Yoke procedure, responding continued to occur with high probability, but the behavioral variability decreased. These results suggest that behavioral variability can be negatively reinforced.",United States,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,29193141,2017,Behavioral variability as avoidance behavior.,y
1608,"BACKGROUND
Exposure to alcohol content in movies has been shown to be associated with adolescent use of alcohol, including earlier onset. This study examined the influence of movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol onset, considering the social context (whether the movie was viewed with a friend or parent). We examined whether media's influence holds across a spectrum of early drinking milestones: sipping (but not consuming a full drink of) alcohol, consuming a full drink of alcohol, and engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED).


METHODS
Data were taken from a sample of 882 middle school youth (52% female; 24% non-White) enrolled in an ongoing study on alcohol initiation and progression. Exposure to alcohol content in films was measured using a method that combines content analysis and random assignment of movie titles to youth surveys. The hazard of initiating alcohol use (sip, full drink, HED) as a function of exposure was estimated using survival analysis. Associations were adjusted for demographic, personality, and social influence factors known to be associated with both movie exposure and alcohol use.


RESULTS
Exposure to alcohol content was common. Hours of exposure prospectively predicted earlier onset of alcohol involvement across all outcomes. Viewing movies with friends appeared to augment the media exposure effect, in contrast to viewing movies with parents, which was not a significant predictor of initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to alcohol in films is involved in the entry into early stages of alcohol involvement. Findings support further investigation into the role of the media in underage drinking, especially in the context of consuming media with friends and peers. Limiting media exposure and/or stronger Federal Trade Commission oversight of movie ratings should be a priority for preventing underage drinking.",England,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",29193150,2017,Exposure to Alcohol Content in Movies and Initiation of Early Drinking Milestones.,y

1610,"The primary goal of this study was to examine and describe the importance of childbearing as perceived by infertile women in the Chinese familial and social context. We adopted a qualitative descriptive method and conducted semi-structured interviews with female patients diagnosed with infertility. Participants were recruited at a high-volume fertility clinic in Tianjin, China. Fifteen women with a diagnosis of infertility were interviewed for 60-90â€‰min. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Two themes supported the importance of childbearing for Chinese women with infertility: childbearing as natural law, and childbearing for relational harmony. Childbearing as natural law referred to intrinsic forces to seek a child, including (i) achieving motherhood and womanhood and (ii) experiencing a developmental transition with childbearing as a landmark. Relational harmony included three primary factors: (i) to maintain marital quality by preventing marital failure and rejuvenating an unsatisfactory marital relationship; (ii) to fulfill both authoritative and reciprocal filial piety; (iii) to build a sense of normalcy within family and social networks. In summary, infertility resulted in loss of motherhood, womanhood, and a smooth developmental transition. Moreover, it threatened relationship harmony in the marriage, family, and social life. These insights on the value of childbearing in the Chinese context can inform healthcare professionals in identify infertility-related demands and developing relevant psychosocial services for people with infertility.",United States,Research in nursing & health,29193167,2017,Childbearing importance: A qualitative study of women with infertility in China.,y

As the workforce ages, occupational injuries from falls on the same level will increase. Some industries may be more affected than others.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate same-level fall injury incidence rates by age group, gender, and industry for four sectors: 1) healthcare and social assistance; 2) manufacturing; 3) retail; and 4) transportation and warehousing. We calculated rate ratios and rate differences by age group and gender.


RESULTS
Same-level fall injury incidence rates increase with age in all four sectors. However, patterns of rate ratios and rate differences vary by age group, gender, and industry. Younger workers, men, and manufacturing workers generally have lower rates.

1612,"Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of emerging infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour changes on epidemics can be key to improving control efforts. However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases. Therefore, in terms of mitigating emerging infectious diseases, both media publicity focused on how to guide people's behaviour change and positive responses of individuals are critical.",England,Statistics in medicine,29193194,2017,Impact of individual behaviour change on the spread of emerging infectious diseases.,y

While it is known that informal caregiving is associated with care-derived self-esteem cross-sectionally, little is known about the impact of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. Thus, we aimed at examining whether informal caregiving affects general self-esteem using a longitudinal approach.


METHODS
Data were gathered from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 40 and over in Germany from 2002 to 2014 (n = 21 271). General self-esteem was quantified using the Rosenberg scale. Individuals were asked whether they provide informal care regularly.


RESULTS
Fixed effects regressions showed no significant effect of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. General self-esteem decreased with increasing morbidity, increasing age, decreasing social ties, whereas it was not associated with changes in employment status, marital status and body mass index. Additional models showed that decreases in self-esteem were associated with decreases in functional health and increases in depressive symptoms.

In addition, these persons are prescribed lifelong medical treatment that requires regular monitoring. Through 11 individual interviews, this interpretive description study aimed to explore and describe lifelong medical treatment and the need for medical controls as experienced from the perspective of older individuals living with chronic AF. The interviews were performed during 2014-2015; furthermore, they were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed for thematic patterns using thematic analysis inspired by Braun and Clarke. Ethical standards were followed throughout the study. The findings revealed one main theme: 'ambivalence in the need of knowledge' showing that lifelong medical treatment and the need for medical controls, in general, meant experiencing feelings of 'it doesn't matter, but it does matter' and 'being in the hands of the healthcare system'. The older persons lacked knowledge about their condition, which generated poor insight into their medical treatment and this in turn affected their daily life. They had thoughts and questions about their medication, but did not have an opportunity to ask the questions because of lack of follow-up from the healthcare system.

1616,"Animals maintained in captivity exhibit rapid changes in phenotypic traits, which may be maladaptive for natural environments. The phenotype can shift away from the wild phenotype via transgenerational effects, with the environment experienced by parents influencing the phenotype and fitness of offspring. There is emerging evidence that controlling transgenerational effects could help mitigate the effects of captivity, improving the success of captively bred animals post release. However, controlling transgenerational effects requires knowledge of the mechanisms driving transgenerational changes. To better understand the genetic mechanisms that contribute to transgenerational effects in captivity we investigated the heritability of behavioral phenotypes using mid parent- and single parent-offspring regressions in a population of captive-reared house mouse (Mus musculus) that we had previously shown exhibit transgenerational changes in boldness and activity behavioral types. Slopes for boldness and activity were all positive, indicating a low to moderate degree of heritability. Though, none of the heritability estimates were statistically significant due to the large surrounding errors. However, the large error surrounding the heritability estimates may also indicate that there is variability in heritability between behavioral traits within the boldness and activity behavioral types. The implication of this finding is that the potential for heritable genetic changes in captivity varies considerably between traits. We conclude that continued investigation of the potential for traits to evolve in captivity is needed to better inform captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",United States,Zoo biology,29193268,2017,What role does heritability play in transgenerational phenotypic responses to captivity?

1618,"For species at risk of decline or extinction in source-sink systems, sources are an obvious target for habitat protection actions. However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for three endangered species. Using empirically-based habitat-population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of time periods of data collection and prioritized the strongest sources for conservation. We then tested the ability of prioritized patches to identify the most habitats most affecting persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Our results indicated that conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection can impact species persistence. Shorter times series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. As source-sink metrics (i.e., births-deaths; births and immigrations - deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many non-equilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.

1620,"PURPOSE
Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+.


METHODS
Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income.


FINDINGS
In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional.

1621,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a novel feature refinement MR reconstruction method from highly undersampled multichannel acquisitions for improving the image quality and preserve more detail information.


THEORY AND METHODS
The feature refinement technique, which uses a feature descriptor to pick up useful features from residual image discarded by sparsity constrains, is applied to preserve the details of the image in compressed sensing and parallel imaging in MRI (CS-pMRI). The texture descriptor and structure descriptor recognizing different types of features are required for forming the feature descriptor. Feasibility of the feature refinement was validated using three different multicoil reconstruction methods on in vivo data.


RESULTS
Experimental results show that reconstruction methods with feature refinement improve the quality of reconstructed image and restore the image details more accurately than the original methods, which is also verified by the lower values of the root mean square error and high frequency error norm.


CONCLUSION
A simple and effective way to preserve more useful detailed information in CS-pMRI is proposed. This technique can effectively improve the reconstruction quality and has superior performance in terms of detail preservation compared with the original version without feature refinement.

Remarkably, the presence of an identified early insult that constitutes a risk for development of epilepsy provides a therapeutic window in which the pathological processes associated with brain injury can be manipulated to limit the subsequent development of recurrent seizure activity and epilepsy. Recent studies have revealed diverse pathologies, including enhanced excitability, activated immune signaling, cell death, and enhanced neurogenesis within a week after injury, suggesting a period of heightened adaptive and maladaptive plasticity. An integrated understanding of these processes and their cellular and molecular underpinnings could lead to novel targets to arrest epileptogenesis after trauma. This review attempts to highlight and relate the diverse early changes after trauma and their role in development of epilepsy and suggests potential strategies to limit neurological complications in the injured brain.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193309,2017,Converging early responses to brain injury pave the road to epileptogenesis.,y
1624,"The signaling network involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not yet fully understood. This review aims to describe possible mechanisms through which the bacterial modulators may be linked directly or indirectly to the process of alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. From the late 1970s to present, new paradigm shifts have been developed regarding our understanding of pathological bone remodeling in periodontal disease. Upcoming evidence suggests that in periodontal disease the local immune response is exacerbated and involves the existence of signaling pathways that have been shown to modulate bone-cell function leading to alveolar bone loss. Those complex signaling pathways have been observed not only between bacteria but also between bacteria and the gingival surface of the host. More specifically, it has been shown that bacteria, through their secretion molecules, may interact indirectly and directly with immune-type cells of the host, resulting in the production of osteolytic agents that enhance bone resorption. Further research is required to provide a clear understanding of the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, and the availability of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis, may be useful tools in achieving this.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193310,2017,Bacterial modulators of bone remodeling in the periodontal pocket.,y
1625,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should combine individual level participant data across studies of children's responses to disasters to better understand PTSS trajectories.",United States,Journal of traumatic stress,29193316,2017,Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Trajectories Among Children After Disaster Exposure: A Review.,y

The project was implemented through a unique partnership between nursing faculty and Cooperative Extension Educators, community-based workers who are associated with fulfilling the mission of Land Grant Universities. The core focus of the project entailed a nurse and a Cooperative Extension Educator co-teaching trauma-informed parenting classes to rural dwelling, kinship caregivers. Kinship caregivers are often grandparents who assume the parenting role after the child has been removed from the birth parents' care. The trauma-informed curriculum was developed by experts in child trauma and is available through the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. The unique partnership provided insight into the different missions of the two organizations, different values and workflow metrics, and different schedules, which at times proved to be barriers to implementation.

1627,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the longitudinal association of dual and single (vision and hearing) sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults.


METHODS
Two thousand eight hundred ninety adults aged 60Â years or over who participated in the longitudinal population-based TromsÃ¸ Study, Norway, were included. The impact of objective vision loss, self-report hearing loss, or dual sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety, as assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 10, was examined at baseline and 6-year follow-up using linear mixed models.


RESULTS
Hearing loss had a cross-sectional relationship with increased depression (bÂ =Â 0.1750, SEÂ =Â 0.07, PÂ =Â .02) and anxiety symptoms (bÂ =Â 0.1765, SEÂ =Â 0.08, PÂ =Â .03); however, these relationships were not significant at the 6-year follow-up. Both vision loss only and dual sensory loss predicted increased depression scores at follow-up (bÂ =Â 0.0220, SEÂ =Â 0.01, PÂ =Â .03; and bÂ =Â 0.0413, SEÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Adjustment for social isolation did not attenuate the main depression results.


CONCLUSION
Dual sensory loss resulted in increased depression symptomatology over time and posed an additional long-term risk to depression severity beyond having a single sensory loss only. Only hearing loss is associated with anxiety symptoms. Older adults with vision, hearing, and dual sensory loss have different mental health profiles. Therefore, management and intervention should be tailored to the type of sensory loss.",England,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,29193338,2017,"The association amongst visual, hearing, and dual sensory loss with depression and anxiety over 6Â years: The TromsÃ¸ Study.",y
1628,"PURPOSE
Dynamic manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) allows assessment of tissue viability by tracing manganese uptake. We aimed to develop a rapid T1 mapping method for dynamic MEMRI to facilitate assessments of murine kidney viability.


METHODS
A multi-slice saturation recovery fast spin echo (MSRFSE) was developed, validated, and subsequently applied in dynamic MEMRI at 16.4T on ischemic mouse kidneys after 4 weeks of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Baseline T1 values and post-contrast R1 (1/T1 ) changes were measured in cortex (CO), outer (OSOM), inner (ISOM) strips of outer medulla, and inner medulla (IM).


RESULTS
Validation studies showed strong agreement between MSRFSE and an established saturation recovery Look-Locker method. Baseline T1 (s) increased in the stenotic kidney CO (2.10 [1.95-2.56] vs. 1.88 [1.81-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0317) and OSOM (2.17 [2.05-2.33] vs. 1.96 [1.87-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0075) but remained unchanged in ISOM and IM. This method allowed a temporal resolution of 1.43â€‰min in dynamic MEMRI. Mn2+ uptake and retention decreased in stenotic kidneys, particularly in the OSOM (Î”R1 : 0.48 [0.38-0.56] vs. 0.64 [0.61-0.69] s-1 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).


CONCLUSION
Dynamic MEMRI by MSRFSE detected decreased cellular viability and discerned the regional responses to RAS. This technique may provide a valuable tool for noninvasive evaluation of renal viability.

1629,"PURPOSE
In typical MRI protocols, time is spent acquiring a field map to calculate the shim settings for best image quality. We propose a fast template-based field map prediction method that yields near-optimal shims without measuring the field.


METHODS
The template-based prediction method uses prior knowledge of the B0 distribution in the human brain, based on a large database of field maps acquired from different subjects, together with subject-specific structural information from a quick localizer scan. The shimming performance of using the template-based prediction is evaluated in comparison to a range of potential fast shimming methods.


RESULTS
Static B0 shimming based on predicted field maps performed almost as well as shimming based on individually measured field maps. In experimental evaluations at 7â€‰T, the proposed approach yielded a residual field standard deviation in the brain of on average 59â€‰Hz, compared with 50â€‰Hz using measured field maps and 176â€‰Hz using no subject-specific shim.


CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that shimming based on predicted field maps is feasible. The field map prediction accuracy could potentially be further improved by generating the template from a subset of subjects, based on parameters such as head rotation and body mass index.

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.


OBJECTIVES
Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.


METHODS
Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: ""tremor"", ""tremor disorders"", ""essential tremor"", ""dystonic tremor"", and ""classification"" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.


RESULTS
Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2.

1631,"BACKGROUND
Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes.


METHODS
Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite scores.


RESULTS
Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.03 units/year, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003); this difference was comparable with 8â€‰years of aging. However, being in the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal (pâ€‰=â€‰0.71) or global score (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory decline (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.01 units/year, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.002; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive function-attention decline.


CONCLUSIONS
A variable pattern of depressive symptom severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern related to decline in executive function-attention. Findings could signal differences in underlying neuropathologic processes among persons with differing depression patterns and late-life cognitive decline.

1632,"CONTEXT
Medical educators often have prior and primary experience in other academic and clinical disciplines. Individuals seeking successful careers in the education of medical students and doctors must, at some point in their development, make a conscious transition into a new identity as a medical educator. This is a necessary move if individuals are to commit to acquiring and maintaining specialist expertise in medical education. Some achieve this transition successfully, whereas others struggle and may even lose interest and abandon the endeavour. We explored senior educators' experiences of achieving the transition into medical education and their views on what helps and what hinders the process.


METHODS
In 2015 we conducted three focus groups with 15 senior medical educators. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied transition theory to guide our deductive analysis, using Schlossberg's Four S (4S) framework to code and report participants' self-reported perceptions of those factors relating to Self, Situation, Support and Strategy that had assisted them to make a successful transition to a fully acknowledged medical educator identity. Through inductive analysis, we then identified 17 explanatory sub-themes common to all three focus groups.


RESULTS
Background and circumstances, individual motivation, a sense of control, organisational support, and effective networking and information-seeking behaviour were factors identified as contributing to successful transition into, and maintenance of, a strong self-identity as a medical educator.


CONCLUSIONS
The experiences of established medical educators and, in particular, an exploration of the factors that have facilitated their transition to an acknowledged self-identity as a medical educator could assist in supporting new educators to cope with the changes involved in developing as a medical educator.",England,Medical education,29193365,2017,Making the leap to medical education: a qualitative study of medical educators' experiences.,y

To describe what and why nurses self-disclose to patients in mental health care.


BACKGROUND
Self-disclosure is common, but controversial and difficult to delineate. Extant research suggests that self-disclosure might have several potentially beneficial effects on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome for patients in mental health care, but results are often mixed and limited by definitional inconsistencies.


METHOD
Qualitative descriptive study including data from 16 nurses taking part in participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews.


RESULTS
Separate analyses resulted in four themes addressing the research question of what nurses self-disclose, and one main theme and four subthemes addressing why nurses self-disclose. The content of self-disclosure was captured in the four themes: Immediate family, Interests and activities, Life experiences, and Identity. In addition, results showed that disclosures were common among the nurses. Self-disclosure's potential to transform the nurse-patient relationship, making it more open, honest, close, reciprocal and equal, was the overarching reason why nurses shared personal information. The nurses also chose to self-disclose to share existential and everyday sentiments, to give real-life advice, because it felt natural and responsive to patients' question to do so.


CONCLUSION
Nurse self-disclosure is common and covers a variety of personal information. Nurses have several reasons for choosing to self-disclose, most of which are connected to improving the nurse-patient relationship.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE

To evaluate the effects of the implementation of a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings.


BACKGROUND
Care in long-term residential settings for older people is moving away from the biomedical approach and adopting a more person-centred one. Narrative can help shape the way care is planned and organised. The provision of person-centred care that is holistic and that takes account of resident's beliefs and values can be enhanced by incorporating narrative approaches to care within a practice development framework.


DESIGN
The chosen methodology was participatory action research.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2014, a methodological framework of narrative practice was implemented in two residential care settings, comprising 37 residents and 38 staff, using an action research approach. Three action cycles: (i) narrative practice and culture identification, (ii) developing narrative practice and (iii) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation.


RESULTS
Key outcomes emerged in relation to the findings. These were based on narrative being, knowing and doing and centred around the key outcomes of: (i) how people responded to change (narrative being), (ii) the development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and (iii) intentional action (narrative doing).


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a framework of narrative practice demonstrated that how people respond to change, the development of shared understandings and intentional action were interrelated and interlinked. It illustrated the importance of ensuring that practice context is taken account of in the implementation of action research and the importance of ensuring that narrative being, knowing and doing are clear and understandable for change to occur.

The two smaller groups represented different types of poly-victimization-a non-parental and a long-term parental victimization group.

In England and Wales, 'approved premises' offer 24-hour staffed accommodation for high-risk offenders, most of whom are returning to the community from prison. With a move towards a standardised operating model, it is essential to be able to measure outcomes.


AIMS
Our aim is to collate and evaluate 'benchmarks' for approved premises.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to establish the impact of existing practice in all four approved premises in Wales. Data on well-being, life satisfaction, attitudes to violence and problem-solving abilities were recorded with 114 male residents (of 486), and attitudes to personality disorder and personal well-being/burnout with 30 staff (of 86), in both narrative style and according to a number of scales used within criminal justice and healthcare systems. Perceptions of environmental climate were assessed with both groups. Scores were compared with those from reference groups, including prisoners and secure hospital patients. Criminological outcomes (e.g. prison recall) were obtained for all 486 men.


RESULTS
Scores on the scales used were broadly comparable with those in relevant reference groups, but some showed floor or ceiling effects. Recall rates, whether directly from the premises or after further onward movement, were about 42% overall, comparable with those reported for similar offenders elsewhere.

1638,"The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.",England,Journal of sleep research,29193443,2017,A review of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with anxiety.,y
1639,"A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16Â years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents. Key Practitioner Message The adoption status (but not attachment representations) was found to be predictive of externalizing and total behaviour problems, suggesting that attachment itself is not the only variable to take into account in explaining possible maladaptive outcomes in late-adopted adolescents. Nevertheless, disorganized attachment positively predicted internalizing problems, being a risk factor for both adopted and nonadopted adolescents. Only for late-adopted adolescents, higher cognitive reappraisal was negatively related with externalizing problems, suggesting that the functional and positive ability to cognitively restructure negative situations may help them to reduce impulsive negative reactions towards others. Both increasing cognitive reappraisal and decreasing expressive suppression may be considered as valuable goals of therapy with adopted adolescents and their parents. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadopted peers, reported lower somatic complaints, suggesting that they may not allow themselves to show physical vulnerability as consequence of their early affective experiences of severe deprivation. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadoptedÂ ones, reported higher level of expressive suppression strategies, which may be considered as an attempt to beÂ compliant with the environment's requests in order to be loved, accepted, and nurtured.",England,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,29193445,2017,Late-adoptions in adolescence: Can attachment and emotion regulation influence behaviour problems?

The sample comprised 3770 consecutive patients with a mean age of 49.1Â years; 69.7% were male. OSA was diagnosed and categorized based on a standard respiratory polygraphic sleep study using a type 3 portable monitor. Patients completed the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) prior to the sleep study. In addition, they answered questions about whether they were currently in treatment for mental disorders and whether they had been diagnosed previously with depression.

1641,"BACKGROUND
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence following gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recently, more and more attentions are being focused on gut microbiota in brain and behavior. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is considered as a mediator that links the gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Clostridium butyricum (Cb) on brain damage in a mouse model of TBI.


METHODS
Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a model of TBI-induced by weight-drop impact head injury and were treated intragastrically with Cb.Â The cognitive deficits, brain water content, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) in the brain were also measured.Â Moreover, the intestinal barrier permeability, the expression of TJ protein and GLP-1, and IL-6 level in the intestine were detected.


RESULTS
Cb treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, brain edema, neurodegeneration, and BBB impairment. Meanwhile, Cb treatment also significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins (occludin and zonula occluden-1), p-Akt and Bcl-2, but decreased expression of Bax. Moreover, Cb treatment exhibited more prominent effects on decreasing the levels of plasma d-lactate and colonic IL-6, upregulating expression of Occludin, and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, Cb-treatedÂ mice showed increased the secretion of intestinal GLP-1 and upregulated expression of cerebral GLP-1R.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Cb in TBI mice and the involved mechanisms were partially attributed to the elevating GLP-1 secretion through the gut-brain axis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193450,2017,Clostridium butyricum exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury via the gut-brain axis.,y
1642,"In the retina, MÃ¼ller glia have the potential to become progenitor cells with the ability to proliferate and regenerate neurons. However, the ability of MÃ¼ller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) to proliferate and produce neurons is limited in higher vertebrates. Using the chick model system, we investigate how retinoic acid (RA)-signaling influences the proliferation and the formation of MGPCs. We observed an upregulation of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) in the MÃ¼ller glia of damaged retinas where the formation of MGPCs is known to occur. Activation of RA-signaling was stimulated, whereas inhibition suppressed the proliferation of MGPCs in damaged retinas and in fibroblast growth factor 2-treated undamaged retinas. Furthermore, inhibition of RA-degradation stimulated the proliferation of MGPCs. Levels of Pax6, Klf4, and cFos were upregulated in MGPCs by RA agonists and downregulated in MGPCs by RA antagonists. Activation of RA-signaling following MGPC proliferation increased the percentage of progeny that differentiated as neurons. Similarly, the combination of RA and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) significantly increased neurogenesis from retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ).

Validate the Parkinson's disease (PD) composite scale (PDCS).


METHODS
The study included One hundred ninety four PD patients in five countries. Investigators completed the following scales: PDCS, MDS-UPDRS, PDSS-2, MoCA, WOK-19, SEND-PD and CISI-PD. For test-retest analysis, a second administration of the PDCS was carried out in 61 stable patients (as per the CISI-PD) in 7 to 14 days after the first evaluation. The PDCS is a novel scale for PD with a total of 17 items divided in 4 domains: motor, non-motor, treatment complication and disability.


RESULTS
PDCS mean and median values were close. Skewness values were into the criterion limits (-1 to +1). The complete range of scores was covered for 14 of the 17 items (83.4%). Floor effect of 25.26% and 28.25% were observed in the Complication and Disability level dimensions due to the proportion of patients free of these difficulties. No relevant floor or ceiling effect was observed for the PDCS Total Score (1.03% and 0.52%, respectively). The stability of the scale appeared excellent with most items meeting weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.80. The convergent validity of the PDCS with corresponding scores of the MDS-UPDRS showed high correlation values (rS â‰¥0.60). The internal validity was into acceptable limits, with the majority of values higher than the minimal 0.30 threshold. The standard error of measurement suggested a satisfactory precision (SEM=3.81, <30% of the PDCS total score standard deviation).

The PDCS appears to be a feasible, acceptable, reproducible and valid scale. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",England,European journal of neurology,29193455,2017,The Parkinson's Disease Composite Scale: Results of the first validation study.,y
1644,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. The phenotypic expression of the disease may, in part, relate to alterations in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. This resting-state study sought to clarify this in DLB, how networks differed from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether they were related to clinical symptoms in DLB. Resting-state networks were estimated using independent component analysis. We investigated functional connectivity changes in 31 DLB patients compared to 31 healthy controls and a disease comparator group of 29 AD patients using dual regression and FSLNets. Within-network connectivity was generally decreased in DLB compared to controls, mainly in motor, temporal, and frontal networks. Between-network connectivity was mainly intact; only the connection between a frontal and a temporal network showed increased connectivity in DLB. Differences between AD and DLB were subtle and we did not find any significant correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms in DLB. This study emphasizes the importance of reduced connectivity within motor, frontal, and temporal networks in DLB with relative sparing of the default mode network. The lack of significant correlations between connectivity measures and clinical scores indicates that the observed reduced connectivity within these networks might be related to the presence, but not to the severity of motor and cognitive impairment in DLB patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that AD and DLB may show more similarities than differences in patients with mild disease.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193464,2017,Functional connectivity in dementia with Lewy bodies: A within- and between-network analysis.,y
1645,"How does social information affect the perception of taste early in life? Does mere knowledge of other people's food preferences impact children's own experience when eating? In Experiment 1, 5- and 6-year-old children consumed more of a food described as popular with other children than a food that was described as unpopular with other children, even though the two foods were identical. In Experiment 2, children ate more of a food described as popular with children than a food described as popular with adults. Experiment 3 tested whether different perceptual experiences of otherwise identical foods contributed to the mechanisms underlying children's consumption. After sampling both endpoints of a sweet-to-sour range (applesauce with 0 mL or 5mL of lemon juice added), children were asked to taste and categorize applesauce samples with varying amounts of lemon juice added. When classifying ambiguous samples that were near the midpoint of the range (2 mL and 3 mL), children were more likely to categorize popular foods as sweet as compared to unpopular foods. Together, these findings provide evidence that social information plays a powerful role in guiding children's consumption and perception of foods.

To investigate the feasibility of a 13-week mentoring program in providing social support to promote hope for recovery in anorexia nervosa.


BACKGROUND
With no clear first line psychological treatment for people with anorexia nervosa, mentoring support programs, as an adjunct to treatment, may provide the social support necessary to promote hope for recovery.


DESIGN
A mixed method study; Participatory action research.


METHODS
Women (n=11), recovering and who had recovered from anorexia nervosa, participated in the program and completed self-report questionnaires related to quality of life, distress and the mentoring relationship at different time points. Qualitative feedback from logbooks, workshop evaluation questionnaires, interviews and focus groups was also collected to assess the program's acceptability.


RESULTS
General compliance for completing most study outcome questionnaires was 90% however the mentoring relationship questionnaires were not completed to the same degree. Five key themes emerged from the focus group/interview data: 1) She understands me and could relate to me; 2) Re-connecting with the world - Asking questions and being challenged; 3) Mentors' altruistic motivations and the transformation and discovery of self; 4) Instilling hope - Recovery is possible; and 5) Effective communication - The key to successful mentoring.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is needed however the results provide preliminary support for the mentoring program's feasibility as an adjunct to treatment. We found that having someone who understands, to talk and share with, met a clear need for people with anorexia nervosa.

1647,"Stroke patients with motor deficits typically feature enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, also healthy subjects may show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with higher motor demands. Therefore, the question arises to what extent stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural reorganization. We here investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1) but unlike in healthy controls also in contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of right SPL onto affected/left M1 in patients but not in controls when moving the affected/right hand independent of the movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of right SPL was positively coupled with the ""active"" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency. In summary, these findings are compatible with a supportive role of right SPL with respect to motor function of the paretic hand in the reorganized brain.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193484,2017,Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients.,y

In the era of neurological subspecialization, most neurologists will have a field of specialist interest. The aim of this cross-sectional multi-national study was to identify the key areas of interest among trainees or junior specialists, assess the potential influence of an interest in research, and consider the results in light of population needs.


METHODS
A total of 300 residents and junior neurologists who received a bursary to attend the European Academy of Neurology conference were invited to participate in this study. Demographic and work-related characteristics, as well as main subspecialty of choice were examined via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Participants holding a higher degree (PhD/MD) or working in research posts were considered research oriented.


RESULTS
In total, 191 Neurologists in training or junior specialists responded (response rate 63.7%). Full data were available for 187 participants (59.4% females). The study sample had a mean age of 30.5Â±3.4 years (range 25 - 45). The most popular subspecialty was movement disorders (18.2%), followed by multiple sclerosis (11.2%) and epilepsy (10.2%). This did not differ significantly between the participants who were or were not research-oriented.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a potential mismatch between the interests of trainees, and the future needs of the populations they serve, which it is important to identify for workforce planning.

No studies have focused on socioeconomic disparities in obesity within and between cohorts. Our objectives were to examine income gradients in obesity between birth-cohorts (inter-cohort variations) and within each birth-cohort (intra-cohort variations) by gender and race/ethnicity.


METHODS
Our sample includes 56,820 white and black adults from pooled, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1971-2012). We fit a series of logistic hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models to control for the effects of age and period, simultaneously. Predicted probabilities of obesity by poverty-to-income ratio were estimated and graphed for 5-year cohort groups from 1901-1990. We also stratified this relationship for four gender and racial/ethnic subgroups.


RESULTS
Obesity disparities due to income were weaker for post-World War I and II generations, specifically the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s to 1950s cohorts, than for other cohorts. In contrast, we found greater income gradients in obesity among cohorts from the 1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to 1970s. Moreover, obesity disparities due to income across cohorts vary markedly by gender and race/ethnicity. White women with higher income consistently exhibited a lower likelihood of obesity than those with lower income since early 1900s cohorts; whereas, black men with higher income exhibited higher risks of obesity than those with lower income in most cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that strategies that address race and/or gender inequalities in obesity should be cognizant of significant historical factors that may be unique to cohorts. Period-based approaches that ignore life-course experiences captured in significant cohort-based experiences may limit the utility of policies and interventions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193504,2017,Cohort-based income gradients in obesity among U.S. adults.,y

This study proposed and tested a structural model to explain and predict family empowerment in families of children with special needs.


BACKGROUND
Family empowerment of families of children with special needs can be explained using the Double ABCX model. Although constant stressors such as parenting stress and family demands can have negative effects on family empowerment, family resources and parenting efficacy can mediate the negative effect through effective coping strategies.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional research design was employed.


METHODS
A survey was conducted with 240 parents of children with special needs. Upon exclusion of 4 responses deemed inadequate to the statistics process, 236 responses were selected for the analysis. Based on the items used in the previous research, we used the scale of family demands 38, the scale of parenting stress 24, the scale of parenting efficacy 37, the scale of pattern of organization 30, the scale of communication process 16, and the scale of family empowerment 32.


RESULTS
In families of children with special needs, parenting stress had a negative effect on parenting efficacy and family resources, namely, pattern of organization and communication process. Family needs had a positive effect on parenting efficacy. Parenting stress and family demands influenced family empowerment through parenting efficacy and family resources (pattern of organization and communication process), while parenting efficacy contributed to family empowerment.


CONCLUSIONS
This study empirically analyzed the usefulness of the Double ABCX model in predicting family empowerment. Family resource factors (organization pattern and communication process) and perception or judgement factors (such as parenting efficacy) were found to mediate the negative impact of various stressors experienced by families of children with special needs.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study findings suggest that clinical practice and management should focus on providing efficient intervention methods to lower stress in families of children with special needs. Reinforcing factors contributing to family empowerment, such as parenting efficacy, organization pattern, and communication process will alleviate families' stress, resulting in a positive educational and developmental impact on children with special needs.

1652,"Neurogenesis encompasses an entire set of events that leads to the generation of newborn neurons from neural stem cells and more committed progenitor cells, including cell division, the production of migratory precursors and their progeny, differentiation and integration into circuits. In particular, the precise control of neuronal migration and morphological changes is essential for the development of the neocortex. Postmitotic cells within the intermediate zone have been found to transiently assume a characteristic ""multipolar"" morphology, after which a multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs before the cells enter the cortical plate; however, the importance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical cytoarchitecture and the precise genetic control of this phase remains largely unknown. Thus, this review article focuses on the multipolar phase in the developing neocortex. It begins by summarizing the molecular mechanism that underlies multipolar migration for the regulation of each step in multipolar phase in intermediate zone. The physiological significance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical lamination and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with migration defects is then described.",England,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,29193520,2017,Physiological significance of multipolar cells generated from neural stem cells and progenitors for the establishment of neocortical cytoarchitecture.,y

To analyze whether living conditions, experienced by mothers and adult daughters during their childhood, are associated with age at menarche (AAM) in daughters.


METHODS
From September, 2011, to January, 2014, AAM and childhood living conditions were collected from a sample of 246 dyads of Maya mothers (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰59.60 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.64) and their adult daughters (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰33.03 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰5.57) from the cities of Merida and Motul in Yucatan, Mexico. Indicators of childhood living conditions were number of siblings and quality of house construction materials in both generations, and father's absence among daughters in their pre-menarcheal years. Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between childhood conditions in mother-daughter dyads and daughter's AAM.


RESULTS
The recalled mean AAM of adult Maya daughters was 12.05 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.53). After adjusting for the influence of mothers' AAM, number of siblings in both the mothers' and daughters' families directly predicted daughters' AAM (more siblings was associated with a later AAM); and a higher (better) index of household conditions in mothers' childhood was associated with earlier AAM in daughters. The household conditions index during the childhood of daughters and father's absence were not associated with their AAM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that better living conditions experienced by the mothers and daughters during their childhood may lower mean AAM in daughters in the context of populations that show important intergenerational changes in their social and economic conditions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193533,2017,"Living conditions and change in age of menarche in adult Maya mothers and daughters from Yucatan, Mexico.",y
1654,"Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, 'boom-and-bust' demography, hybridization, and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure, and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation, and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C. santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C. santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker, and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses' perspectives of language barriers and their impact on the provision of care to patients with limited English proficiency from diverse linguistic background.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Using individual interviews and focus group discussions, data were collected from 59 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals in England. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.


FINDINGS
Three themes: 'multi-ethnicities and language barriers'; 'the impact of language barriers'; and 'communicating via interpreters', were identified. Communication was identified as the most important aspect of care provision and an essential component of a nurse's professional role regardless of the clinical area or speciality. Language barriers were identified as the biggest obstacles in providing adequate, appropriate, effective and timely care to patients with limited English proficiency. Use of professional interpreters was considered useful; however, the limitations associated with use of interpretation service, including arrangement difficulties, availability and accessibility of interpreters, convenience, confidentiality and privacy related issues and impact on the patient's comfort were mentioned.


CONCLUSION
Language barriers, in any country or setting, can negatively affect nurses' ability to communicate effectively with their patients and thereby have a negative impact on the provision of appropriate, timely, safe and effective care to meet patient's needs.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
An understanding of language barriers can help nurses find appropriate strategies to overcome such barriers and, consequently, enhance the provision of effective care to patients affected by language barriers in any clinical setting in any health care system. The findings of the study has international relevance as language barriers affect health care provision in any country or setting. This article is protected by copyright.

Mentorship of junior faculty is an integral component of career development. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) Young Investigator (YI) Committee designed a mentorship program in 2004 whose purpose was to pair YIs (faculty â‰¤10 years of first academic appointment) with a senior mentor to assist with career development and involvement in COG research activities. This study reports on the committee's ability to achieve these goals.


PROCEDURE
An online survey was sent to YIs who were registered with the program from 2004 to2015, assessing three major domains: (1) overall experience with the mentor pairing, (2) satisfaction with the program, and (3) academic accomplishments of the mentees.


RESULTS
The response rate was 64% (110/171). Overall, YIs rated the success of their mentorship pairing as 7.2 out of 10 (median) (25th, 75th quartile 3.6, 9.6). The direct effects of the mentorship program included 70% YIs reporting a positive effect on their career, 40% reporting any grant or manuscript resulting from the pairing, 47% forming a new research collaboration, and 43% receiving appointment to a COG committee. Respondents reported success in COG with 38% authoring a manuscript on behalf of COG and 65% reporting a leadership position including seven current or past COG discipline chairs and 20 study chairs.

A method of real-time, accurate probe tracking at the entrance of the MRI bore is developed, which, fused with pre-procedural MR images, will enable clinicians to perform cryoablation efficiently in a large workspace with image guidance.


METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) tracking coupled with optical tracking is used to track the probe. EM tracking is achieved with an MRI-safe EM sensor working under the scanner's magnetic field to compensate the line-of-sight issue of optical tracking. Unscented Kalman filter-based probe tracking is developed to smooth the EM sensor measurements when occlusion occurs and to improve the tracking accuracy by fusing the measurements of two sensors.


RESULTS
Experiments with a spine phantom show that the mean targeting errors using the EM sensor alone and using the proposed method are 2.21Â mm and 1.80Â mm, respectively.

To describe sleep patterns in young children with epilepsy and to examine levels of agreement between measurements derived from actigraphy and diary recordings.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHODS
Eighty-nine toddlers and preschool-aged children with epilepsy wore an actigraph on their wrists for 7 consecutive days. Parents and caregivers maintained a concurrent sleep diary while the child was wearing the monitor. Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends.


FINDINGS
Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were Â±35, Â±15, Â±82, Â±70, and Â±29 min, respectively. Differences between actigraphy and diary-derived sleep variables were consistently greater for weekends than for weekdays. Discrepancies between actigraphy and diary-derived actual sleep at night were significantly greater for children who slept alone than for those who co-slept with a parent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates an acceptable agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings for sleep onset, sleep offset, and daytime sleep, but insufficient agreement for actual sleep at night and wake after sleep onset, with parents of children sleeping alone more likely to misestimate child sleep behaviors. Deviation of weekend sleep from weekdays further decreased the accuracy of parental sleep estimates and increased the discrepancies between actigraphy and diary.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on brain magnetic resonance imaging, represent an abnormality related to the development of geriatric syndromes. Recently, it has been found that low sympathetic nervous activity might be associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the severity of cerebral WMH and sympathetic nervous activity, measured by the heart rate variability.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 39 older patients. Holter recording was carried out for 30 min. From the RR intervals on the electrocardiogram, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals, the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in all the five segments of the entire recording, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF were calculated. In regard to the WMH, periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The WMH were also rated semiquantitatively according to the methods developed by Junque (periventricular hyperintensities) and de Groot (DWMH).


RESULTS
The LF/HF showed significant negative correlations with the total and regional periventricular hyperintensities, as well as DWMH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the negative associations remained significant between the LF/HF and DWMH (total, temporal, occipital). Furthermore, fall risk index significantly correlated with the LF/HF, total and the occipital DWMH.


CONCLUSIONS
The severity of the DWMH was associated with the LF/HF and the fall risk, one of the important geriatric syndromes, suggesting that WMH, sympathetic nervous dysfunction and geriatric syndrome are interrelated to each other.

Displacement is traumatic and often an unwanted social change that can lead to a loss of identity and socioeconomic, physical, and psychological livelihood. The purpose of the study was to describe the association of perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness to depressive symptom severity in Palestinian refugees, taking into consideration gender and poverty.


DESIGN
The descriptive, correlational study was framed within a socioecological lens. Data collection occurred between October 2015 and November 2015 in Amman, Jordan, which hosts the most Palestinian refugees in the world. The participants in the sample (N = 177) had a mean age of 36.9 years.


METHODS
Participants responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptom severity, the RAND-36 perceived health item, and a statement about hopefulness to return to Palestine. Descriptive, correlation, and logistic and linear regression analyses were computed.


FINDINGS
Results showed that 43% of participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 42% lived in poverty, and 20% had fair or poor health; yet, 60% were hopeful about returning to Palestine. Participants who had better perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness were less likely to have symptoms of major depression. Perceived health was the only factor-not gender, poverty, or right-of-return hopefulness-that explained the variance in depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Palestinian adult refugees in Jordan exhibited symptoms of major depression that were associated with poorer perceived health and less hopefulness about repatriation to Palestine.

A total of 460 participants aged 60-95â€‰years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index - Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities.


RESULTS
The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), homemaking/maintenance (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and traveling (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index - Z for older adults.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates. The current study suggests marketing and programming plans to overcome the constraints that influence older adults' life satisfaction.

1666,"Recent studies have used results on SNP association with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to create polygenic risk scores (PRS) discriminating non-familial unrelated patients from controls. Little is known about the role of PRS in densely affected multigenerational families. We tested PRS differences between affected SZ and BD family members from their non-affected adult relatives (NAARs) in Eastern Quebec Kindreds and from controls. We examined 1227 subjects: from 17 SZ and BD kindreds, we studied 153 patients (57 SZ, 13 schizoaffective, and 83 BD) and 180 NAARs, and 894 unrelated controls from the Eastern Quebec population. PRS were derived from published case-control association studies of SZ and BD. We also constructed a combined SZ and BD PRS by using SNPs from both SZ and BD PRS. SZ patients had higher SZ PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0039, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027) and BD patients had higher BD PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027). Differences between affected subjects and NAARs and controls were significant with both SZ and BD PRS. Moreover, a combined SZ-BD PRS was also significantly associated with SZ and BD when compared to NAARs (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0019, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.010) and controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0025, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.028), revealing a SZ-BD commonality effect in PRS at the diagnosis level.

Dietary cholesterol has been shown to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed that oxysterol especially 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) may play a potential role in Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) production and accumulation during AD progression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To investigate the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol and 27-OHC on learning and memory impairment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with cholesterol diet with or without 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole) injection. We determined the levels of cholesterol, 27-OHC, 24S-OHC, 7Î±-OHC and 7Î²-OHC in plasma; ApoA, ApoB, HDL-C and LDL-C in plasma or brain; CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in liver and CYP46A1 and CYP7B1 in brain; cathepsin B, cathepsin D and acid phosphatase in lysosome; AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 in brain. Results showed increased levels of 27-OHC (PÂ <Â 0.01), LDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.01), ApoB (PÂ <Â 0.01) and decreased level of HDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.05) in plasma, upregulated CYP27A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) and CYP7A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) expression in liver, altered lysosomal function and increased level of AÎ² in brain (PÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
This study indicated that the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol on learning and memory impairment may be involved in cholesterol metabolism and lysosome function with the increase of plasma 27-OHC, thus resulting in AÎ² formation and accumulation.

1668,"Recent studies showed cultural worldviews are a key determinant of environmental risk perceptions; thus, they could influence climate change adaptation strategies. African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45 % of agro-pastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a compliment to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation.

Strengthening neighborhood social networks is important for promoting health among older adults. However, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing older adults' social networks have not yet been established. The present study examined whether a university-led community intervention that provided communication opportunities could increase older Japanese adults' neighborhood social networks.


METHODS
The present study used a quasi-experimental design. Before the intervention, using postal mail, we carried out a baseline questionnaire survey that was sent to all people living in the Tsurukabuto community aged â‰¥60â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰1769), of whom 1068 responded. For the community intervention, 18 event-based programs were provided over the course of 1â€‰year at Kobe University. Academic staff at Kobe University organized all the programs. During the program, social interactions among participants were promoted. A follow-up survey was distributed to those who responded to the baseline survey, and 710 individuals answered the question about their participation in the intervention programs (138 respondents were participants, 572 were non-participants). The neighborhood social network was measured in both the baseline and follow-up surveys.


RESULTS
Analysis of covariance showed that the changes in neighborhood social network among participants in the program was significantly higher than the changes among non-participants (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046) after adjusting for the baseline score of social network.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study found that participants of the intervention expanded their neighborhood social network, but non-participants did not.

1670,"Neural crest cells (NCC) can migrate into different parts of the body and express their strong inductive potential. In addition, they are multipotent and are able to differentiate into various cell types with diverse functions. In the primitive gut, NCC induce differentiation of muscular structures and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and they themselves differentiate into the elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), neurons and glial cells. ICC develop by way of mesenchymal cell differentiation in the outer parts of the primitive gut wall around the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia, with the exception of colon, where they appear simultaneously also at the submucosal border of the circular muscular layer around the submucosal plexus (SMP) ganglia. However, in a complex process of reciprocal induction of NCC and local mesenchyma, c-kit positive precursors are the first to differentiate, representing probably the common precursors of ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). C-kit positive precursors could represent a key impact factor regarding the final differentiation of NCC into neurons and glial cells with neurons subsequently excreting stem cell factor (SCF) and other signalling molecules. Under the impact of SCF, a portion of c-kit positive precursors lying immediately around the ganglia differentiate into ICC, while the rest differentiate into SMC.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193736,2017,Development of interstitial cells of Cajal in the human digestive tract as the result of reciprocal induction of mesenchymal and neural crest cells.,y
1671,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A. The simplest complete model of choice response time: linear ballistic accumulation. Cogn Psychol 2008, 57:153-178).

1672,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multi-arm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of LGMs, how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model in order to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network. A publicly available R package, nmaINLA, is developed to automate the INLA implementation of NMA models which are considered in this paper. Three applications illustrate the use of INLA for a NMA.",England,Research synthesis methods,29193801,2017,A design-by-treatment interaction model for network meta-analysis and meta-regression with integrated nested Laplace approximations.,y
1673,"Social communication impairments are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and this class of symptoms is a target for treatments for the disorder. Measures of social attention, assessed via eye-gaze tracking (EGT), have been proposed as an early efficacy biomarker for clinical trials targeting social communication skills. EGT measures have been shown to differentiate children with ASD from typical children; however, there is less known about their relationships with social communication outcome measures that are typically used in ASD clinical trials. In the present study, an EGT task involving viewing a videotape of an actor making bids for a child's attention was evaluated in 25 children with ASD aged 24-72 months. Children's attention to the actor during the dyadic bid condition measured via EGT was found to be strongly associated with five well-validated caregiver-reported outcome measures that are commonly used to assess social communication in clinical trials. These results highlight the convergent validity of EGT measures of social attention in relation to caregiver-reported clinical measures. EGT holds promise as a non-invasive, quantitative, and objective biomarker that is associated with social communication abilities in children with ASD. Autism Res 2017,.

1674,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in which reduced social interest is a common symptom, such as autism, depression, and anxiety, are frequently associated with genetic mutations affecting GABAergic transmission. Benzodiazepine treatment, acting via GABAA receptors, improves social interaction in male mouse models with autism-like features. The protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) can act as an endogenous benzodiazepine, but a role for DBI in social behavior has not been described. Here we investigated the role of DBI in the social interest and recognition behavior of mice. The responses of DBI wild-type and knockout male and female mice to ovariectomized female wild-type mice (a neutral social stimulus) were evaluated in a habituation/dishabituation task. Both male and female knockout mice exhibited reduced social interest, and DBI knockout mice lacked the sex difference in social interest levels observed in wild-type mice, in which males showed higher social interest levels than females. The ability to discriminate between familiar and novel stimulus mice (social recognition) was not impaired in DBI-deficient mice of either sex. DBI knockouts could learn a rotarod motor task, and could discriminate between social and non-social odors. Both sexes of DBI knockout mice showed increased repetitive grooming behavior, but not in a manner that would account for the decrease in social investigation time. Genetic loss of DBI did not alter seminal vesicle weight, indicating that the social interest phenotype of males lacking DBI is not due to reduced circulating testosterone. Together, these studies reveal a novel role of DBI in driving social interest and motivation.",England,"Genes, brain, and behavior",29193847,2017,Genetic loss of diazepam binding inhibitor in mice impairs social interest.,y

1676,"Currently, the predominant hypothesis explains cellular differentiation and behaviour as an essentially genetically driven intracellular process, suggesting a gene-centrism paradigm. However, although many living species genetic has now been described, there is still a large gap between the genetic information interpretation and cell behaviour prediction. Indeed, the physical mechanisms underlying the cell differentiation and proliferation, which are now known or suspected to guide such as the flow of energy through cells and tissues, have been often overlooked. We thus here propose a complementary conceptual framework towards the development of an energy-oriented classification of cell properties, that is, a mitochondria-centrism hypothesis based on physical forces-driven principles. A literature review on the physical-biological interactions in a number of various biological processes is analysed from the point of view of the fluid and solid mechanics, electricity and thermodynamics. There is consistent evidence that physical forces control cell proliferation and differentiation. We propose that physical forces interfere with the cell metabolism mostly at the level of the mitochondria, which in turn control gene expression.

1678,"Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date there are limited options for treating this core symptomology. Treatments that stimulate adenosine A2A receptors may represent a promising approach for reducing RRBs in ASD. This is because A2A receptors are expressed on striatal neurons of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Under activation of this pathway has been associated with RRBs while activation of A2A receptors leads to increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway. The present studies investigated whether acute, systemic treatment with CGS21680, an A2A receptor agonist attenuates elevated self-grooming and a probabilistic reversal learning deficit in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf /J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism. The effects of this treatment were also investigated in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as a comparison strain. Using a spatial reversal learning test with 80/20 probabilistic feedback, comparable to one in which ASD individuals exhibit deficits, CGS 21680 (0.005 and 0.01mg/kg) attenuated a reversal learning deficit in BTBR mice. Enhancement in probabilistic reversal learning performance resulted from CGS 21680 improving the consistent maintenance of new adaptive behavioral choice patterns after reversal. CGS 21680 at 0.01 mg, but not 0.005 mg, also reduced self-grooming behavior in BTBR mice. CGS 21680 did not affect self-grooming or reversal learning in B6 mice. These findings demonstrate that A2A receptor agonists may be a promising receptor target in the treatment of RRBs in ASD. Autism Res 2017,.

1679,"OBJECTIVE
A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment. The authors have developed software through which students can experience the practice of psychiatry (in particular, with dementia patients) in its entirety. This study compares this software with conventional learning methods.


METHOD
The control group was 43 fifth-year medical students in 2014 who studied using a conventional learning method (taking lectures and being in contact with actual patients). The experimental group was 36 fifth-year medical students in 2015 that used computer software (taking lectures and with reduced time in contact with actual patients). The authors compared the two groups. Each group was tested before and after clinical training on their acquisition of knowledge of dementia. The control group was tested in 2014, and the experimental group was tested in 2015.


RESULTS
The difference in average test scores between the two groups was statistically significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), with the experimental group scoring higher.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that students who were taught using a computer-based software method were better able to answer a standard series of questions designed to evaluate their understanding of dementia than those who were taught in a conventional manner.

They have defined themselves as human beings as opposed to animals and things, on account of characteristics that they regarded as essential. However it now seems necessary to question this perception of humanity and the human condition.Indeed, longer life expectancy together with its related pathologies and medical progress lead us to think differently. Today we realise that those qualities which were thought to belong specifically to human beings, such as awareness, reason, memory and free will, can disappear. Should we conclude then that those whose capacities have decreased or disappeared have become less human or have even lost all human qualities?Such questioning leads to new ways of describing humans whereby they would be defined not in substantial but rather in interpersonal terms.Surely being a person means first and foremost that we live through and for others.

Field notes generated through observations were transcribed and analysed to identify emerging themes. The findings revealed three predominant themes which illustrate the potential of motion-based technology as a group activity for people with dementia who attend adult day programmes: (a) the importance of having a trained trainer, (b) learning versus mastery and (c) playing 'independently together'. People with dementia can learn to play games presented on motion-based technology and enjoy doing so.

1687,"Background Apathy is prominent in persons with dementia and apathy assessment is challenging. It remains unclear who should conduct apathy assessments in long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). Methods This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant, and one licensed practical nurse or activity staff. Family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff rated the resident's apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results The results revealed that ratings conducted by certified nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (râ€‰=â€‰0.47, pâ€‰=â€‰.08). None of the other AES ratings among family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were significantly correlated.

1688,"The acute hospital admission of patients with dementia is associated with poor outcome and higher costs. Much of our knowledge on how hospital stays are experienced by patients and staff is generated from short and fragmented data collections, in which the significance of knowledge about day-to-day care might be overlooked, and might partly explain why the poor outcome for this group of patients is not fully understood. This study used participant observation to follow patients with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards after fall incidents. To gather longitudinal data, patients were followed during day and evening shifts, from admission to discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The data showed that, despite having little specific knowledge about dementia care, staff were able to gather information about the patient's needs and wishes relevant to administrating medicine in a person-centred way. However, much of this valuable information was lost between shifts or became hidden among the overwhelming amount of information in electronic patient records. As a consequence, much of the knowledge about individual patients' needs and wishes had to be collected all over again at every shift. The study concludes that careful handover of information on person-centred dementia care can play an important role in making hospital stays more dementia-friendly.",England,"Dementia (London, England)",29192513,2017,Medication and care in Alzheimer's patients in the acute care setting: A qualitative analysis.,y

To analyze the impact of measures undertaken to control brucellosis in the Republic of Macedonia on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the disease in humans.


METHODS
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients with brucellosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated at the University Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje during three time periods: 1989-1990 when no national strategy for disease control existed, 2000-2001 when some activities for control were performed and 2011-2014 when an organized and financially supported strategy was accomplished.


RESULTS
A drastic decrease of the number of cases of human brucellosis during the last period when compared to the first two ones (3.9 and 3.3 times lower, respectively) was evident. Patients from the third period were significantly older, with median age 41 years (range 4-73) vs. 31 years (3-77) and 34 years (1-74), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰.013). There were more males (86.6 vs. 73.6% and 63.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and the disease was more often acquired professionally (80.6 vs. 60.1% and 59.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.006).

1694,"BACKGROUND
Patients with brain lesions and resultant chronic aphasia frequently suffer from depression. However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial).


METHODS
In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test).


RESULTS
Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192534,2017,Intensive Communicative Therapy Reduces Symptoms of Depression in Chronic Nonfluent Aphasia.,y

Patients with neglect ignore or respond slower to contralesional stimuli. Neglect negatively influences independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most frequently studied treatments, yet there is little evidence regarding positive effects on neglect behavior in ADL.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether PA in the subacute phase ameliorates neglect in situations of varying complexity.


METHODS
A total of 70 neglect patients admitted for inpatient stroke rehabilitation received either PA or sham adaptation (SA) for 2 weeks, with full access to standard treatment. There were 7 time-dependent measurements (baseline and 1-4, 6, and 14 weeks after start of treatment). The primary outcome was change of neglect as observed during basic ADL with the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in performance on a dynamic multitask (ie, the Mobility Assessment Course [MAC]) and a static paper-and-pencil task (ie, a shape cancellation task [SC]).


RESULTS
In all, 34 patients received PA and 35 SA. There were significant time-dependent improvements in performance as measured with the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F > 15.57; P < .001). There was no significant difference in magnitude of improvement between groups on the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F < 2.54; P > .113].


CONCLUSIONS
No beneficial effects of PA over SA in the subacute phase poststroke were observed, which was comparable for situations of varying complexity. Heterogeneity of the syndrome, time post-stroke onset, and the content of treatment as usual are discussed.

To examine changes in breastfeeding rates in 0 to 6 month old infants in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, over the period from 2009 to 2015, for the total population as well as for various ethnic groups.

METHOD
Breastfeeding rates were examined for the period from 2009 to 2015 in 165,420 registrations of 75,543 infants at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for the entire Amsterdam population and for various ethnic groups. Differences were analysed using Ï‡2 tests.


RESULTS
The weighted percentage of total breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding as well as a combination of breast and formula feeding) increased in the entire Amsterdam study population over the period from 2009 to 2015 (2 weeks: 87.8% to 89.1%; 3 months: 61.6% to 63.6%; 6 months: 39.5% to 42.2%). Increases were mainly the result of increases in weighted percentages for exclusive breastfeeding.

CONCLUSION
Percentages for total breastfeeding as well as exclusive breastfeeding in Amsterdam rose over the period from 2009 to 2015, but there is room for improvement.

Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic influences on diurnal preference have exclusively included subjects of European ancestry. This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs. Genetic risk score (GRS) profiling detected shared genetic risk between evening preference and related disorders. Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012.

1704,"OBJECTIVE
Regenerated peripheral nervous tissue possesses different morphometric properties compared to undisrupted nerve. It is poorly understood how these morphometric differences alter the response of the regenerated nerve to electrical stimulation. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the electrophysiological response of regenerated and undisrupted nerve axons to electrical stimulation delivered by macro-sieve electrodes (MSEs).


APPROACH
A 3D finite element model of a peripheral nerve segment populated with mammalian myelinated axons and implanted with a macro-sieve electrode has been developed. Fiber diameters and morphometric characteristics representative of undisrupted or regenerated peripheral nervous tissue were assigned to core conductor models to simulate the two tissue types. Simulations were carried out to quantify differences in thresholds and chronaxie between undisrupted and regenerated fiber populations. The model was also used to determine the influence of axonal caliber on recruitment thresholds for the two tissue types. Model accuracy was assessed through comparisons with in-vivo recruitment data from chronically implanted MSEs.


MAIN RESULTS
Recruitment thresholds of individual regenerated fibers with diameters &gt;2 Âµm were found to be lower compared to same caliber undisrupted fibers at electrode to fiber distances of less than about 90-140 Âµm but roughly equal or higher for larger distances. Caliber redistributions observed in regenerated nerve resulted in an overall increase in average recruitment thresholds and chronaxie during whole nerve stimulation. Modeling results also suggest that large diameter undisrupted fibers located close to a longitudinally restricted current source such as the MSE have higher average recruitment thresholds compared to small diameter fibers. In contrast, large diameter regenerated nerve fibers located in close proximity of MSE sites have, on average, lower recruitment thresholds compared to small fibers. Utilizing regenerated fiber morphometry and caliber distributions resulted in accurate predictions of in-vivo recruitment data.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our work uses computational modeling to show how morphometric differences between regenerated and undisrupted tissue results in recruitment threshold discrepancies, quantifies these differences, and illustrates how large undisrupted nerve fibers close to longitudinally restricted current sources have higher recruitment thresholds compared to adjacently positioned smaller fibers while the opposite is true for large regenerated fibers.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192607,2017,Modelling the impact of altered axonal morphometry on the response of regenerative nervous tissue to electrical stimulation through macro-sieve electrodes.,y
1705,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this work is to improve the state of the art for motor-control with a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs use neurological recording devices and a decoding algorithms to transform brain activity directly into real-time control of a machine, archetypically a robotic arm or a cursor. The standard procedure treats neural activity--vectors of spike counts in small temporal windows--as noisy observations of the kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration) of the fingertip. Inferring the state from the observations then takes the form of a \emph{dynamical filter}, typically some variant on Kalman's (KF). The KF, however, although fairly robust in practice, is optimal only when the relationships between variables are linear and the noise is Gaussian, conditions usually violated in practice.


APPROACH
To overcome these limitations we introduce a new filter, the ""recurrent exponential-family harmonium"" (rEFH), that models the spike counts explicitly as Poisson-distributed, and allows for arbitrary nonlinear dynamics and observation models. Furthermore, the model underlying the filter is acquired through unsupervised learning, which allows temporal correlations in spike counts to be explained by latent dynamics that do not necessarily correspond to the kinematic state of the fingertip.


MAIN RESULTS
We test the rEFH on offline reconstruction of the kinematics of reaches in the plane. The rEFH outperforms the standard, as well as three other state-of-the-art, decoders, across three monkeys, two different tasks, most kinematic variables, and a range of bin widths, amounts of training data, and numbers of neurons.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our algorithm establishes a new state of the art for offline decoding of reaches---in particular, for fingertip velocities, the variable used for control in most online decoders.&#13.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192609,2017,"Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm.",y

This study examines the use of the number of night-time sleep disturbances as a health-based metric to assess the cost effectiveness of rail noise mitigation strategies for situations, wherein high-intensity noises dominate such as freight train pass-bys and wheel squeal.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty residential properties adjacent to the existing and proposed rail tracks in a noise catchment area of the Epping to Thornleigh Third Track project were used as a case study. Awakening probabilities were calculated for individual's awakening 1, 3 and 5 times a night when subjected to 10 independent freight train pass-by noise events using internal maximum sound pressure levels (LAFmax).


RESULTS
Awakenings were predicted using a random intercept multivariate logistic regression model. With source mitigation in place, the majority of the residents were still predicted to be awoken at least once per night (median 88.0%), although substantial reductions in the median probabilities of awakening three and five times per night from 50.9 to 29.4% and 9.2 to 2.7%, respectively, were predicted. This resulted in a cost-effective estimate of 7.6-8.8 less people being awoken at least three times per night per A$1 million spent on noise barriers.


CONCLUSION
The study demonstrates that an easily understood metric can be readily used to assist making decisions related to noise mitigation for large-scale transport projects.",India,Noise & health,29192613,2017,A Health-Based Metric for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Noise Barrier Mitigation Associated With Transport Infrastructure Noise.,y
1708,"CONTEXT
According to the attention restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors.


AIMS
By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50-min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40â€‰min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were re-tested. The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately re-tested. The difference between the two test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents the attention restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig.â€‰=â€‰0.027 (<0.050)].


RESULTS
The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95%) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8.4), 'traffic sounds group' (2.4) and 'machine sounds group' (-1.8).


CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, have a positive effect on the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration.",India,Noise & health,29192615,2017,Effects of Soundscape on the Environmental Restoration in Urban Natural Environments.,y

Hyperacusis is defined as a reduction in tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Hyperacusis can occur in individuals of all age groups, making daily life difficult for the sufferers. Although there is no objective test to accurately diagnose hyperacusis, questionnaires are useful for the assessment of hyperacusis. The aim of this study was to explore the reduced sound tolerance in university students using a hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 536 university students (300 females and 236 males) aged between 18 and 25 years, with a mean age of 21.34â€‰Â±â€‰1.87 years, were assessed using an HQ developed by Khalfa. The mean total score of all the participants was 16.34â€‰Â±â€‰7.91, and 5.78% of the participants had total scores indicating hyperacusis, where a majority of them were females.


RESULTS
Females had significantly higher scores than men in terms of both the total and the attentional and emotional dimensions. The scores of the participants who reported noise exposure or a decrease in their tolerance to noise were significantly higher than those of the other participants. Even among young adults, there was a group of participants suffering from some problems related to decreased tolerance to everyday sounds.


DISCUSSION
Although the Turkish translation of the HQ seems to be a reliable tool for evaluating hyperacusis in young adults, further work with various populations of different age groups is required to establish validity and to assess the psychometric qualities of the Turkish form.",India,Noise & health,29192616,2017,Assessment of Reduced Tolerance to Sound (Hyperacusis) in University Students.,y
1710,"OBJECTIVE
Children's own ratings and opinions on their schools sound environments add important information on noise sources. They can also provide information on how to further improve and optimize children's learning situation in their classrooms. This study reports on the Swedish translation and application of an evidence-based questionnaire that measures how children perceive the acoustic environment of their school.


STUDY DESIGN
The Swedish version was made using a back-to-back translation. Responses on the questionnaire along with demographic data were collected for 149 children aged 9-13 years of age.


RESULTS
The Swedish translation of the questionnaire can be reduced from 93 to 27 items. The 27 items were distributed over five separate factors measuring different underlying constructs with high internal consistency and high inter-item correlations. The responses demonstrated that the dining hall/canteen and the corridors are the school spaces with the poorest listening conditions. The highest annoyance was reported for tests and reading; next, student-generated sounds occur more frequently within the classroom than any sudden unexpected sounds, and finally, road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms are the most frequently occurring sounds from outside the classroom. Several demographic characteristics could be used to predict the outcome on these factors.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that crowded spaces are most challenging; the children themselves generate most of the noise inside the classroom, but it is also common to hear road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms. The extent of annoyance that noise causes depends on the task but seems most detrimental in tasks, wherein the demands of verbal processing are higher.

Two hundred and seven (94%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4%) had serum glucose> 7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2%) had body mass index <25.0 while 6.8% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day.


CONCLUSION
Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192627,2017,Behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes mellitus among newly admitted undergraduates in a Nigerian University.,y

Seizures are common reasons for neurologic consultations and investigations. In the absence of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scanning of the brain is a reliable and cheaper alternative. Little is known about the pattern of brain lesions in patients with recurrent seizures in Nigeria.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the pattern of significant intracerebral lesions in patients presenting with recurrent seizures in a tertiary hospital in Enugu.


METHODS
All the medical and computer tomography records of patients with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent seizures were reviewed. The study duration was 11 years (January 2003 to December 2013). Relevant data were obtained and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 and GraphPad Prism 6.


RESULTS
The diagnostic yield of CT was 55.1%. Twenty (9.3%) individuals had two lesions each. The significant findings were tumors (20.4%), encephalomalacia (18.9%) and strokes (7.7% (ischemic stroke, 4.1%, intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.1%, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.5%). Hydrocephalus (HCP) was found in 18 (9.2%) cases, and 30% of them occurred together with other lesions. The diagnostic yield increased with age reaching 84.4% from the age of 60 years. Only patients with encephalomalacia were statistically older than those with normal imaging.


CONCLUSION
Computed tomography scan has a high diagnostic yield, especially in elderly patients with recurrent generalized seizures. Brain tumors, encephalomalacia, and HCP are most common causes of recurrent seizures in the adults.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192634,2017,"The Pattern of significant lesions found in computerized tomography scan of recurrent seizure patients at a center in Enugu, Nigeria.",y
1713,"BACKGROUND
Obesity can lead to psychological, social, and medical problems that may negatively affect the quality of life Aim: In our study, we aimed to evaluate the body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life of obese subjects in comparison with normal weighted ones.


METHODS
A total of 494 subjects, aged between 18 and 64 years, were included to the study. Patients with the body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥18.5-24.9 kg/m2 were assigned to the control group; BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 were assigned to the obese patient group. An ethical committee approval with protocol No. of 2011/242 was obtained from the Ethical Committee of EskiÅŸehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine. Interviews were performed two times with obese subjects in the 1st and the 6th month of weight loss program, once with the control group. Data identification form, the form which included the biochemical parameters, Trait Anxiety inventory, State anxiety scale, Quality of Life scale-Short Form [(SF-36)(QOL)], Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), Zung Depression Rating Scale, and Zung Anxiety Rating Scale were applied to participants.


RESULTS
Obesity is more common in women. Obesity reduces the quality of life, negatively affects body perception, and triggers anxiety. Because of their body structure, obese individuals are exposed to social pressure and unethical attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Both health risks and social implications of obesity are important. Further studies are needed to ethically evaluate the psycho-social problems caused by obesity.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192636,2017,"Assessment of body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life among obese and nonobese subjects in Turkey.",y

This review aimed to explore the most contemporary evidence on whether poor oral health and dementia occurs in the same individuals or populations, to outline the nature of the relationship between these two health outcomes and to discuss the implication of any findings for health services and future research. The review was undertaken by a working group comprising consultant clinicians from medicine and dentistry, trainees, public health and academic staff. Whilst other rapid reviews in the current series limited their search to systematic reviews, this review focused on primary research involving cohort and case-control studies because of the lack of high level evidence in this new and important field. The results suggest that poor oral hygiene is associated with dementia, and more so amongst people in advanced stages of the disease. Suboptimal oral health (gingivitis, dental caries, tooth loss, edentulousness) appears to be associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.

We investigated the understanding of terminology commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine clinics.Methods We investigated patients' understanding using a questionnaire-based study in the out-patient setting. Age, gender, first language and highest educational level were recorded. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions regarding patients' understanding of words as well as asking patients to define certain terms. Vocabulary included 'ulcer', 'blister', 'cancer', 'malignant' and 'benign'.Results and conclusions Many patients have difficulty in understanding and explaining commonly used terminology. 'Blister' was the most commonly understood term, while 'benign' and 'lesion' were the least well understood. 'Tumour' was mistakenly thought of as synonymous with 'malignancy' by over a third of patients. Understanding was better among those for whom English was their first language. It is essential that all clinicians modify their language appropriately during consultations in order to deliver information in a comprehensive manner, to educate patients on their condition thus enabling informed decision making by patients.",England,British dental journal,29192691,2017,Patient understanding of commonly used oral medicine terminology.,y

Perinatal loss (stillbirth or early infant death) is often a sudden, unexpected event for families. We evaluated who communicates the loss to the parents and who is there for support at the delivery or death.


STUDY DESIGN

RESULTS
We had a 44% response rate at 9 months after birth or loss from 377 bereaved mothers and 232 with surviving infants. Bereaved women were less likely to have hospital staff or family members present at delivery. African-American (versus Caucasian) mothers were half as likely to have first heard about their stillbirth from a physician or midwife.

Although incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms appears to be a barrier to successful self-care, there are few studies examining the relationship between self-care and levels of comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.


AIM
To determine whether incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms is associated with self-care in heart failure patients who were recently discharged from the hospital due to heart failure exacerbation.


METHODS
Patients completed the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale and questionnaire to assess knowledge of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Three groups were formed by their different levels of understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether these three levels of understanding groups predicted self-care after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.


RESULTS
Of 571 patients 22.1%, 40.1% and 37.8% had poor, moderate, and complete understanding, respectively. Compared with patients in the poor understanding group, patients in complete and moderate understanding groups were more likely to have better adherence to self-care activities (standardized Î² = -0.14, 95% confidence interval -3.41, -0.47; standardized Î² = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -4.26, -1.23, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS

To maximise the benefits obtainable from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, an evaluation of physical fitness using reliable, clinically relevant tests is strongly recommended. Recently, objective tests of physical fitness have been implemented in the SWEDEHEART register. The reliability of these tests has, however, not been examined for patients with acute coronary syndrome.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of the symptom-limited bicycle ergometer test, the dynamic unilateral heel-lift test and the unilateral shoulder-flexion test in patients with acute coronary syndrome.


METHODS
In a longitudinal study design, a total of 40 patients (mean age 63.8 Â± 9.5 years, five women), with ACS, aged < 75 years, were included at a university hospital in Sweden. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval, standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsiveness in terms of the minimal detectable change were calculated.


RESULTS
Excellent reliability was found, showing ICC values of 0.98 (0.96-0.99), SEM 4.71 for the bicycle ergometer test, ICC 0.87 (0.75-0.93), SEM 4.62 for the shoulder-flexion test and ICC 0.84 (0.71-0.91), SEM 2.24 for the heel-lift test. The minimal detectable change was 13 W, 13 and 6 repetitions for the bicycle ergometer test, shoulder-flexion and heel-lift tests respectively.

The ILFAS was developed using methodologies and principles from Lean/Shingo, IPCP, metacognition research and Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains. A panel of experts confirmed the initial face validity of the instrument. Researchers independently assessed five facilitators, during six Lean sessions. Analysis included quantitative evaluation of rater agreement. Overall inter-rater agreement of the assessment of facilitator performance was high (92%), and discrepancies in the agreement statistics were analysed. Face and content validity were further established, and usability was evaluated, through primary stakeholder post-pilot feedback, uncovering minor concerns, leading to tool revision.

1726,"Introduction Hypertension is one of the primary modifiable risk factors for cardiac and renal diseases. The prevalence of hypertension appears to be around 30-45% of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The administration of blood pressure-lowering drugs is to reduce the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes: stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths. Hypertension guidelines recommend combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk and with subclinical organ damage as well as when monotherapy fails. Areas covered As the etiology of essential hypertension is multifactorial, combination therapy using different classes of antihypertensive agents have greater effect than each on its own (synergistic effect), may have better tolerability (two components minimizing each other's side effects) and lead to improved patient compliance. Several studies assess the hypotensive efficacy on drug combination, there are also studies n triple drug combination. Expert commentary At present, dual and triple combination therapy is available to hypertensive patients with good clinical outcomes, compliance and low profile of side effects. Hypertensive patients usually have other cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. As patients' adherence to the pharmacological therapy significantly decreases the risk of long-term adverse events including mortality, use of single-pill combination therapy are not only good effects of free therapy but also better patient compliance. It appears that combinations not only of hypotensive drugs but also with statins will be widely used.

1728,"OBJECTIVE
This study A) assessed whether levels of alcohol-related disciplinary actions on college campuses changed among MD college students after the 2011 Maryland (MD) state alcohol tax increase from 6% to 9%, and B) determined which school-level factors impacted the magnitude of changes detected.


METHOD
A quasi-experimental interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of panel data containing alcohol-related disciplinary actions on 33 MD college campuses in years 2006-2013. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in counts of alcohol-related disciplinary actions comparing time before and after the tax increase.


RESULTS
The ITS anaysis showed an insignificant relationship between alcohol-related disciplinary actions and tax implementation (Î² = -.27; p =.257) but indicated that alcohol-related disciplinary actions decreased significantly over the time under study (Î² = -.05; p =.022).


DISCUSSION
Alcohol related disciplinary actions did decrease over time in the years of study, and this relationship was correlated with several school-level characteristics, including school price, school funding type, types of degrees awarded, and specialty.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques.


METHODS
Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6Â mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28Â days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations.


RESULTS
FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions. Vitamin D has positive effects on the hormonal and structural changes observed in PCOS, but it has been concluded that long-term use may be more beneficial.",England,Ultrastructural pathology,29192811,2017,Effects of vitamin D on ovary in DHEA-treated PCOS rat model: A light and electron microscopic study.,y
1730,"Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths.

1733,The amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insights into AÎ²-interacting proteins are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity. We recently undertook an in-depth in vitro interrogation of the AÎ²1-42 interactome using human frontal lobes as the biological source material and taking advantage of advances in mass spectrometry performance characteristics. These analyses uncovered the small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) to be the most selectively enriched binder to oligomeric AÎ²1-42. Subsequent validation experiments revealed that SST interferes with AÎ² fibrillization and promotes the formation of AÎ² assemblies characterized by a 50-60Â kDa SDS-resistant core. The distributions of SST and AÎ² overlap in the brain and SST has been linked to AD by several additional observations. This perspective summarizes this body of literature and draws attention to the fact that SST is one of several neuropeptide hormones that acquire amyloid properties before their synaptic release. The latter places the interaction between SST and AÎ² among an increasing number of observations that attest to the ability of amyloidogenic proteins to influence each other. A model is presented which attempts to reconcile existing data on the involvement of SST in the AD etiology.,United States,Prion,29192843,2017,Somatostatin in Alzheimer'S disease: A new Role for an Old Player.,y

1735,"OBJECTIVE The acquisition and refinement of cognitive and behavioral skills during development is associated with the maturation of various brain oscillatory activities. Most developmental investigations have identified distinct patterns of low-frequency electrophysiological activity that are characteristic of various behavioral milestones. In this investigation, the authors focused on the cross-sectional developmental properties of high-frequency spectral power from the brain's default mode network (DMN) during goal-directed behavior. METHODS The authors contrasted regionally specific, time-evolving high gamma power (HGP) in the lateral DMN cortex between 3 young children (age range 3-6 years) and 3 adults by use of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings over the left perisylvian cortex during a picture-naming task. RESULTS Across all participants, a nearly identical and consistent response suppression of HGP, which is a functional signature of the DMN, was observed during task performance recordings acquired from ECoG electrodes placed over the lateral DMN cortex. This finding provides evidence of relatively early maturation of the DMN. Furthermore, only HGP relative to evoked alpha and beta band power showed this level of consistency across all participants. CONCLUSIONS Regionally specific, task-evoked suppression of the high-frequency components of the cortical power spectrum is established early in brain development, and this response may reflect the early maturation of specific cognitive and/or computational mechanisms.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

In Experiment 1, we asked participants to perform two tasks that varied in cognitive demands: transcription and exposition about an autobiographical episode. Lacunarity was significantly lower in transcription. In Experiment 2, we compared a veridical and a fictitious version of a personal event. Lacunarity was lower in veridical texts.

Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192871,2017,What Does the DAP:IQ Measure?: Drawing Comparisons between Drawing Performance and Developmental Assessments.,y

This process is characterized by loneliness, the self-imposition of limitations, and the lack of personalized knowledge and communication skills to manage the impact of disease and society's reactions. Our study provides insight into needs of early interventions tailored to address condition, role, and emotional management, involving parent education, peer support, storytelling, and roles for professionals. We argue that further research should involve young people, their parents, and professionals in the development and evaluation of interventions.",United States,Qualitative health research,29192872,2018,Experience of Being Young With Psoriasis: Self-Management Support Needs.,y

Results revealed that the 5- to 8-year-old children were able to discriminate between antisocial and prosocial teases. Although the children's parents or legal guardians indicated that the children had more frequent experience with prosocial than antisocial teases in the home, (a) the children were better able to correctly identify the intent of antisocial teasers than prosocial teasers and (b) the parents or legal guardians (correctly) indicated that their child would be better able to recognize an antisocial tease than a prosocial tease. Despite the finding that the children's comprehension of antisocial teasing tended to exceed their comprehension of prosocial teasing, the findings indicate that being relatively young (i.e., 5-6Â years old vs. 7-8Â years old) and having relatively frequent experience with antisocial teasing in the home may be associated with some children's difficulty in recognizing the intent behind antisocial teases.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192874,2017,Young Children's ability to Discriminate between Antisocial and Prosocial Teases.,y
1740,"OBJECTIVE Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, more patients with a high body mass index (BMI) will require surgical treatment for degenerative spinal disease. In previous investigations of lumbar spine pathology, obesity has been associated with worsened postoperative outcomes and increased costs. However, few studies have examined the association between BMI and postoperative outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes, postoperative narcotics consumption, complications, and hospital costs among BMI stratifications for patients who have undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF procedures. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained surgical database of patients who had undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spinal pathology between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified by BMI as follows: normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), or obese II-III (â‰¥ 35.0 kg/m2). Differences in patient demographics and preoperative characteristics were compared across the BMI cohorts using 1-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Multivariate linear or Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine the presence of an association between BMI category and narcotics utilization, improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores, incidence of complications, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, and hospital costs. Regression analyses were controlled for preoperative demographic and procedural characteristics. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients were included in the analysis, of whom 20.9% (n = 58) were normal weight, 37.5% (n = 104) were overweight, 24.9% (n = 69) were obese I, and 16.6% (n = 46) were obese II-III. A higher BMI was associated with an older age (p = 0.049) and increased comorbidity burden (p = 0.001). No differences in sex, smoking status, insurance type, diagnosis, presence of neuropathy, or preoperative VAS pain scores were found among the BMI cohorts (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found among these cohorts as regards operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and number of operative levels (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in postoperative narcotics consumption, VAS score improvement, complication rates, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, or total direct costs existed across BMI stratifications (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher BMI demonstrated surgical outcomes, narcotics consumption, and hospital costs comparable to those of patients with a lower BMI. Thus, ACDF procedures are both safe and effective for all patients across the entire BMI spectrum. Patients should be counseled to expect similar rates of postoperative complications and eventual clinical improvement regardless of their BMI.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

1741,"In response to varying stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor is able to promote repair, survival, or elimination of damaged cells - processes that have great relevance to organismal aging. Although the link between p53 and cancer is well established, the contribution of p53 to the aging process is less clear. Delineating how p53 regulates distinct aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered metabolic pathways will be critical. Mouse models have further revealed the centrality and complexity of the p53 network in aging processes. While naturally aged mice have linked longevity with declining p53 function, some accelerated aging mice present with chronic p53 activation, whose phenotypes can be rescued upon p53 deficiency. Further, direct modulation of the p53-MDM2 axis has correlated elevated p53 activity with either early aging or with delayed-onset aging. We speculate that p53-mediated aging phenotypes in these mice must have (1) stably active p53 due to MDM2 dysregulation or chronic stress or (2) shifted p53 outcomes. Pinpointing which p53 stressors, modifications, and outcomes drive aging processes will provide further insights into our understanding of the human aging process and could have implications for both cancer and aging therapeutics.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cdd.2017.187.",England,Cell death and differentiation,29192902,2017,Relevance of the p53-MDM2 axis to aging.,y

In recent years, the recovery-oriented approaches (along with experiences and thoughts of patients and patient's relatives) have been taken into account for establishing mental health services and policies. This study aims to identify the factors contributing to recovery, as observed from the perspective of schizophrenia patients working at The Blue Horse CafÃ© which was founded by the Federation of Schizophrenia Associations.


METHOD
The sample for the study consisted of 24 patients who worked at The Blue Horse CafÃ©. A phenomenological approach was used in the study, whereby interviews with patients were analyzed qualitatively.


RESULTS
Certain common factors, which were expressed as having contributed to recovery, were identified from the perspective of schizophrenia patients. These factors are: 1-The fact that the setting is informal and welcoming without being constrictive; 2-Predominance of the human element; 3-Hope and encouragement; 4-Being cared about; 5-Being able to reach someone when in need of support; 6-Friendly sharing; 7-Having a purpose, assuming responsibility, and being motivated; and 8-Giving meaning to life.


CONCLUSION
The findings may serve as a stimulus since schizophrenia patients that contribute to recovery give mental health professionals the opportunity to question there need for a change in their professional roles. Additionally, schizophrenia patients that have experienced The Blue Horse CafÃ© draw attention to certain points and these points can serve as a guide, especially for establishing the working METHODS of Community Mental Health Centers.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192939,2017,[Lessons Learned from Experiencing Mavi At CafÃ© (Blue Horse CafÃ©) during Six Years: A Qualitative Analysis of Factors Contributing to Recovery from the Perspective of Schizophrenia Patients].,y

Impairment in immune functions is proposed as a key factor in the cognitive decline in bipolar disorder (BD) however there is scarcity of research on the impact of inflammation on cognitive functions. Our aim is to compare IL-18 and IL-6 levels in BD patients and controls and to study the relationship between IL-18 and IL-6 levels and cognitive impairment METHOD: Thirty-six euthymic BD-I patients and 38 age, sex and educational level matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants were evaluated with neurocognitive tests. The plasma IL-6 and IL-18 levels of both groups were measured with ELISA kits.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between IL-6 and IL-18 levels of patient and healthy control groups. In the patient group, IL-18 level was positively correlated with completed categories score wheras there was a negative correlation with perseverative response and perseverative errors. Moreover IL-18 level was positively correlated with immediate recall, delayed recall and learning scores while there was a negative correlation with stroop interference scores. No correlation was found between IL-6 level and neuropsychological test scores in the patient group.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study that investigates the relation of IL-18 with cognitive functions. Possible detrimental or protective effects of IL-18 in BD is not yet clear, however the positive association of IL-18 level and neuropsychological test scores might indicate a neuroprotective role of IL-18 in the euthymic period of BD which is the closest state to physiological condition.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192940,2017,[The Relationship of Interleukin-18 and Interleukin-6 Levels with Cognitive Functions in Bipolar Disorder].,y

METHODS
For clarifying this we searched for three polymorphisms (Arg199/His, Ser75/Asn, and Ile49/Val) in carboxylesterase-1 gene (CES-1) in the saliva of patients diagnosed with PDD+ADHD. Also, we assessed the clinical response to MPH by dimensional approach using the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale.

This study aimed to examine the cognitive profiles of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the latter of which was recently standardized in Turkey. In addition, the reading abilities and intelligence scores of these children were also investigated.


METHODS
A total of 48 children with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 16 years who were outpatients in MuÅŸ State Hospital were included in this study. The children were administered the WISC-R, the WISC-IV, and the Oral Reading Skills and Reading Comprehension Test (ORCT).


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the WISC-R IQ scores and WISC-IV index scores. Moreover, reading comprehension skills (derived from ORCT scores) were predicted with significant accuracy by both the WISC-R Verbal IQ and the WISC-IV WMI (Working Memory Index).


CONCLUSION
Results of this study suggest that the WISC-R and the WISC-IV scale are not sufficient for obtaining a specific cognitive profile for ADHD - there is no significant difference between them. However, the four-factor structure of the WISC-IV is believed to provide more specific information. In addition, results of this study related to reading skills indicate that the importance of reading skills should not be overlooked when assessing children with ADHD.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192943,2017,[Comparing Two Editions of Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Assessing Reading Skills in Children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder].,y

We aimed to review the literature related to attention, memory, and executive functions in PTSD. Although studies on the subject are limited (in that there is no uniformity in terms of trauma type, selection of the control groups or types of neuropsychological tests used), most reported similar deficits in PTSD subjects in terms of memory and executive functions including attention. Since the presence of psychiatric comorbidities may disrupt neuropsychological functions, results of studies that have not controlled comorbidity may be questionable. However, studies that excluded the comorbid conditions reported similar deficits in cognitive functions in PTSD patients. The relationship between recovery from PTSD symptoms and change in cognitive functions has been examined in only a few studies, and most have reported an improvement for both memory and executive functions in remitted patients. The improvement in executive functions, however, has been limited by the difficulty of task. Cognitive deficits have been among the major causes of disabilities in PTSD patients.

Dementia-related behavioral symptoms and functional dependence result in poor quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The goal was to determine whether a home-based activity program (Tailored Activity Program; TAP-VA) would reduce behavioral symptoms and functional dependence of veterans with dementia and caregiver burden.


DESIGN
Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).


SETTING
Veteran's homes.


PARTICIPANTS
Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).


INTERVENTION
Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.


MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.


RESULTS
Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control). At 4 months, compared to controls, the TAP-VA group showed reductions in number (difference in mean change from baseline = -0.68, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.13) and frequency by severity (-24.3, 95% CI = -45.6 to -3.1) of behavioral symptoms, number of activities needing assistance with (-0.80, 95% CI = -1.41 to -0.20), functional dependence level (4.09, 95% CI = 1.06, 7.13), and pain (-1.18, 95% CI = -2.10 to -0.26). Caregivers of veterans in TAP-VA reported less behavior-related distress. Benefits did not extend to 8 months.

Smoke-free laws reduce disease prevalence. The impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky was examined. The authors hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of smoke-free laws.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of 83,727 Kentucky residents agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50 years who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 1995 to 2014. In 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free laws. County-level characteristics included adult smoking rate, sex, race/ethnicity, income, physician supply, observed radon values, and rurality.


RESULTS
Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The difference in lung cancer incidence between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws did not confer the same benefit. One hundred percent smoke-free laws, covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions, may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.

For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62 Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs, economic returns and chances of success of investments in different tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect varied substantially by parental social class and level of education. The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates increased their participation in more rewarding university fields. Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects. Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.",England,The British journal of sociology,29193014,2017,Information barriers and social stratification in higher education: evidence from a field experiment.,y

To examine the diagnostic ability of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <36wks postmenstrual age) to detect later adverse motor outcomes or cerebral palsy (CP) in infants born preterm.


METHOD
Studies of infants born preterm with MRI earlier than 36 weeks postmenstrual age and quantitative motor data or a diagnosis of CP at or beyond 1 year corrected age were identified. Study details were extracted and meta-analyses performed where possible. Quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 (a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies).


RESULTS
Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which reported diagnostic accuracy and five reported data sufficient for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. Early structural MRI global scores detected a later diagnosis of CP with a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86-100) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 59-100). Global structural MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 44-100) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 90-100). White matter scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 20-48) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 78-88).


INTERPRETATION
Early structural MRI has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine adverse motor outcomes and CP in infants born preterm. Greater reporting of diagnostic accuracy in studies examining relationships with motor outcomes and CP is required to facilitate clinical utility of early MRI.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine later adverse motor outcomes and cerebral palsy (CP).

To examine the factors contributing to nurses choosing to exit the nursing profession before retirement age.


BACKGROUND
Population growth, ageing and growing demand for health services mean increased demand for nurses. Better retention could help meet this demand, yet little work has been done in New Zealand to understand early attrition.


METHODS
An online survey of registered and enrolled nurses and nurse practitioners who had left nursing was used. This study reports analysis of responses from 285 ex-nurses aged under 55.


FINDINGS
The primary reasons nurses left the profession were as follows: workplace concerns; personal challenges; career factors; family reasons; lack of confidence; leaving for overseas; unwillingness to complete educational requirements; poor work-life balance; and inability to find suitable nursing work. Most nurses discussed their intentions to leave with a family member or manager and most reported gaining transferrable skills through nursing.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses leave for many reasons. Implementing positive practice environments and individualized approaches to retaining staff may help reduce this attrition. Generational changes in the nature of work and careers mean that nurses may continue to leave the profession sooner than anticipated by policymakers.


IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
If the nursing workforce is to be able to meet projected need, education, recruitment and retention policies must urgently address issues leading to early attrition. In particular, policies improving the wider environmental context of nursing practice and ensuring that working environments are safe and nurses are well supported must be developed and implemented. Equally, national nursing workforce planning must take into account that nursing is no longer viewed as a career for life.",England,International nursing review,29193041,2017,Early nurse attrition in New Zealand and associated policy implications.,y

1756,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic sleep deficiency is associated with early mortality. In the epileptic population, there is a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, and individuals with severe refractory epilepsy are at greater risk of premature mortality than the general population. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affects 1:1000 cases of epilepsy each year. Ketogenic diet (KD) treatment is one of the few effective options for refractory seizures. Despite KD reducing seizures and increasing longevity in Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, they still succumb to sudden death. This study aims to determine whether (1) the rest profiles of KO and KD-treated KO (KOKD) mice resemble each other as a function of either age or proximity to death and (2) the timing of death correlates with acute or chronic changes in rest.


METHODS
Noninvasive actimetry was used to monitor rest throughout the lives of KO and wild-type (WT) littermates administered standard diet or KD.


RESULTS
As KO mice age, rest is reduced (PÂ <Â .0001). Rest is significantlyÂ improved in KDKO mice (PÂ <Â .0001), resembling WT values at several ages. When age is removed as a variable and data are realigned to the day of death, the rest profiles of KO and KOKD groups worsen to similar degrees as a function of proximity to death. The amount of rest acutely is not sensitive to the timing of death, whereas chronic rest deficiency profiles (10-15Â days prior to death) of both groups were indistinguishable. Chronic accumulation of rest deficiency over the final 15Â days was associated with 75% of deaths.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our data suggest that the accumulated rest deficiency is associated with sudden death in Kv1.1 KO mice. These data (1) support the proposed clinical hypothesis that chronic sleep deficiency may be associated with early mortality in epileptic patients and (2) warrant future preclinical and clinical studies on sleep monitoring in epileptic patients.",United States,Epilepsia,29193044,2017,"Accumulation of rest deficiency precedes sudden death of epileptic Kv1.1 knockout mice, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",y

1759,"OBJECTIVE
Using a ""double-pulse"" adaptation paradigm, in which two stimuli are presented in quick succession, this study examines the neural mechanisms underlying potentiation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in visual snow syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous ""double-pulse"" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.


METHODS
We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.


RESULTS
In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",United States,Headache,29193050,2017,Antagonistic Relationship Between VEP Potentiation and Gamma Power in Visual Snow Syndrome.,y
1760,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies show migraineurs are at an increased risk of developing suicidal behaviors, even after controlling for comorbid depression. However, previous research has not examined the impact of psychiatric mood disorders on suicidal behaviors in migraineurs within a nationally representative sample.


OBJECTIVE
A cross-sectional study was used to investigate the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors and determine whether psychiatric comorbidities modify this association in a nationwide inpatient cohort.


METHODS
We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations compiled from USA billing data. Migraine, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric disorders were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes from hospitalization discharges (2007-2012). Weighted national estimates were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
156,172,826 hospitalizations were included, of which 1.4% had a migraine diagnosis and 1.6% had a diagnosis of suicidal behavior. Migraineurs had a 2.07-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.96-2.19) compared with non-migraineurs. We repeated analyses after stratifying by depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among hospitalizations with depression, migraine was associated with a 20% reduced odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 0.76-0.85). Among hospitalizations without depression, migraine was associated with 2.35-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 2.20-2.51). In stratified analyses, we noted that among hospitalizations with anxiety, migraineurs had slightly increased odds of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.13). Among hospitalizations without anxiety, migraine was associated with a 2.06-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.94-2.20). Similarly, in analyses stratified by PTSD, migraine was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94-1.07) among those with PTSD. However, the odds of suicidal behaviors were increased among hospitalizations without PTSD (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.84-2.08).


CONCLUSION
Chronic conditions that do not affect the current hospitalization may not have been reported. The presence of psychiatric diagnoses influences associations of suicidal behaviors with migraine in a national inpatient sample. Migraineurs with diagnosed comorbid psychiatric disorders may be receiving care that mitigates their risk for suicidal behaviors.",United States,Headache,29193052,2017,Association Between Migraine and Suicidal Behaviors: A Nationwide Study in the USA.,y
1761,"Variation in the shape of the human face and in stature is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental influences. One such environmental influence is malnourishment, which can result in growth faltering, usually diagnosed by means of comparing an individual's stature with a set of age-appropriate standards. These standards for stature, however, are typically ascertained in groups where people are at low risk for growth faltering. Moreover, genetic differences among populations with respect to stature are well established, further complicating the generalizability of stature-based diagnostic tools. In a large sample of children aged 5-19 years, we obtained high-resolution genomic data, anthropometric measures and 3D facial images from individuals within and around the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. With genome-wide complex trait analysis, we partitioned genetic and environmental variance for growth outcomes and facial shape. We found that children with growth faltering have faces that look like those of older and taller children, in a direction opposite to the expected allometric trajectory, and in ways predicted by the environmental portion of covariance at the community and individual levels. The environmental variance for facial shape varied subtly but significantly among communities, whereas genetic differences were minimal. These results reveal that facial shape preserves information about exposure to undernourishment, with important implications for refining assessments of nutritional status in children and the developmental-genetics of craniofacial variation alike.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193055,2017,Facial shape manifestations of growth faltering in Tanzanian children.,y

Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive change resulting from challenging life events. The current study examined factors associated with PTG in traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.


METHOD
Participants (NÂ =Â 221) in this prospective cohort study included adults admitted to a Level I trauma center. Over half the participants (60%) were male, with a mean age of 47. Participants completed baseline measures during hospitalization. PTG was assessed at 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Greater PTG was associated with minority race/ethnicity, lower income, automotive collision, and premorbid psychological disorder other than depression or posttraumatic stress (PTS). These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients. Analysis confirmed that greater PTS at follow-up was associated with more growth.


CONCLUSION
Participants with the most growth also experienced the most distress.

Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED) and high- (HE), moderate- (ME) and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30 min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with Î±7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical Î±7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

In a pair of studies, we have corroborated that merely expressing attitudes towards the Jewish minority affects people's relevant behaviour towards this group. In an Internet study, participants who first completed verbal attitude measures were more likely to donate to a Jewish organisation compared to those who completed the measures after making the decision to donate. Moreover, responses to attitude measures of various types and donating to the Jewish organisation were correlated when attitudes had been expressed in the first step. When attitudes were measured after the decision to donate, only the responses to the traditional anti-Semitic scale were correlated with this behaviour. In the field study, in which the time interval between attitude and behaviour measures was introduced, no question-behaviour effect was observed.

1766,"Auditory brainstem neurons are functionally primed to fire action potentials (APs) at markedly high-rates in order to rapidly encode acoustic information of sound. This specialization is critical for survival and the comprehension of behaviourally relevant communication functions, including sound localization and understanding speech in noise. Here, we investigated underlying ion channel mechanisms essential for high-rate AP firing in neurons of the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM) - the avian analog of bushy cells of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In addition to the established function of high-voltage activated potassium channels, we found that resurgent sodium current (INaR ) plays a role in regulating rapid firing activity of late-developing (embryonic [E] days 19-21) NM neurons. INaR of late-developing NM neurons showed similar properties with mammalian neurons in that its unique mechanism of an ""open channel block state"" facilitated the recovery and increased the availability of sodium (NaV ) channels after depolarization. Using a computational model of NM neurons, we demonstrated that removal of INaR reduced high-rate AP firing. We found weak INaR during a prehearing period (E11-12), which transformed to resemble late-developing INaR properties around hearing onset (E14-16). Anatomically, we detected strong NaV 1.6 expression near maturation, which became increasingly less distinct at hearing onset and prehearing periods, suggesting that multiple NaV channel subtypes may contribute to INaR during development. We conclude that INaR plays an important role in regulating rapid AP firing for NM neurons, a property that may be evolutionarily conserved for functions related to similar avian and mammalian hearing.

1767,"This study aimed to investigate whether variable patterns of responses can be acquired and maintained by negative reinforcement under an avoidance contingency. Six male Wistar rats were exposed to sessions in which behavioral variability was reinforced according to a Lag contingency: Sequences of three responses on two levers had to differ from one, two or three previous sequences for shocks to be avoided (Lag 1, Lag 2 and Lag 3, respectively). Performance under the Lag conditions was compared with performance on a Yoke condition in which the animals received the same reinforcement frequency and distribution as in the Lag condition but behavioral variability was not required. The results showed that most of the subjects varied their sequences under the Lag contingencies, avoiding shocks with relatively high probability (â‰¥ 0.7). Under the Yoke procedure, responding continued to occur with high probability, but the behavioral variability decreased. These results suggest that behavioral variability can be negatively reinforced.",United States,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,29193141,2017,Behavioral variability as avoidance behavior.,y
1768,"BACKGROUND
Exposure to alcohol content in movies has been shown to be associated with adolescent use of alcohol, including earlier onset. This study examined the influence of movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol onset, considering the social context (whether the movie was viewed with a friend or parent). We examined whether media's influence holds across a spectrum of early drinking milestones: sipping (but not consuming a full drink of) alcohol, consuming a full drink of alcohol, and engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED).


METHODS
Data were taken from a sample of 882 middle school youth (52% female; 24% non-White) enrolled in an ongoing study on alcohol initiation and progression. Exposure to alcohol content in films was measured using a method that combines content analysis and random assignment of movie titles to youth surveys. The hazard of initiating alcohol use (sip, full drink, HED) as a function of exposure was estimated using survival analysis. Associations were adjusted for demographic, personality, and social influence factors known to be associated with both movie exposure and alcohol use.


RESULTS
Exposure to alcohol content was common. Hours of exposure prospectively predicted earlier onset of alcohol involvement across all outcomes. Viewing movies with friends appeared to augment the media exposure effect, in contrast to viewing movies with parents, which was not a significant predictor of initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to alcohol in films is involved in the entry into early stages of alcohol involvement. Findings support further investigation into the role of the media in underage drinking, especially in the context of consuming media with friends and peers. Limiting media exposure and/or stronger Federal Trade Commission oversight of movie ratings should be a priority for preventing underage drinking.",England,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",29193150,2017,Exposure to Alcohol Content in Movies and Initiation of Early Drinking Milestones.,y

1770,"The primary goal of this study was to examine and describe the importance of childbearing as perceived by infertile women in the Chinese familial and social context. We adopted a qualitative descriptive method and conducted semi-structured interviews with female patients diagnosed with infertility. Participants were recruited at a high-volume fertility clinic in Tianjin, China. Fifteen women with a diagnosis of infertility were interviewed for 60-90â€‰min. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Two themes supported the importance of childbearing for Chinese women with infertility: childbearing as natural law, and childbearing for relational harmony. Childbearing as natural law referred to intrinsic forces to seek a child, including (i) achieving motherhood and womanhood and (ii) experiencing a developmental transition with childbearing as a landmark. Relational harmony included three primary factors: (i) to maintain marital quality by preventing marital failure and rejuvenating an unsatisfactory marital relationship; (ii) to fulfill both authoritative and reciprocal filial piety; (iii) to build a sense of normalcy within family and social networks. In summary, infertility resulted in loss of motherhood, womanhood, and a smooth developmental transition. Moreover, it threatened relationship harmony in the marriage, family, and social life. These insights on the value of childbearing in the Chinese context can inform healthcare professionals in identify infertility-related demands and developing relevant psychosocial services for people with infertility.",United States,Research in nursing & health,29193167,2017,Childbearing importance: A qualitative study of women with infertility in China.,y

As the workforce ages, occupational injuries from falls on the same level will increase. Some industries may be more affected than others.

We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate same-level fall injury incidence rates by age group, gender, and industry for four sectors: 1) healthcare and social assistance; 2) manufacturing; 3) retail; and 4) transportation and warehousing. We calculated rate ratios and rate differences by age group and gender.


RESULTS
Same-level fall injury incidence rates increase with age in all four sectors. However, patterns of rate ratios and rate differences vary by age group, gender, and industry. Younger workers, men, and manufacturing workers generally have lower rates.

1772,"Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of emerging infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour changes on epidemics can be key to improving control efforts. However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases. Therefore, in terms of mitigating emerging infectious diseases, both media publicity focused on how to guide people's behaviour change and positive responses of individuals are critical.",England,Statistics in medicine,29193194,2017,Impact of individual behaviour change on the spread of emerging infectious diseases.,y

While it is known that informal caregiving is associated with care-derived self-esteem cross-sectionally, little is known about the impact of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. Thus, we aimed at examining whether informal caregiving affects general self-esteem using a longitudinal approach.


METHODS
Data were gathered from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 40 and over in Germany from 2002 to 2014 (n = 21 271). General self-esteem was quantified using the Rosenberg scale. Individuals were asked whether they provide informal care regularly.


RESULTS
Fixed effects regressions showed no significant effect of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. General self-esteem decreased with increasing morbidity, increasing age, decreasing social ties, whereas it was not associated with changes in employment status, marital status and body mass index. Additional models showed that decreases in self-esteem were associated with decreases in functional health and increases in depressive symptoms.

The older persons lacked knowledge about their condition, which generated poor insight into their medical treatment and this in turn affected their daily life. They had thoughts and questions about their medication, but did not have an opportunity to ask the questions because of lack of follow-up from the healthcare system.

1776,"Animals maintained in captivity exhibit rapid changes in phenotypic traits, which may be maladaptive for natural environments. The phenotype can shift away from the wild phenotype via transgenerational effects, with the environment experienced by parents influencing the phenotype and fitness of offspring. There is emerging evidence that controlling transgenerational effects could help mitigate the effects of captivity, improving the success of captively bred animals post release. However, controlling transgenerational effects requires knowledge of the mechanisms driving transgenerational changes. To better understand the genetic mechanisms that contribute to transgenerational effects in captivity we investigated the heritability of behavioral phenotypes using mid parent- and single parent-offspring regressions in a population of captive-reared house mouse (Mus musculus) that we had previously shown exhibit transgenerational changes in boldness and activity behavioral types. Slopes for boldness and activity were all positive, indicating a low to moderate degree of heritability. Though, none of the heritability estimates were statistically significant due to the large surrounding errors. However, the large error surrounding the heritability estimates may also indicate that there is variability in heritability between behavioral traits within the boldness and activity behavioral types. The implication of this finding is that the potential for heritable genetic changes in captivity varies considerably between traits. We conclude that continued investigation of the potential for traits to evolve in captivity is needed to better inform captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",United States,Zoo biology,29193268,2017,What role does heritability play in transgenerational phenotypic responses to captivity?

1778,"For species at risk of decline or extinction in source-sink systems, sources are an obvious target for habitat protection actions. However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for three endangered species. Using empirically-based habitat-population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of time periods of data collection and prioritized the strongest sources for conservation. We then tested the ability of prioritized patches to identify the most habitats most affecting persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Our results indicated that conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection can impact species persistence. Shorter times series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. As source-sink metrics (i.e., births-deaths; births and immigrations - deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many non-equilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.

1780,"PURPOSE
Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+.


METHODS
Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income.


FINDINGS
In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional.

1781,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a novel feature refinement MR reconstruction method from highly undersampled multichannel acquisitions for improving the image quality and preserve more detail information.


THEORY AND METHODS
The feature refinement technique, which uses a feature descriptor to pick up useful features from residual image discarded by sparsity constrains, is applied to preserve the details of the image in compressed sensing and parallel imaging in MRI (CS-pMRI). The texture descriptor and structure descriptor recognizing different types of features are required for forming the feature descriptor. Feasibility of the feature refinement was validated using three different multicoil reconstruction methods on in vivo data.


RESULTS
Experimental results show that reconstruction methods with feature refinement improve the quality of reconstructed image and restore the image details more accurately than the original methods, which is also verified by the lower values of the root mean square error and high frequency error norm.


CONCLUSION
A simple and effective way to preserve more useful detailed information in CS-pMRI is proposed. This technique can effectively improve the reconstruction quality and has superior performance in terms of detail preservation compared with the original version without feature refinement.

The studies mainly showed that vocal stimuli increased preterm infants' stability in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and behavioural measures. Improvements in feeding skills were also reported. The methods and the measures used in the studies were heterogeneous, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.

1783,"Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures and abnormal electrical activity in the brain, is one of the most prevalent brain disorders. Over two million people in the United States have been diagnosed with epilepsy and 3% of the general population will be diagnosed with it at some point in their lives. While most developmental epilepsies occur due to genetic predisposition, a class of ""acquired"" epilepsies results from a variety of brain insults. A leading etiological factor for epilepsy that is currently on the rise is traumatic brain injury (TBI), which accounts for up to 20% of all symptomatic epilepsies. Remarkably, the presence of an identified early insult that constitutes a risk for development of epilepsy provides a therapeutic window in which the pathological processes associated with brain injury can be manipulated to limit the subsequent development of recurrent seizure activity and epilepsy. Recent studies have revealed diverse pathologies, including enhanced excitability, activated immune signaling, cell death, and enhanced neurogenesis within a week after injury, suggesting a period of heightened adaptive and maladaptive plasticity. An integrated understanding of these processes and their cellular and molecular underpinnings could lead to novel targets to arrest epileptogenesis after trauma. This review attempts to highlight and relate the diverse early changes after trauma and their role in development of epilepsy and suggests potential strategies to limit neurological complications in the injured brain.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193309,2017,Converging early responses to brain injury pave the road to epileptogenesis.,y
1784,"The signaling network involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not yet fully understood. This review aims to describe possible mechanisms through which the bacterial modulators may be linked directly or indirectly to the process of alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. From the late 1970s to present, new paradigm shifts have been developed regarding our understanding of pathological bone remodeling in periodontal disease. Upcoming evidence suggests that in periodontal disease the local immune response is exacerbated and involves the existence of signaling pathways that have been shown to modulate bone-cell function leading to alveolar bone loss. Those complex signaling pathways have been observed not only between bacteria but also between bacteria and the gingival surface of the host. More specifically, it has been shown that bacteria, through their secretion molecules, may interact indirectly and directly with immune-type cells of the host, resulting in the production of osteolytic agents that enhance bone resorption. Further research is required to provide a clear understanding of the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, and the availability of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis, may be useful tools in achieving this.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193310,2017,Bacterial modulators of bone remodeling in the periodontal pocket.,y
1785,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies.

1787,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the longitudinal association of dual and single (vision and hearing) sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults.


METHODS
Two thousand eight hundred ninety adults aged 60Â years or over who participated in the longitudinal population-based TromsÃ¸ Study, Norway, were included. The impact of objective vision loss, self-report hearing loss, or dual sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety, as assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 10, was examined at baseline and 6-year follow-up using linear mixed models.


RESULTS
Hearing loss had a cross-sectional relationship with increased depression (bÂ =Â 0.1750, SEÂ =Â 0.07, PÂ =Â .02) and anxiety symptoms (bÂ =Â 0.1765, SEÂ =Â 0.08, PÂ =Â .03); however, these relationships were not significant at the 6-year follow-up. Both vision loss only and dual sensory loss predicted increased depression scores at follow-up (bÂ =Â 0.0220, SEÂ =Â 0.01, PÂ =Â .03; and bÂ =Â 0.0413, SEÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Adjustment for social isolation did not attenuate the main depression results.


CONCLUSION
Dual sensory loss resulted in increased depression symptomatology over time and posed an additional long-term risk to depression severity beyond having a single sensory loss only. Only hearing loss is associated with anxiety symptoms. Older adults with vision, hearing, and dual sensory loss have different mental health profiles. Therefore, management and intervention should be tailored to the type of sensory loss.",England,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,29193338,2017,"The association amongst visual, hearing, and dual sensory loss with depression and anxiety over 6Â years: The TromsÃ¸ Study.",y
1788,"PURPOSE
Dynamic manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) allows assessment of tissue viability by tracing manganese uptake. We aimed to develop a rapid T1 mapping method for dynamic MEMRI to facilitate assessments of murine kidney viability.


METHODS
A multi-slice saturation recovery fast spin echo (MSRFSE) was developed, validated, and subsequently applied in dynamic MEMRI at 16.4T on ischemic mouse kidneys after 4 weeks of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Baseline T1 values and post-contrast R1 (1/T1 ) changes were measured in cortex (CO), outer (OSOM), inner (ISOM) strips of outer medulla, and inner medulla (IM).


RESULTS
Validation studies showed strong agreement between MSRFSE and an established saturation recovery Look-Locker method. Baseline T1 (s) increased in the stenotic kidney CO (2.10 [1.95-2.56] vs. 1.88 [1.81-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0317) and OSOM (2.17 [2.05-2.33] vs. 1.96 [1.87-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0075) but remained unchanged in ISOM and IM. This method allowed a temporal resolution of 1.43â€‰min in dynamic MEMRI. Mn2+ uptake and retention decreased in stenotic kidneys, particularly in the OSOM (Î”R1 : 0.48 [0.38-0.56] vs. 0.64 [0.61-0.69] s-1 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).


CONCLUSION
Dynamic MEMRI by MSRFSE detected decreased cellular viability and discerned the regional responses to RAS. This technique may provide a valuable tool for noninvasive evaluation of renal viability.

1789,"PURPOSE
In typical MRI protocols, time is spent acquiring a field map to calculate the shim settings for best image quality. We propose a fast template-based field map prediction method that yields near-optimal shims without measuring the field.


METHODS
The template-based prediction method uses prior knowledge of the B0 distribution in the human brain, based on a large database of field maps acquired from different subjects, together with subject-specific structural information from a quick localizer scan. The shimming performance of using the template-based prediction is evaluated in comparison to a range of potential fast shimming methods.


RESULTS
Static B0 shimming based on predicted field maps performed almost as well as shimming based on individually measured field maps. In experimental evaluations at 7â€‰T, the proposed approach yielded a residual field standard deviation in the brain of on average 59â€‰Hz, compared with 50â€‰Hz using measured field maps and 176â€‰Hz using no subject-specific shim.


CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that shimming based on predicted field maps is feasible. The field map prediction accuracy could potentially be further improved by generating the template from a subset of subjects, based on parameters such as head rotation and body mass index.

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.


OBJECTIVES
Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.


METHODS
Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: ""tremor"", ""tremor disorders"", ""essential tremor"", ""dystonic tremor"", and ""classification"" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.


RESULTS
Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2.

Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes.


METHODS
Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite scores.


RESULTS
Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.03 units/year, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003); this difference was comparable with 8â€‰years of aging. However, being in the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal (pâ€‰=â€‰0.71) or global score (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory decline (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.01 units/year, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.002; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive function-attention decline.


CONCLUSIONS
A variable pattern of depressive symptom severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern related to decline in executive function-attention. Findings could signal differences in underlying neuropathologic processes among persons with differing depression patterns and late-life cognitive decline.

1792,"CONTEXT
Medical educators often have prior and primary experience in other academic and clinical disciplines. Individuals seeking successful careers in the education of medical students and doctors must, at some point in their development, make a conscious transition into a new identity as a medical educator. This is a necessary move if individuals are to commit to acquiring and maintaining specialist expertise in medical education. Some achieve this transition successfully, whereas others struggle and may even lose interest and abandon the endeavour. We explored senior educators' experiences of achieving the transition into medical education and their views on what helps and what hinders the process.


METHODS
In 2015 we conducted three focus groups with 15 senior medical educators. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied transition theory to guide our deductive analysis, using Schlossberg's Four S (4S) framework to code and report participants' self-reported perceptions of those factors relating to Self, Situation, Support and Strategy that had assisted them to make a successful transition to a fully acknowledged medical educator identity. Through inductive analysis, we then identified 17 explanatory sub-themes common to all three focus groups.


RESULTS
Background and circumstances, individual motivation, a sense of control, organisational support, and effective networking and information-seeking behaviour were factors identified as contributing to successful transition into, and maintenance of, a strong self-identity as a medical educator.


CONCLUSIONS
The experiences of established medical educators and, in particular, an exploration of the factors that have facilitated their transition to an acknowledged self-identity as a medical educator could assist in supporting new educators to cope with the changes involved in developing as a medical educator.",England,Medical education,29193365,2017,Making the leap to medical education: a qualitative study of medical educators' experiences.,y

To describe what and why nurses self-disclose to patients in mental health care.


BACKGROUND
Self-disclosure is common, but controversial and difficult to delineate. Extant research suggests that self-disclosure might have several potentially beneficial effects on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome for patients in mental health care, but results are often mixed and limited by definitional inconsistencies.


METHOD
Qualitative descriptive study including data from 16 nurses taking part in participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews.


RESULTS
Separate analyses resulted in four themes addressing the research question of what nurses self-disclose, and one main theme and four subthemes addressing why nurses self-disclose. The content of self-disclosure was captured in the four themes: Immediate family, Interests and activities, Life experiences, and Identity. In addition, results showed that disclosures were common among the nurses. Self-disclosure's potential to transform the nurse-patient relationship, making it more open, honest, close, reciprocal and equal, was the overarching reason why nurses shared personal information. The nurses also chose to self-disclose to share existential and everyday sentiments, to give real-life advice, because it felt natural and responsive to patients' question to do so.


CONCLUSION
Nurse self-disclosure is common and covers a variety of personal information. Nurses have several reasons for choosing to self-disclose, most of which are connected to improving the nurse-patient relationship.

To evaluate the effects of the implementation of a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings.


BACKGROUND
Care in long-term residential settings for older people is moving away from the biomedical approach and adopting a more person-centred one. Narrative can help shape the way care is planned and organised. The provision of person-centred care that is holistic and that takes account of resident's beliefs and values can be enhanced by incorporating narrative approaches to care within a practice development framework.


DESIGN
The chosen methodology was participatory action research.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2014, a methodological framework of narrative practice was implemented in two residential care settings, comprising 37 residents and 38 staff, using an action research approach. Three action cycles: (i) narrative practice and culture identification, (ii) developing narrative practice and (iii) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation.


RESULTS
Key outcomes emerged in relation to the findings. These were based on narrative being, knowing and doing and centred around the key outcomes of: (i) how people responded to change (narrative being), (ii) the development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and (iii) intentional action (narrative doing).


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a framework of narrative practice demonstrated that how people respond to change, the development of shared understandings and intentional action were interrelated and interlinked. It illustrated the importance of ensuring that practice context is taken account of in the implementation of action research and the importance of ensuring that narrative being, knowing and doing are clear and understandable for change to occur.

The two smaller groups represented different types of poly-victimization-a non-parental and a long-term parental victimization group.

In England and Wales, 'approved premises' offer 24-hour staffed accommodation for high-risk offenders, most of whom are returning to the community from prison. With a move towards a standardised operating model, it is essential to be able to measure outcomes.


AIMS
Our aim is to collate and evaluate 'benchmarks' for approved premises.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to establish the impact of existing practice in all four approved premises in Wales. Data on well-being, life satisfaction, attitudes to violence and problem-solving abilities were recorded with 114 male residents (of 486), and attitudes to personality disorder and personal well-being/burnout with 30 staff (of 86), in both narrative style and according to a number of scales used within criminal justice and healthcare systems. Perceptions of environmental climate were assessed with both groups. Scores were compared with those from reference groups, including prisoners and secure hospital patients. Criminological outcomes (e.g. prison recall) were obtained for all 486 men.


RESULTS
Scores on the scales used were broadly comparable with those in relevant reference groups, but some showed floor or ceiling effects. Recall rates, whether directly from the premises or after further onward movement, were about 42% overall, comparable with those reported for similar offenders elsewhere.

1798,"The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.",England,Journal of sleep research,29193443,2017,A review of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with anxiety.,y
1799,"A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16Â years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents. Key Practitioner Message The adoption status (but not attachment representations) was found to be predictive of externalizing and total behaviour problems, suggesting that attachment itself is not the only variable to take into account in explaining possible maladaptive outcomes in late-adopted adolescents. Nevertheless, disorganized attachment positively predicted internalizing problems, being a risk factor for both adopted and nonadopted adolescents. Only for late-adopted adolescents, higher cognitive reappraisal was negatively related with externalizing problems, suggesting that the functional and positive ability to cognitively restructure negative situations may help them to reduce impulsive negative reactions towards others. Both increasing cognitive reappraisal and decreasing expressive suppression may be considered as valuable goals of therapy with adopted adolescents and their parents. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadopted peers, reported lower somatic complaints, suggesting that they may not allow themselves to show physical vulnerability as consequence of their early affective experiences of severe deprivation. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadoptedÂ ones, reported higher level of expressive suppression strategies, which may be considered as an attempt to beÂ compliant with the environment's requests in order to be loved, accepted, and nurtured.",England,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,29193445,2017,Late-adoptions in adolescence: Can attachment and emotion regulation influence behaviour problems?

The sample comprised 3770 consecutive patients with a mean age of 49.1Â years; 69.7% were male. OSA was diagnosed and categorized based on a standard respiratory polygraphic sleep study using a type 3 portable monitor. Patients completed the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) prior to the sleep study. In addition, they answered questions about whether they were currently in treatment for mental disorders and whether they had been diagnosed previously with depression.

1801,"BACKGROUND
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence following gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recently, more and more attentions are being focused on gut microbiota in brain and behavior. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is considered as a mediator that links the gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Clostridium butyricum (Cb) on brain damage in a mouse model of TBI.


METHODS
Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a model of TBI-induced by weight-drop impact head injury and were treated intragastrically with Cb.Â The cognitive deficits, brain water content, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) in the brain were also measured.Â Moreover, the intestinal barrier permeability, the expression of TJ protein and GLP-1, and IL-6 level in the intestine were detected.


RESULTS
Cb treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, brain edema, neurodegeneration, and BBB impairment. Meanwhile, Cb treatment also significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins (occludin and zonula occluden-1), p-Akt and Bcl-2, but decreased expression of Bax. Moreover, Cb treatment exhibited more prominent effects on decreasing the levels of plasma d-lactate and colonic IL-6, upregulating expression of Occludin, and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, Cb-treatedÂ mice showed increased the secretion of intestinal GLP-1 and upregulated expression of cerebral GLP-1R.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Cb in TBI mice and the involved mechanisms were partially attributed to the elevating GLP-1 secretion through the gut-brain axis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193450,2017,Clostridium butyricum exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury via the gut-brain axis.,y
1802,"In the retina, MÃ¼ller glia have the potential to become progenitor cells with the ability to proliferate and regenerate neurons. However, the ability of MÃ¼ller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) to proliferate and produce neurons is limited in higher vertebrates. Using the chick model system, we investigate how retinoic acid (RA)-signaling influences the proliferation and the formation of MGPCs. We observed an upregulation of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) in the MÃ¼ller glia of damaged retinas where the formation of MGPCs is known to occur. Activation of RA-signaling was stimulated, whereas inhibition suppressed the proliferation of MGPCs in damaged retinas and in fibroblast growth factor 2-treated undamaged retinas. Furthermore, inhibition of RA-degradation stimulated the proliferation of MGPCs. Levels of Pax6, Klf4, and cFos were upregulated in MGPCs by RA agonists and downregulated in MGPCs by RA antagonists. Activation of RA-signaling following MGPC proliferation increased the percentage of progeny that differentiated as neurons. Similarly, the combination of RA and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) significantly increased neurogenesis from retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ).

The study included One hundred ninety four PD patients in five countries. Investigators completed the following scales: PDCS, MDS-UPDRS, PDSS-2, MoCA, WOK-19, SEND-PD and CISI-PD. For test-retest analysis, a second administration of the PDCS was carried out in 61 stable patients (as per the CISI-PD) in 7 to 14 days after the first evaluation. The PDCS is a novel scale for PD with a total of 17 items divided in 4 domains: motor, non-motor, treatment complication and disability.


RESULTS
PDCS mean and median values were close. Skewness values were into the criterion limits (-1 to +1). The complete range of scores was covered for 14 of the 17 items (83.4%). Floor effect of 25.26% and 28.25% were observed in the Complication and Disability level dimensions due to the proportion of patients free of these difficulties. No relevant floor or ceiling effect was observed for the PDCS Total Score (1.03% and 0.52%, respectively). The stability of the scale appeared excellent with most items meeting weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.80. The convergent validity of the PDCS with corresponding scores of the MDS-UPDRS showed high correlation values (rS â‰¥0.60). The internal validity was into acceptable limits, with the majority of values higher than the minimal 0.30 threshold. The standard error of measurement suggested a satisfactory precision (SEM=3.81, <30% of the PDCS total score standard deviation).


CONCLUSION
The PDCS appears to be a feasible, acceptable, reproducible and valid scale. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",England,European journal of neurology,29193455,2017,The Parkinson's Disease Composite Scale: Results of the first validation study.,y
1804,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. The phenotypic expression of the disease may, in part, relate to alterations in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. This resting-state study sought to clarify this in DLB, how networks differed from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether they were related to clinical symptoms in DLB. Resting-state networks were estimated using independent component analysis. We investigated functional connectivity changes in 31 DLB patients compared to 31 healthy controls and a disease comparator group of 29 AD patients using dual regression and FSLNets. Within-network connectivity was generally decreased in DLB compared to controls, mainly in motor, temporal, and frontal networks. Between-network connectivity was mainly intact; only the connection between a frontal and a temporal network showed increased connectivity in DLB. Differences between AD and DLB were subtle and we did not find any significant correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms in DLB. This study emphasizes the importance of reduced connectivity within motor, frontal, and temporal networks in DLB with relative sparing of the default mode network. The lack of significant correlations between connectivity measures and clinical scores indicates that the observed reduced connectivity within these networks might be related to the presence, but not to the severity of motor and cognitive impairment in DLB patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that AD and DLB may show more similarities than differences in patients with mild disease.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193464,2017,Functional connectivity in dementia with Lewy bodies: A within- and between-network analysis.,y
1805,"How does social information affect the perception of taste early in life? Does mere knowledge of other people's food preferences impact children's own experience when eating? In Experiment 1, 5- and 6-year-old children consumed more of a food described as popular with other children than a food that was described as unpopular with other children, even though the two foods were identical. In Experiment 2, children ate more of a food described as popular with children than a food described as popular with adults. Experiment 3 tested whether different perceptual experiences of otherwise identical foods contributed to the mechanisms underlying children's consumption. After sampling both endpoints of a sweet-to-sour range (applesauce with 0 mL or 5mL of lemon juice added), children were asked to taste and categorize applesauce samples with varying amounts of lemon juice added. When classifying ambiguous samples that were near the midpoint of the range (2 mL and 3 mL), children were more likely to categorize popular foods as sweet as compared to unpopular foods. Together, these findings provide evidence that social information plays a powerful role in guiding children's consumption and perception of foods.

To investigate the feasibility of a 13-week mentoring program in providing social support to promote hope for recovery in anorexia nervosa.


BACKGROUND
With no clear first line psychological treatment for people with anorexia nervosa, mentoring support programs, as an adjunct to treatment, may provide the social support necessary to promote hope for recovery.


DESIGN
A mixed method study; Participatory action research.


METHODS
Women (n=11), recovering and who had recovered from anorexia nervosa, participated in the program and completed self-report questionnaires related to quality of life, distress and the mentoring relationship at different time points. Qualitative feedback from logbooks, workshop evaluation questionnaires, interviews and focus groups was also collected to assess the program's acceptability.


RESULTS
General compliance for completing most study outcome questionnaires was 90% however the mentoring relationship questionnaires were not completed to the same degree. Five key themes emerged from the focus group/interview data: 1) She understands me and could relate to me; 2) Re-connecting with the world - Asking questions and being challenged; 3) Mentors' altruistic motivations and the transformation and discovery of self; 4) Instilling hope - Recovery is possible; and 5) Effective communication - The key to successful mentoring.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is needed however the results provide preliminary support for the mentoring program's feasibility as an adjunct to treatment. We found that having someone who understands, to talk and share with, met a clear need for people with anorexia nervosa.

1807,"Stroke patients with motor deficits typically feature enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, also healthy subjects may show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with higher motor demands. Therefore, the question arises to what extent stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural reorganization. We here investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1) but unlike in healthy controls also in contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of right SPL onto affected/left M1 in patients but not in controls when moving the affected/right hand independent of the movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of right SPL was positively coupled with the ""active"" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency. In summary, these findings are compatible with a supportive role of right SPL with respect to motor function of the paretic hand in the reorganized brain.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193484,2017,Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients.,y

In the era of neurological subspecialization, most neurologists will have a field of specialist interest. The aim of this cross-sectional multi-national study was to identify the key areas of interest among trainees or junior specialists, assess the potential influence of an interest in research, and consider the results in light of population needs.


METHODS
A total of 300 residents and junior neurologists who received a bursary to attend the European Academy of Neurology conference were invited to participate in this study. Demographic and work-related characteristics, as well as main subspecialty of choice were examined via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Participants holding a higher degree (PhD/MD) or working in research posts were considered research oriented.


RESULTS
In total, 191 Neurologists in training or junior specialists responded (response rate 63.7%). Full data were available for 187 participants (59.4% females). The study sample had a mean age of 30.5Â±3.4 years (range 25 - 45). The most popular subspecialty was movement disorders (18.2%), followed by multiple sclerosis (11.2%) and epilepsy (10.2%). This did not differ significantly between the participants who were or were not research-oriented.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a potential mismatch between the interests of trainees, and the future needs of the populations they serve, which it is important to identify for workforce planning.

1810,"OBJECTIVES
No studies have focused on socioeconomic disparities in obesity within and between cohorts. Our objectives were to examine income gradients in obesity between birth-cohorts (inter-cohort variations) and within each birth-cohort (intra-cohort variations) by gender and race/ethnicity.


METHODS
Our sample includes 56,820 white and black adults from pooled, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1971-2012). We fit a series of logistic hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models to control for the effects of age and period, simultaneously. Predicted probabilities of obesity by poverty-to-income ratio were estimated and graphed for 5-year cohort groups from 1901-1990. We also stratified this relationship for four gender and racial/ethnic subgroups.


RESULTS
Obesity disparities due to income were weaker for post-World War I and II generations, specifically the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s to 1950s cohorts, than for other cohorts. In contrast, we found greater income gradients in obesity among cohorts from the 1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to 1970s. Moreover, obesity disparities due to income across cohorts vary markedly by gender and race/ethnicity. White women with higher income consistently exhibited a lower likelihood of obesity than those with lower income since early 1900s cohorts; whereas, black men with higher income exhibited higher risks of obesity than those with lower income in most cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that strategies that address race and/or gender inequalities in obesity should be cognizant of significant historical factors that may be unique to cohorts. Period-based approaches that ignore life-course experiences captured in significant cohort-based experiences may limit the utility of policies and interventions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193504,2017,Cohort-based income gradients in obesity among U.S. adults.,y

This study proposed and tested a structural model to explain and predict family empowerment in families of children with special needs.


BACKGROUND
Family empowerment of families of children with special needs can be explained using the Double ABCX model. Although constant stressors such as parenting stress and family demands can have negative effects on family empowerment, family resources and parenting efficacy can mediate the negative effect through effective coping strategies.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional research design was employed.


METHODS
A survey was conducted with 240 parents of children with special needs. Upon exclusion of 4 responses deemed inadequate to the statistics process, 236 responses were selected for the analysis. Based on the items used in the previous research, we used the scale of family demands 38, the scale of parenting stress 24, the scale of parenting efficacy 37, the scale of pattern of organization 30, the scale of communication process 16, and the scale of family empowerment 32.


RESULTS
In families of children with special needs, parenting stress had a negative effect on parenting efficacy and family resources, namely, pattern of organization and communication process. Family needs had a positive effect on parenting efficacy. Parenting stress and family demands influenced family empowerment through parenting efficacy and family resources (pattern of organization and communication process), while parenting efficacy contributed to family empowerment.


CONCLUSIONS
This study empirically analyzed the usefulness of the Double ABCX model in predicting family empowerment. Family resource factors (organization pattern and communication process) and perception or judgement factors (such as parenting efficacy) were found to mediate the negative impact of various stressors experienced by families of children with special needs.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study findings suggest that clinical practice and management should focus on providing efficient intervention methods to lower stress in families of children with special needs. Reinforcing factors contributing to family empowerment, such as parenting efficacy, organization pattern, and communication process will alleviate families' stress, resulting in a positive educational and developmental impact on children with special needs.

1812,"Neurogenesis encompasses an entire set of events that leads to the generation of newborn neurons from neural stem cells and more committed progenitor cells, including cell division, the production of migratory precursors and their progeny, differentiation and integration into circuits. In particular, the precise control of neuronal migration and morphological changes is essential for the development of the neocortex. Postmitotic cells within the intermediate zone have been found to transiently assume a characteristic ""multipolar"" morphology, after which a multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs before the cells enter the cortical plate; however, the importance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical cytoarchitecture and the precise genetic control of this phase remains largely unknown. Thus, this review article focuses on the multipolar phase in the developing neocortex. It begins by summarizing the molecular mechanism that underlies multipolar migration for the regulation of each step in multipolar phase in intermediate zone. The physiological significance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical lamination and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with migration defects is then described.",England,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,29193520,2017,Physiological significance of multipolar cells generated from neural stem cells and progenitors for the establishment of neocortical cytoarchitecture.,y

To analyze whether living conditions, experienced by mothers and adult daughters during their childhood, are associated with age at menarche (AAM) in daughters.


METHODS
From September, 2011, to January, 2014, AAM and childhood living conditions were collected from a sample of 246 dyads of Maya mothers (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰59.60 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.64) and their adult daughters (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰33.03 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰5.57) from the cities of Merida and Motul in Yucatan, Mexico. Indicators of childhood living conditions were number of siblings and quality of house construction materials in both generations, and father's absence among daughters in their pre-menarcheal years. Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between childhood conditions in mother-daughter dyads and daughter's AAM.


RESULTS
The recalled mean AAM of adult Maya daughters was 12.05 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.53). After adjusting for the influence of mothers' AAM, number of siblings in both the mothers' and daughters' families directly predicted daughters' AAM (more siblings was associated with a later AAM); and a higher (better) index of household conditions in mothers' childhood was associated with earlier AAM in daughters. The household conditions index during the childhood of daughters and father's absence were not associated with their AAM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that better living conditions experienced by the mothers and daughters during their childhood may lower mean AAM in daughters in the context of populations that show important intergenerational changes in their social and economic conditions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193533,2017,"Living conditions and change in age of menarche in adult Maya mothers and daughters from Yucatan, Mexico.",y
1814,"Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, 'boom-and-bust' demography, hybridization, and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure, and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation, and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C. santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C. santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker, and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses' perspectives of language barriers and their impact on the provision of care to patients with limited English proficiency from diverse linguistic background.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Using individual interviews and focus group discussions, data were collected from 59 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals in England. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.


FINDINGS
Three themes: 'multi-ethnicities and language barriers'; 'the impact of language barriers'; and 'communicating via interpreters', were identified. Communication was identified as the most important aspect of care provision and an essential component of a nurse's professional role regardless of the clinical area or speciality. Language barriers were identified as the biggest obstacles in providing adequate, appropriate, effective and timely care to patients with limited English proficiency. Use of professional interpreters was considered useful; however, the limitations associated with use of interpretation service, including arrangement difficulties, availability and accessibility of interpreters, convenience, confidentiality and privacy related issues and impact on the patient's comfort were mentioned.


CONCLUSION
Language barriers, in any country or setting, can negatively affect nurses' ability to communicate effectively with their patients and thereby have a negative impact on the provision of appropriate, timely, safe and effective care to meet patient's needs.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
An understanding of language barriers can help nurses find appropriate strategies to overcome such barriers and, consequently, enhance the provision of effective care to patients affected by language barriers in any clinical setting in any health care system. The findings of the study has international relevance as language barriers affect health care provision in any country or setting. This article is protected by copyright.

Mentorship of junior faculty is an integral component of career development. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) Young Investigator (YI) Committee designed a mentorship program in 2004 whose purpose was to pair YIs (faculty â‰¤10 years of first academic appointment) with a senior mentor to assist with career development and involvement in COG research activities. This study reports on the committee's ability to achieve these goals.


PROCEDURE
An online survey was sent to YIs who were registered with the program from 2004 to2015, assessing three major domains: (1) overall experience with the mentor pairing, (2) satisfaction with the program, and (3) academic accomplishments of the mentees.


RESULTS
The response rate was 64% (110/171). Overall, YIs rated the success of their mentorship pairing as 7.2 out of 10 (median) (25th, 75th quartile 3.6, 9.6). The direct effects of the mentorship program included 70% YIs reporting a positive effect on their career, 40% reporting any grant or manuscript resulting from the pairing, 47% forming a new research collaboration, and 43% receiving appointment to a COG committee. Respondents reported success in COG with 38% authoring a manuscript on behalf of COG and 65% reporting a leadership position including seven current or past COG discipline chairs and 20 study chairs.

A method of real-time, accurate probe tracking at the entrance of the MRI bore is developed, which, fused with pre-procedural MR images, will enable clinicians to perform cryoablation efficiently in a large workspace with image guidance.


METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) tracking coupled with optical tracking is used to track the probe. EM tracking is achieved with an MRI-safe EM sensor working under the scanner's magnetic field to compensate the line-of-sight issue of optical tracking. Unscented Kalman filter-based probe tracking is developed to smooth the EM sensor measurements when occlusion occurs and to improve the tracking accuracy by fusing the measurements of two sensors.


RESULTS
Experiments with a spine phantom show that the mean targeting errors using the EM sensor alone and using the proposed method are 2.21Â mm and 1.80Â mm, respectively.

To describe sleep patterns in young children with epilepsy and to examine levels of agreement between measurements derived from actigraphy and diary recordings.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHODS
Eighty-nine toddlers and preschool-aged children with epilepsy wore an actigraph on their wrists for 7 consecutive days. Parents and caregivers maintained a concurrent sleep diary while the child was wearing the monitor. Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends.


FINDINGS
Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were Â±35, Â±15, Â±82, Â±70, and Â±29 min, respectively. Differences between actigraphy and diary-derived sleep variables were consistently greater for weekends than for weekdays. Discrepancies between actigraphy and diary-derived actual sleep at night were significantly greater for children who slept alone than for those who co-slept with a parent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates an acceptable agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings for sleep onset, sleep offset, and daytime sleep, but insufficient agreement for actual sleep at night and wake after sleep onset, with parents of children sleeping alone more likely to misestimate child sleep behaviors. Deviation of weekend sleep from weekdays further decreased the accuracy of parental sleep estimates and increased the discrepancies between actigraphy and diary.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on brain magnetic resonance imaging, represent an abnormality related to the development of geriatric syndromes. Recently, it has been found that low sympathetic nervous activity might be associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the severity of cerebral WMH and sympathetic nervous activity, measured by the heart rate variability.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 39 older patients. Holter recording was carried out for 30 min. From the RR intervals on the electrocardiogram, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals, the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in all the five segments of the entire recording, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF were calculated. In regard to the WMH, periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The WMH were also rated semiquantitatively according to the methods developed by Junque (periventricular hyperintensities) and de Groot (DWMH).


RESULTS
The LF/HF showed significant negative correlations with the total and regional periventricular hyperintensities, as well as DWMH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the negative associations remained significant between the LF/HF and DWMH (total, temporal, occipital). Furthermore, fall risk index significantly correlated with the LF/HF, total and the occipital DWMH.


CONCLUSIONS
The severity of the DWMH was associated with the LF/HF and the fall risk, one of the important geriatric syndromes, suggesting that WMH, sympathetic nervous dysfunction and geriatric syndrome are interrelated to each other.

Displacement is traumatic and often an unwanted social change that can lead to a loss of identity and socioeconomic, physical, and psychological livelihood. The purpose of the study was to describe the association of perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness to depressive symptom severity in Palestinian refugees, taking into consideration gender and poverty.


DESIGN
The descriptive, correlational study was framed within a socioecological lens. Data collection occurred between October 2015 and November 2015 in Amman, Jordan, which hosts the most Palestinian refugees in the world. The participants in the sample (N = 177) had a mean age of 36.9 years.


METHODS
Participants responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptom severity, the RAND-36 perceived health item, and a statement about hopefulness to return to Palestine. Descriptive, correlation, and logistic and linear regression analyses were computed.


FINDINGS
Results showed that 43% of participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 42% lived in poverty, and 20% had fair or poor health; yet, 60% were hopeful about returning to Palestine. Participants who had better perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness were less likely to have symptoms of major depression. Perceived health was the only factor-not gender, poverty, or right-of-return hopefulness-that explained the variance in depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Palestinian adult refugees in Jordan exhibited symptoms of major depression that were associated with poorer perceived health and less hopefulness about repatriation to Palestine.

An increase in medical hegemony, the ascendancy of allied health in mental health service provision, the need for uncritical and servile workers, protocol-driven work practices, and a failure of leadership to mobilize any substantial resistance to these trends have enabled the infection to spread. The recognition of zombification, active resistance against the forces that conspire to cause it, and the cultivation of genuine conscientious critical thought and debate offer the only hope of survival of mental health nursing as a thriving specialty.",Australia,International journal of mental health nursing,29193640,2017,"Rise of the zombie institution, the failure of mental health nursing leadership, and mental health nursing as a zombie category.",y

Many older adults face limitations to participating in active leisure activities as a result of their physical constraints from aging. Passive leisure activities become alternative leisure activities for older adults as a result of limited physical capacity. The present study sought to determine whether there exists a difference in the frequency of participation in passive and active leisure activities, and the effect of participation in passive and active leisure activities on the life satisfaction level of old adults.


METHODS
A total of 460 participants aged 60-95â€‰years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index - Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities.


RESULTS
The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), homemaking/maintenance (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and traveling (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index - Z for older adults.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates. The current study suggests marketing and programming plans to overcome the constraints that influence older adults' life satisfaction.

Little is known about the role of PRS in densely affected multigenerational families. We tested PRS differences between affected SZ and BD family members from their non-affected adult relatives (NAARs) in Eastern Quebec Kindreds and from controls. We examined 1227 subjects: from 17 SZ and BD kindreds, we studied 153 patients (57 SZ, 13 schizoaffective, and 83 BD) and 180 NAARs, and 894 unrelated controls from the Eastern Quebec population. PRS were derived from published case-control association studies of SZ and BD. We also constructed a combined SZ and BD PRS by using SNPs from both SZ and BD PRS. SZ patients had higher SZ PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0039, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027) and BD patients had higher BD PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027).

Dietary cholesterol has been shown to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed that oxysterol especially 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) may play a potential role in Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) production and accumulation during AD progression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To investigate the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol and 27-OHC on learning and memory impairment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with cholesterol diet with or without 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole) injection. We determined the levels of cholesterol, 27-OHC, 24S-OHC, 7Î±-OHC and 7Î²-OHC in plasma; ApoA, ApoB, HDL-C and LDL-C in plasma or brain; CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in liver and CYP46A1 and CYP7B1 in brain; cathepsin B, cathepsin D and acid phosphatase in lysosome; AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 in brain. Results showed increased levels of 27-OHC (PÂ <Â 0.01), LDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.01), ApoB (PÂ <Â 0.01) and decreased level of HDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.05) in plasma, upregulated CYP27A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) and CYP7A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) expression in liver, altered lysosomal function and increased level of AÎ² in brain (PÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
This study indicated that the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol on learning and memory impairment may be involved in cholesterol metabolism and lysosome function with the increase of plasma 27-OHC, thus resulting in AÎ² formation and accumulation.

1828,"Recent studies showed cultural worldviews are a key determinant of environmental risk perceptions; thus, they could influence climate change adaptation strategies. African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45 % of agro-pastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a compliment to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation.

Strengthening neighborhood social networks is important for promoting health among older adults. However, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing older adults' social networks have not yet been established. The present study examined whether a university-led community intervention that provided communication opportunities could increase older Japanese adults' neighborhood social networks.


METHODS
The present study used a quasi-experimental design. Before the intervention, using postal mail, we carried out a baseline questionnaire survey that was sent to all people living in the Tsurukabuto community aged â‰¥60â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰1769), of whom 1068 responded. For the community intervention, 18 event-based programs were provided over the course of 1â€‰year at Kobe University. Academic staff at Kobe University organized all the programs. During the program, social interactions among participants were promoted. A follow-up survey was distributed to those who responded to the baseline survey, and 710 individuals answered the question about their participation in the intervention programs (138 respondents were participants, 572 were non-participants). The neighborhood social network was measured in both the baseline and follow-up surveys.


RESULTS
Analysis of covariance showed that the changes in neighborhood social network among participants in the program was significantly higher than the changes among non-participants (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046) after adjusting for the baseline score of social network.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study found that participants of the intervention expanded their neighborhood social network, but non-participants did not.

1830,"Neural crest cells (NCC) can migrate into different parts of the body and express their strong inductive potential. In addition, they are multipotent and are able to differentiate into various cell types with diverse functions. In the primitive gut, NCC induce differentiation of muscular structures and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and they themselves differentiate into the elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), neurons and glial cells. ICC develop by way of mesenchymal cell differentiation in the outer parts of the primitive gut wall around the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia, with the exception of colon, where they appear simultaneously also at the submucosal border of the circular muscular layer around the submucosal plexus (SMP) ganglia. However, in a complex process of reciprocal induction of NCC and local mesenchyma, c-kit positive precursors are the first to differentiate, representing probably the common precursors of ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). C-kit positive precursors could represent a key impact factor regarding the final differentiation of NCC into neurons and glial cells with neurons subsequently excreting stem cell factor (SCF) and other signalling molecules. Under the impact of SCF, a portion of c-kit positive precursors lying immediately around the ganglia differentiate into ICC, while the rest differentiate into SMC.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193736,2017,Development of interstitial cells of Cajal in the human digestive tract as the result of reciprocal induction of mesenchymal and neural crest cells.,y
1831,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A.

1832,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multi-arm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of LGMs, how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model in order to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network. A publicly available R package, nmaINLA, is developed to automate the INLA implementation of NMA models which are considered in this paper. Three applications illustrate the use of INLA for a NMA.",England,Research synthesis methods,29193801,2017,A design-by-treatment interaction model for network meta-analysis and meta-regression with integrated nested Laplace approximations.,y
1833,"Social communication impairments are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and this class of symptoms is a target for treatments for the disorder. Measures of social attention, assessed via eye-gaze tracking (EGT), have been proposed as an early efficacy biomarker for clinical trials targeting social communication skills. EGT measures have been shown to differentiate children with ASD from typical children; however, there is less known about their relationships with social communication outcome measures that are typically used in ASD clinical trials. In the present study, an EGT task involving viewing a videotape of an actor making bids for a child's attention was evaluated in 25 children with ASD aged 24-72 months. Children's attention to the actor during the dyadic bid condition measured via EGT was found to be strongly associated with five well-validated caregiver-reported outcome measures that are commonly used to assess social communication in clinical trials. These results highlight the convergent validity of EGT measures of social attention in relation to caregiver-reported clinical measures. EGT holds promise as a non-invasive, quantitative, and objective biomarker that is associated with social communication abilities in children with ASD. Autism Res 2017,.

1834,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in which reduced social interest is a common symptom, such as autism, depression, and anxiety, are frequently associated with genetic mutations affecting GABAergic transmission. Benzodiazepine treatment, acting via GABAA receptors, improves social interaction in male mouse models with autism-like features. The protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) can act as an endogenous benzodiazepine, but a role for DBI in social behavior has not been described. Here we investigated the role of DBI in the social interest and recognition behavior of mice. The responses of DBI wild-type and knockout male and female mice to ovariectomized female wild-type mice (a neutral social stimulus) were evaluated in a habituation/dishabituation task. Both male and female knockout mice exhibited reduced social interest, and DBI knockout mice lacked the sex difference in social interest levels observed in wild-type mice, in which males showed higher social interest levels than females. The ability to discriminate between familiar and novel stimulus mice (social recognition) was not impaired in DBI-deficient mice of either sex. DBI knockouts could learn a rotarod motor task, and could discriminate between social and non-social odors. Both sexes of DBI knockout mice showed increased repetitive grooming behavior, but not in a manner that would account for the decrease in social investigation time. Genetic loss of DBI did not alter seminal vesicle weight, indicating that the social interest phenotype of males lacking DBI is not due to reduced circulating testosterone. Together, these studies reveal a novel role of DBI in driving social interest and motivation.",England,"Genes, brain, and behavior",29193847,2017,Genetic loss of diazepam binding inhibitor in mice impairs social interest.,y

1836,"Currently, the predominant hypothesis explains cellular differentiation and behaviour as an essentially genetically driven intracellular process, suggesting a gene-centrism paradigm. However, although many living species genetic has now been described, there is still a large gap between the genetic information interpretation and cell behaviour prediction. Indeed, the physical mechanisms underlying the cell differentiation and proliferation, which are now known or suspected to guide such as the flow of energy through cells and tissues, have been often overlooked. We thus here propose a complementary conceptual framework towards the development of an energy-oriented classification of cell properties, that is, a mitochondria-centrism hypothesis based on physical forces-driven principles. A literature review on the physical-biological interactions in a number of various biological processes is analysed from the point of view of the fluid and solid mechanics, electricity and thermodynamics. There is consistent evidence that physical forces control cell proliferation and differentiation. We propose that physical forces interfere with the cell metabolism mostly at the level of the mitochondria, which in turn control gene expression.

1838,"Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date there are limited options for treating this core symptomology. Treatments that stimulate adenosine A2A receptors may represent a promising approach for reducing RRBs in ASD. This is because A2A receptors are expressed on striatal neurons of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Under activation of this pathway has been associated with RRBs while activation of A2A receptors leads to increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway. The present studies investigated whether acute, systemic treatment with CGS21680, an A2A receptor agonist attenuates elevated self-grooming and a probabilistic reversal learning deficit in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf /J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism. The effects of this treatment were also investigated in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as a comparison strain. Using a spatial reversal learning test with 80/20 probabilistic feedback, comparable to one in which ASD individuals exhibit deficits, CGS 21680 (0.005 and 0.01mg/kg) attenuated a reversal learning deficit in BTBR mice. Enhancement in probabilistic reversal learning performance resulted from CGS 21680 improving the consistent maintenance of new adaptive behavioral choice patterns after reversal. CGS 21680 at 0.01 mg, but not 0.005 mg, also reduced self-grooming behavior in BTBR mice. CGS 21680 did not affect self-grooming or reversal learning in B6 mice.

A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment. The authors have developed software through which students can experience the practice of psychiatry (in particular, with dementia patients) in its entirety. This study compares this software with conventional learning methods.


METHOD
The control group was 43 fifth-year medical students in 2014 who studied using a conventional learning method (taking lectures and being in contact with actual patients). The experimental group was 36 fifth-year medical students in 2015 that used computer software (taking lectures and with reduced time in contact with actual patients). The authors compared the two groups. Each group was tested before and after clinical training on their acquisition of knowledge of dementia. The control group was tested in 2014, and the experimental group was tested in 2015.


RESULTS
The difference in average test scores between the two groups was statistically significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), with the experimental group scoring higher.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that students who were taught using a computer-based software method were better able to answer a standard series of questions designed to evaluate their understanding of dementia than those who were taught in a conventional manner.

Today we realise that those qualities which were thought to belong specifically to human beings, such as awareness, reason, memory and free will, can disappear. Should we conclude then that those whose capacities have decreased or disappeared have become less human or have even lost all human qualities?Such questioning leads to new ways of describing humans whereby they would be defined not in substantial but rather in interpersonal terms.Surely being a person means first and foremost that we live through and for others.

This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). Methods This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant, and one licensed practical nurse or activity staff. Family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff rated the resident's apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results The results revealed that ratings conducted by certified nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (râ€‰=â€‰0.47, pâ€‰=â€‰.08). None of the other AES ratings among family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were significantly correlated. Discussion Family and clinical caregivers were incongruent on their AES ratings of apathy. It remains undetermined which rater provides the most valid AES rating for residents with dementia. Findings from this study further highlight challenges in rating apathy in this population. Future research is needed to determine best practices for accurate apathy assessment for residents with dementia in long-term care.",England,"Dementia (London, England)",29192512,2017,Assessing apathy in long-term care residents with dementia: Who should be the rater?,y
1848,"The acute hospital admission of patients with dementia is associated with poor outcome and higher costs. Much of our knowledge on how hospital stays are experienced by patients and staff is generated from short and fragmented data collections, in which the significance of knowledge about day-to-day care might be overlooked, and might partly explain why the poor outcome for this group of patients is not fully understood. This study used participant observation to follow patients with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards after fall incidents. To gather longitudinal data, patients were followed during day and evening shifts, from admission to discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The data showed that, despite having little specific knowledge about dementia care, staff were able to gather information about the patient's needs and wishes relevant to administrating medicine in a person-centred way. However, much of this valuable information was lost between shifts or became hidden among the overwhelming amount of information in electronic patient records. As a consequence, much of the knowledge about individual patients' needs and wishes had to be collected all over again at every shift. The study concludes that careful handover of information on person-centred dementia care can play an important role in making hospital stays more dementia-friendly.",England,"Dementia (London, England)",29192513,2017,Medication and care in Alzheimer's patients in the acute care setting: A qualitative analysis.,y

To analyze the impact of measures undertaken to control brucellosis in the Republic of Macedonia on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the disease in humans.


METHODS
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients with brucellosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated at the University Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje during three time periods: 1989-1990 when no national strategy for disease control existed, 2000-2001 when some activities for control were performed and 2011-2014 when an organized and financially supported strategy was accomplished.


RESULTS
A drastic decrease of the number of cases of human brucellosis during the last period when compared to the first two ones (3.9 and 3.3 times lower, respectively) was evident. Patients from the third period were significantly older, with median age 41 years (range 4-73) vs. 31 years (3-77) and 34 years (1-74), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰.013). There were more males (86.6 vs. 73.6% and 63.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and the disease was more often acquired professionally (80.6 vs. 60.1% and 59.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.006).

1854,"BACKGROUND
Patients with brain lesions and resultant chronic aphasia frequently suffer from depression. However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial).


METHODS
In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test).


RESULTS
Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192534,2017,Intensive Communicative Therapy Reduces Symptoms of Depression in Chronic Nonfluent Aphasia.,y

Patients with neglect ignore or respond slower to contralesional stimuli. Neglect negatively influences independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most frequently studied treatments, yet there is little evidence regarding positive effects on neglect behavior in ADL.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether PA in the subacute phase ameliorates neglect in situations of varying complexity.


METHODS
A total of 70 neglect patients admitted for inpatient stroke rehabilitation received either PA or sham adaptation (SA) for 2 weeks, with full access to standard treatment. There were 7 time-dependent measurements (baseline and 1-4, 6, and 14 weeks after start of treatment). The primary outcome was change of neglect as observed during basic ADL with the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in performance on a dynamic multitask (ie, the Mobility Assessment Course [MAC]) and a static paper-and-pencil task (ie, a shape cancellation task [SC]).


RESULTS
In all, 34 patients received PA and 35 SA. There were significant time-dependent improvements in performance as measured with the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F > 15.57; P < .001). There was no significant difference in magnitude of improvement between groups on the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F < 2.54; P > .113].


CONCLUSIONS
No beneficial effects of PA over SA in the subacute phase poststroke were observed, which was comparable for situations of varying complexity. Heterogeneity of the syndrome, time post-stroke onset, and the content of treatment as usual are discussed.

To examine changes in breastfeeding rates in 0 to 6 month old infants in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, over the period from 2009 to 2015, for the total population as well as for various ethnic groups.

METHOD
Breastfeeding rates were examined for the period from 2009 to 2015 in 165,420 registrations of 75,543 infants at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for the entire Amsterdam population and for various ethnic groups. Differences were analysed using Ï‡2 tests.


RESULTS
The weighted percentage of total breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding as well as a combination of breast and formula feeding) increased in the entire Amsterdam study population over the period from 2009 to 2015 (2 weeks: 87.8% to 89.1%; 3 months: 61.6% to 63.6%; 6 months: 39.5% to 42.2%). Increases were mainly the result of increases in weighted percentages for exclusive breastfeeding.

Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic influences on diurnal preference have exclusively included subjects of European ancestry. This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs. Genetic risk score (GRS) profiling detected shared genetic risk between evening preference and related disorders. Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012.

1864,"OBJECTIVE
Regenerated peripheral nervous tissue possesses different morphometric properties compared to undisrupted nerve. It is poorly understood how these morphometric differences alter the response of the regenerated nerve to electrical stimulation. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the electrophysiological response of regenerated and undisrupted nerve axons to electrical stimulation delivered by macro-sieve electrodes (MSEs).


APPROACH
A 3D finite element model of a peripheral nerve segment populated with mammalian myelinated axons and implanted with a macro-sieve electrode has been developed. Fiber diameters and morphometric characteristics representative of undisrupted or regenerated peripheral nervous tissue were assigned to core conductor models to simulate the two tissue types. Simulations were carried out to quantify differences in thresholds and chronaxie between undisrupted and regenerated fiber populations. The model was also used to determine the influence of axonal caliber on recruitment thresholds for the two tissue types. Model accuracy was assessed through comparisons with in-vivo recruitment data from chronically implanted MSEs.


MAIN RESULTS
Recruitment thresholds of individual regenerated fibers with diameters &gt;2 Âµm were found to be lower compared to same caliber undisrupted fibers at electrode to fiber distances of less than about 90-140 Âµm but roughly equal or higher for larger distances. Caliber redistributions observed in regenerated nerve resulted in an overall increase in average recruitment thresholds and chronaxie during whole nerve stimulation. Modeling results also suggest that large diameter undisrupted fibers located close to a longitudinally restricted current source such as the MSE have higher average recruitment thresholds compared to small diameter fibers. In contrast, large diameter regenerated nerve fibers located in close proximity of MSE sites have, on average, lower recruitment thresholds compared to small fibers. Utilizing regenerated fiber morphometry and caliber distributions resulted in accurate predictions of in-vivo recruitment data.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our work uses computational modeling to show how morphometric differences between regenerated and undisrupted tissue results in recruitment threshold discrepancies, quantifies these differences, and illustrates how large undisrupted nerve fibers close to longitudinally restricted current sources have higher recruitment thresholds compared to adjacently positioned smaller fibers while the opposite is true for large regenerated fibers.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192607,2017,Modelling the impact of altered axonal morphometry on the response of regenerative nervous tissue to electrical stimulation through macro-sieve electrodes.,y
1865,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this work is to improve the state of the art for motor-control with a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs use neurological recording devices and a decoding algorithms to transform brain activity directly into real-time control of a machine, archetypically a robotic arm or a cursor. The standard procedure treats neural activity--vectors of spike counts in small temporal windows--as noisy observations of the kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration) of the fingertip. Inferring the state from the observations then takes the form of a \emph{dynamical filter}, typically some variant on Kalman's (KF). The KF, however, although fairly robust in practice, is optimal only when the relationships between variables are linear and the noise is Gaussian, conditions usually violated in practice.


APPROACH
To overcome these limitations we introduce a new filter, the ""recurrent exponential-family harmonium"" (rEFH), that models the spike counts explicitly as Poisson-distributed, and allows for arbitrary nonlinear dynamics and observation models. Furthermore, the model underlying the filter is acquired through unsupervised learning, which allows temporal correlations in spike counts to be explained by latent dynamics that do not necessarily correspond to the kinematic state of the fingertip.


MAIN RESULTS
We test the rEFH on offline reconstruction of the kinematics of reaches in the plane. The rEFH outperforms the standard, as well as three other state-of-the-art, decoders, across three monkeys, two different tasks, most kinematic variables, and a range of bin widths, amounts of training data, and numbers of neurons.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our algorithm establishes a new state of the art for offline decoding of reaches---in particular, for fingertip velocities, the variable used for control in most online decoders.&#13.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192609,2017,"Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm.",y

This study examines the use of the number of night-time sleep disturbances as a health-based metric to assess the cost effectiveness of rail noise mitigation strategies for situations, wherein high-intensity noises dominate such as freight train pass-bys and wheel squeal.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty residential properties adjacent to the existing and proposed rail tracks in a noise catchment area of the Epping to Thornleigh Third Track project were used as a case study. Awakening probabilities were calculated for individual's awakening 1, 3 and 5 times a night when subjected to 10 independent freight train pass-by noise events using internal maximum sound pressure levels (LAFmax).


RESULTS
Awakenings were predicted using a random intercept multivariate logistic regression model. With source mitigation in place, the majority of the residents were still predicted to be awoken at least once per night (median 88.0%), although substantial reductions in the median probabilities of awakening three and five times per night from 50.9 to 29.4% and 9.2 to 2.7%, respectively, were predicted. This resulted in a cost-effective estimate of 7.6-8.8 less people being awoken at least three times per night per A$1 million spent on noise barriers.


CONCLUSION
The study demonstrates that an easily understood metric can be readily used to assist making decisions related to noise mitigation for large-scale transport projects.",India,Noise & health,29192613,2017,A Health-Based Metric for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Noise Barrier Mitigation Associated With Transport Infrastructure Noise.,y
1868,"CONTEXT
According to the attention restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors.


AIMS
By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50-min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40â€‰min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were re-tested. The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately re-tested. The difference between the two test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents the attention restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig.â€‰=â€‰0.027 (<0.050)].


RESULTS
The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95%) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8.4), 'traffic sounds group' (2.4) and 'machine sounds group' (-1.8).


CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, have a positive effect on the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration.",India,Noise & health,29192615,2017,Effects of Soundscape on the Environmental Restoration in Urban Natural Environments.,y
1869,"INTRODUCTION
Hyperacusis is defined as a reduction in tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Hyperacusis can occur in individuals of all age groups, making daily life difficult for the sufferers. Although there is no objective test to accurately diagnose hyperacusis, questionnaires are useful for the assessment of hyperacusis. The aim of this study was to explore the reduced sound tolerance in university students using a hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 536 university students (300 females and 236 males) aged between 18 and 25 years, with a mean age of 21.34â€‰Â±â€‰1.87 years, were assessed using an HQ developed by Khalfa. The mean total score of all the participants was 16.34â€‰Â±â€‰7.91, and 5.78% of the participants had total scores indicating hyperacusis, where a majority of them were females.


RESULTS
Females had significantly higher scores than men in terms of both the total and the attentional and emotional dimensions. The scores of the participants who reported noise exposure or a decrease in their tolerance to noise were significantly higher than those of the other participants. Even among young adults, there was a group of participants suffering from some problems related to decreased tolerance to everyday sounds.


DISCUSSION
Although the Turkish translation of the HQ seems to be a reliable tool for evaluating hyperacusis in young adults, further work with various populations of different age groups is required to establish validity and to assess the psychometric qualities of the Turkish form.",India,Noise & health,29192616,2017,Assessment of Reduced Tolerance to Sound (Hyperacusis) in University Students.,y
1870,"OBJECTIVE
Children's own ratings and opinions on their schools sound environments add important information on noise sources. They can also provide information on how to further improve and optimize children's learning situation in their classrooms. This study reports on the Swedish translation and application of an evidence-based questionnaire that measures how children perceive the acoustic environment of their school.


STUDY DESIGN
The Swedish version was made using a back-to-back translation. Responses on the questionnaire along with demographic data were collected for 149 children aged 9-13 years of age.


RESULTS
The Swedish translation of the questionnaire can be reduced from 93 to 27 items. The 27 items were distributed over five separate factors measuring different underlying constructs with high internal consistency and high inter-item correlations. The responses demonstrated that the dining hall/canteen and the corridors are the school spaces with the poorest listening conditions. The highest annoyance was reported for tests and reading; next, student-generated sounds occur more frequently within the classroom than any sudden unexpected sounds, and finally, road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms are the most frequently occurring sounds from outside the classroom. Several demographic characteristics could be used to predict the outcome on these factors.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that crowded spaces are most challenging; the children themselves generate most of the noise inside the classroom, but it is also common to hear road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms. The extent of annoyance that noise causes depends on the task but seems most detrimental in tasks, wherein the demands of verbal processing are higher. Finally, children with special support seem to report that they are more susceptible to noise than the typical child.",India,Noise & health,29192618,2017,How Children Perceive the Acoustic Environment of Their School.,y
1871,"BACKGROUND
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is fast becoming a global epidemic, and its prevalence is increasing in children and young adults. The aim of the study was to identify young adults who had type 2 DM or impaired fasting glucose as well as those at risk of these conditions using anthropometric data and behavioral pattern.


METHODOLOGY
Two hundred and twenty newly admitted undergraduates who were randomly selected during the registration process were involved in the study. Anthropometric parameters were measured while information on demographic details, medical history, and family history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method.


RESULTS
Two hundred and seven (94%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4%) had serum glucose> 7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2%) had body mass index <25.0 while 6.8% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day.


CONCLUSION
Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192627,2017,Behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes mellitus among newly admitted undergraduates in a Nigerian University.,y

Seizures are common reasons for neurologic consultations and investigations. In the absence of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scanning of the brain is a reliable and cheaper alternative. Little is known about the pattern of brain lesions in patients with recurrent seizures in Nigeria.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the pattern of significant intracerebral lesions in patients presenting with recurrent seizures in a tertiary hospital in Enugu.


METHODS
All the medical and computer tomography records of patients with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent seizures were reviewed. The study duration was 11 years (January 2003 to December 2013). Relevant data were obtained and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 and GraphPad Prism 6.


RESULTS
The diagnostic yield of CT was 55.1%. Twenty (9.3%) individuals had two lesions each. The significant findings were tumors (20.4%), encephalomalacia (18.9%) and strokes (7.7% (ischemic stroke, 4.1%, intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.1%, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.5%). Hydrocephalus (HCP) was found in 18 (9.2%) cases, and 30% of them occurred together with other lesions. The diagnostic yield increased with age reaching 84.4% from the age of 60 years. Only patients with encephalomalacia were statistically older than those with normal imaging.


CONCLUSION
Computed tomography scan has a high diagnostic yield, especially in elderly patients with recurrent generalized seizures. Brain tumors, encephalomalacia, and HCP are most common causes of recurrent seizures in the adults.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192634,2017,"The Pattern of significant lesions found in computerized tomography scan of recurrent seizure patients at a center in Enugu, Nigeria.",y

Obesity can lead to psychological, social, and medical problems that may negatively affect the quality of life Aim: In our study, we aimed to evaluate the body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life of obese subjects in comparison with normal weighted ones.


METHODS
A total of 494 subjects, aged between 18 and 64 years, were included to the study. Patients with the body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥18.5-24.9 kg/m2 were assigned to the control group; BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 were assigned to the obese patient group. An ethical committee approval with protocol No. of 2011/242 was obtained from the Ethical Committee of EskiÅŸehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine. Interviews were performed two times with obese subjects in the 1st and the 6th month of weight loss program, once with the control group. Data identification form, the form which included the biochemical parameters, Trait Anxiety inventory, State anxiety scale, Quality of Life scale-Short Form [(SF-36)(QOL)], Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), Zung Depression Rating Scale, and Zung Anxiety Rating Scale were applied to participants.


RESULTS
Obesity is more common in women. Obesity reduces the quality of life, negatively affects body perception, and triggers anxiety. Because of their body structure, obese individuals are exposed to social pressure and unethical attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Both health risks and social implications of obesity are important. Further studies are needed to ethically evaluate the psycho-social problems caused by obesity.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192636,2017,"Assessment of body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life among obese and nonobese subjects in Turkey.",y

This review aimed to explore the most contemporary evidence on whether poor oral health and dementia occurs in the same individuals or populations, to outline the nature of the relationship between these two health outcomes and to discuss the implication of any findings for health services and future research. The review was undertaken by a working group comprising consultant clinicians from medicine and dentistry, trainees, public health and academic staff. Whilst other rapid reviews in the current series limited their search to systematic reviews, this review focused on primary research involving cohort and case-control studies because of the lack of high level evidence in this new and important field. The results suggest that poor oral hygiene is associated with dementia, and more so amongst people in advanced stages of the disease.

We investigated the understanding of terminology commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine clinics.Methods We investigated patients' understanding using a questionnaire-based study in the out-patient setting. Age, gender, first language and highest educational level were recorded. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions regarding patients' understanding of words as well as asking patients to define certain terms. Vocabulary included 'ulcer', 'blister', 'cancer', 'malignant' and 'benign'.Results and conclusions Many patients have difficulty in understanding and explaining commonly used terminology. 'Blister' was the most commonly understood term, while 'benign' and 'lesion' were the least well understood. 'Tumour' was mistakenly thought of as synonymous with 'malignancy' by over a third of patients. Understanding was better among those for whom English was their first language. It is essential that all clinicians modify their language appropriately during consultations in order to deliver information in a comprehensive manner, to educate patients on their condition thus enabling informed decision making by patients.",England,British dental journal,29192691,2017,Patient understanding of commonly used oral medicine terminology.,y

RESULTS
We had a 44% response rate at 9 months after birth or loss from 377 bereaved mothers and 232 with surviving infants. Bereaved women were less likely to have hospital staff or family members present at delivery. African-American (versus Caucasian) mothers were half as likely to have first heard about their stillbirth from a physician or midwife.

Although incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms appears to be a barrier to successful self-care, there are few studies examining the relationship between self-care and levels of comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.


AIM
To determine whether incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms is associated with self-care in heart failure patients who were recently discharged from the hospital due to heart failure exacerbation.


METHODS
Patients completed the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale and questionnaire to assess knowledge of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Three groups were formed by their different levels of understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether these three levels of understanding groups predicted self-care after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.


RESULTS
Of 571 patients 22.1%, 40.1% and 37.8% had poor, moderate, and complete understanding, respectively. Compared with patients in the poor understanding group, patients in complete and moderate understanding groups were more likely to have better adherence to self-care activities (standardized Î² = -0.14, 95% confidence interval -3.41, -0.47; standardized Î² = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -4.26, -1.23, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS

To maximise the benefits obtainable from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, an evaluation of physical fitness using reliable, clinically relevant tests is strongly recommended. Recently, objective tests of physical fitness have been implemented in the SWEDEHEART register. The reliability of these tests has, however, not been examined for patients with acute coronary syndrome.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of the symptom-limited bicycle ergometer test, the dynamic unilateral heel-lift test and the unilateral shoulder-flexion test in patients with acute coronary syndrome.


METHODS
In a longitudinal study design, a total of 40 patients (mean age 63.8 Â± 9.5 years, five women), with ACS, aged < 75 years, were included at a university hospital in Sweden. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval, standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsiveness in terms of the minimal detectable change were calculated.


RESULTS
Excellent reliability was found, showing ICC values of 0.98 (0.96-0.99), SEM 4.71 for the bicycle ergometer test, ICC 0.87 (0.75-0.93), SEM 4.62 for the shoulder-flexion test and ICC 0.84 (0.71-0.91), SEM 2.24 for the heel-lift test. The minimal detectable change was 13 W, 13 and 6 repetitions for the bicycle ergometer test, shoulder-flexion and heel-lift tests respectively.

1886,"Introduction Hypertension is one of the primary modifiable risk factors for cardiac and renal diseases. The prevalence of hypertension appears to be around 30-45% of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The administration of blood pressure-lowering drugs is to reduce the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes: stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths. Hypertension guidelines recommend combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk and with subclinical organ damage as well as when monotherapy fails. Areas covered As the etiology of essential hypertension is multifactorial, combination therapy using different classes of antihypertensive agents have greater effect than each on its own (synergistic effect), may have better tolerability (two components minimizing each other's side effects) and lead to improved patient compliance. Several studies assess the hypotensive efficacy on drug combination, there are also studies n triple drug combination. Expert commentary At present, dual and triple combination therapy is available to hypertensive patients with good clinical outcomes, compliance and low profile of side effects. Hypertensive patients usually have other cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. As patients' adherence to the pharmacological therapy significantly decreases the risk of long-term adverse events including mortality, use of single-pill combination therapy are not only good effects of free therapy but also better patient compliance. It appears that combinations not only of hypotensive drugs but also with statins will be widely used.

This study A) assessed whether levels of alcohol-related disciplinary actions on college campuses changed among MD college students after the 2011 Maryland (MD) state alcohol tax increase from 6% to 9%, and B) determined which school-level factors impacted the magnitude of changes detected.


METHOD
A quasi-experimental interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of panel data containing alcohol-related disciplinary actions on 33 MD college campuses in years 2006-2013. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in counts of alcohol-related disciplinary actions comparing time before and after the tax increase.


RESULTS
The ITS anaysis showed an insignificant relationship between alcohol-related disciplinary actions and tax implementation (Î² = -.27; p =.257) but indicated that alcohol-related disciplinary actions decreased significantly over the time under study (Î² = -.05; p =.022).


DISCUSSION
Alcohol related disciplinary actions did decrease over time in the years of study, and this relationship was correlated with several school-level characteristics, including school price, school funding type, types of degrees awarded, and specialty.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques.


METHODS
Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6Â mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28Â days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations.


RESULTS
FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions.

1890,"Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths.

1893,The amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insights into AÎ²-interacting proteins are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity. We recently undertook an in-depth in vitro interrogation of the AÎ²1-42 interactome using human frontal lobes as the biological source material and taking advantage of advances in mass spectrometry performance characteristics. These analyses uncovered the small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) to be the most selectively enriched binder to oligomeric AÎ²1-42. Subsequent validation experiments revealed that SST interferes with AÎ² fibrillization and promotes the formation of AÎ² assemblies characterized by a 50-60Â kDa SDS-resistant core. The distributions of SST and AÎ² overlap in the brain and SST has been linked to AD by several additional observations. This perspective summarizes this body of literature and draws attention to the fact that SST is one of several neuropeptide hormones that acquire amyloid properties before their synaptic release. The latter places the interaction between SST and AÎ² among an increasing number of observations that attest to the ability of amyloidogenic proteins to influence each other. A model is presented which attempts to reconcile existing data on the involvement of SST in the AD etiology.,United States,Prion,29192843,2017,Somatostatin in Alzheimer'S disease: A new Role for an Old Player.,y

1895,"OBJECTIVE The acquisition and refinement of cognitive and behavioral skills during development is associated with the maturation of various brain oscillatory activities. Most developmental investigations have identified distinct patterns of low-frequency electrophysiological activity that are characteristic of various behavioral milestones. In this investigation, the authors focused on the cross-sectional developmental properties of high-frequency spectral power from the brain's default mode network (DMN) during goal-directed behavior. METHODS The authors contrasted regionally specific, time-evolving high gamma power (HGP) in the lateral DMN cortex between 3 young children (age range 3-6 years) and 3 adults by use of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings over the left perisylvian cortex during a picture-naming task. RESULTS Across all participants, a nearly identical and consistent response suppression of HGP, which is a functional signature of the DMN, was observed during task performance recordings acquired from ECoG electrodes placed over the lateral DMN cortex. This finding provides evidence of relatively early maturation of the DMN. Furthermore, only HGP relative to evoked alpha and beta band power showed this level of consistency across all participants. CONCLUSIONS Regionally specific, task-evoked suppression of the high-frequency components of the cortical power spectrum is established early in brain development, and this response may reflect the early maturation of specific cognitive and/or computational mechanisms.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

In Experiment 1, we asked participants to perform two tasks that varied in cognitive demands: transcription and exposition about an autobiographical episode. Lacunarity was significantly lower in transcription. In Experiment 2, we compared a veridical and a fictitious version of a personal event. Lacunarity was lower in veridical texts.

Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192871,2017,What Does the DAP:IQ Measure?: Drawing Comparisons between Drawing Performance and Developmental Assessments.,y

Despite the finding that the children's comprehension of antisocial teasing tended to exceed their comprehension of prosocial teasing, the findings indicate that being relatively young (i.e., 5-6Â years old vs. 7-8Â years old) and having relatively frequent experience with antisocial teasing in the home may be associated with some children's difficulty in recognizing the intent behind antisocial teases.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192874,2017,Young Children's ability to Discriminate between Antisocial and Prosocial Teases.,y
1900,"OBJECTIVE Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, more patients with a high body mass index (BMI) will require surgical treatment for degenerative spinal disease. In previous investigations of lumbar spine pathology, obesity has been associated with worsened postoperative outcomes and increased costs. However, few studies have examined the association between BMI and postoperative outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes, postoperative narcotics consumption, complications, and hospital costs among BMI stratifications for patients who have undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF procedures. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained surgical database of patients who had undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spinal pathology between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified by BMI as follows: normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), or obese II-III (â‰¥ 35.0 kg/m2). Differences in patient demographics and preoperative characteristics were compared across the BMI cohorts using 1-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Multivariate linear or Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine the presence of an association between BMI category and narcotics utilization, improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores, incidence of complications, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, and hospital costs. Regression analyses were controlled for preoperative demographic and procedural characteristics. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients were included in the analysis, of whom 20.9% (n = 58) were normal weight, 37.5% (n = 104) were overweight, 24.9% (n = 69) were obese I, and 16.6% (n = 46) were obese II-III. A higher BMI was associated with an older age (p = 0.049) and increased comorbidity burden (p = 0.001). No differences in sex, smoking status, insurance type, diagnosis, presence of neuropathy, or preoperative VAS pain scores were found among the BMI cohorts (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found among these cohorts as regards operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and number of operative levels (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in postoperative narcotics consumption, VAS score improvement, complication rates, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, or total direct costs existed across BMI stratifications (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher BMI demonstrated surgical outcomes, narcotics consumption, and hospital costs comparable to those of patients with a lower BMI. Thus, ACDF procedures are both safe and effective for all patients across the entire BMI spectrum. Patients should be counseled to expect similar rates of postoperative complications and eventual clinical improvement regardless of their BMI.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

1901,"In response to varying stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor is able to promote repair, survival, or elimination of damaged cells - processes that have great relevance to organismal aging. Although the link between p53 and cancer is well established, the contribution of p53 to the aging process is less clear. Delineating how p53 regulates distinct aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered metabolic pathways will be critical. Mouse models have further revealed the centrality and complexity of the p53 network in aging processes. While naturally aged mice have linked longevity with declining p53 function, some accelerated aging mice present with chronic p53 activation, whose phenotypes can be rescued upon p53 deficiency. Further, direct modulation of the p53-MDM2 axis has correlated elevated p53 activity with either early aging or with delayed-onset aging. We speculate that p53-mediated aging phenotypes in these mice must have (1) stably active p53 due to MDM2 dysregulation or chronic stress or (2) shifted p53 outcomes. Pinpointing which p53 stressors, modifications, and outcomes drive aging processes will provide further insights into our understanding of the human aging process and could have implications for both cancer and aging therapeutics.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cdd.2017.187.",England,Cell death and differentiation,29192902,2017,Relevance of the p53-MDM2 axis to aging.,y

In recent years, the recovery-oriented approaches (along with experiences and thoughts of patients and patient's relatives) have been taken into account for establishing mental health services and policies. This study aims to identify the factors contributing to recovery, as observed from the perspective of schizophrenia patients working at The Blue Horse CafÃ© which was founded by the Federation of Schizophrenia Associations.


METHOD
The sample for the study consisted of 24 patients who worked at The Blue Horse CafÃ©. A phenomenological approach was used in the study, whereby interviews with patients were analyzed qualitatively.


RESULTS
Certain common factors, which were expressed as having contributed to recovery, were identified from the perspective of schizophrenia patients. These factors are: 1-The fact that the setting is informal and welcoming without being constrictive; 2-Predominance of the human element; 3-Hope and encouragement; 4-Being cared about; 5-Being able to reach someone when in need of support; 6-Friendly sharing; 7-Having a purpose, assuming responsibility, and being motivated; and 8-Giving meaning to life.


CONCLUSION
The findings may serve as a stimulus since schizophrenia patients that contribute to recovery give mental health professionals the opportunity to question there need for a change in their professional roles. Additionally, schizophrenia patients that have experienced The Blue Horse CafÃ© draw attention to certain points and these points can serve as a guide, especially for establishing the working METHODS of Community Mental Health Centers.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192939,2017,[Lessons Learned from Experiencing Mavi At CafÃ© (Blue Horse CafÃ©) during Six Years: A Qualitative Analysis of Factors Contributing to Recovery from the Perspective of Schizophrenia Patients].,y

Impairment in immune functions is proposed as a key factor in the cognitive decline in bipolar disorder (BD) however there is scarcity of research on the impact of inflammation on cognitive functions. Our aim is to compare IL-18 and IL-6 levels in BD patients and controls and to study the relationship between IL-18 and IL-6 levels and cognitive impairment METHOD: Thirty-six euthymic BD-I patients and 38 age, sex and educational level matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants were evaluated with neurocognitive tests. The plasma IL-6 and IL-18 levels of both groups were measured with ELISA kits.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between IL-6 and IL-18 levels of patient and healthy control groups. In the patient group, IL-18 level was positively correlated with completed categories score wheras there was a negative correlation with perseverative response and perseverative errors. Moreover IL-18 level was positively correlated with immediate recall, delayed recall and learning scores while there was a negative correlation with stroop interference scores. No correlation was found between IL-6 level and neuropsychological test scores in the patient group.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study that investigates the relation of IL-18 with cognitive functions. Possible detrimental or protective effects of IL-18 in BD is not yet clear, however the positive association of IL-18 level and neuropsychological test scores might indicate a neuroprotective role of IL-18 in the euthymic period of BD which is the closest state to physiological condition.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192940,2017,[The Relationship of Interleukin-18 and Interleukin-6 Levels with Cognitive Functions in Bipolar Disorder].,y

METHODS
For clarifying this we searched for three polymorphisms (Arg199/His, Ser75/Asn, and Ile49/Val) in carboxylesterase-1 gene (CES-1) in the saliva of patients diagnosed with PDD+ADHD. Also, we assessed the clinical response to MPH by dimensional approach using the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale.

The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between shyness, perception of general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction in young adolescents.


METHOD
The study participants included 489 freshman students living in Turkey and studying under different faculty at public universities in Ankara (184 female; 37.6% and 305 male; 62.4%). The subjects ranged in age between 18 (n = 207; 42.3%) and 19 (n = 282; 57.7%) years.

This study aimed to examine the cognitive profiles of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the latter of which was recently standardized in Turkey. In addition, the reading abilities and intelligence scores of these children were also investigated.


METHODS
A total of 48 children with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 16 years who were outpatients in MuÅŸ State Hospital were included in this study. The children were administered the WISC-R, the WISC-IV, and the Oral Reading Skills and Reading Comprehension Test (ORCT).


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the WISC-R IQ scores and WISC-IV index scores. Moreover, reading comprehension skills (derived from ORCT scores) were predicted with significant accuracy by both the WISC-R Verbal IQ and the WISC-IV WMI (Working Memory Index).


CONCLUSION
Results of this study suggest that the WISC-R and the WISC-IV scale are not sufficient for obtaining a specific cognitive profile for ADHD - there is no significant difference between them. However, the four-factor structure of the WISC-IV is believed to provide more specific information. In addition, results of this study related to reading skills indicate that the importance of reading skills should not be overlooked when assessing children with ADHD.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192943,2017,[Comparing Two Editions of Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Assessing Reading Skills in Children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder].,y

We aimed to review the literature related to attention, memory, and executive functions in PTSD. Although studies on the subject are limited (in that there is no uniformity in terms of trauma type, selection of the control groups or types of neuropsychological tests used), most reported similar deficits in PTSD subjects in terms of memory and executive functions including attention. Since the presence of psychiatric comorbidities may disrupt neuropsychological functions, results of studies that have not controlled comorbidity may be questionable. However, studies that excluded the comorbid conditions reported similar deficits in cognitive functions in PTSD patients. The relationship between recovery from PTSD symptoms and change in cognitive functions has been examined in only a few studies, and most have reported an improvement for both memory and executive functions in remitted patients. The improvement in executive functions, however, has been limited by the difficulty of task. Cognitive deficits have been among the major causes of disabilities in PTSD patients.

FL damage can lead to executive dysfunction by influencing frontal-subcortical circuits (dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, ventromedial). Damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can lead to deterioration in EF, whereas damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) can lead to personality changes with the characteristic of disinhibition and irritability. In addition, damage to the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) can result in decreased spontaneity. Neuropsychological tests are important components in the assessment of EF including goal-directed behavior, decision-making, risk assessment, making plans for the future, setting of priorities and order of our actions. Clinical conditions affecting frontal-subcortical connections outside of the FL can also lead to executive dysfunctions and frontal lobe syndrome (FLS).

Dementia-related behavioral symptoms and functional dependence result in poor quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The goal was to determine whether a home-based activity program (Tailored Activity Program; TAP-VA) would reduce behavioral symptoms and functional dependence of veterans with dementia and caregiver burden.


DESIGN
Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).


SETTING
Veteran's homes.


PARTICIPANTS
Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).


INTERVENTION
Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.


MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.


RESULTS
Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control). At 4 months, compared to controls, the TAP-VA group showed reductions in number (difference in mean change from baseline = -0.68, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.13) and frequency by severity (-24.3, 95% CI = -45.6 to -3.1) of behavioral symptoms, number of activities needing assistance with (-0.80, 95% CI = -1.41 to -0.20), functional dependence level (4.09, 95% CI = 1.06, 7.13), and pain (-1.18, 95% CI = -2.10 to -0.26). Caregivers of veterans in TAP-VA reported less behavior-related distress. Benefits did not extend to 8 months.

Smoke-free laws reduce disease prevalence. The impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky was examined. The authors hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of smoke-free laws.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of 83,727 Kentucky residents agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50 years who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 1995 to 2014. In 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free laws. County-level characteristics included adult smoking rate, sex, race/ethnicity, income, physician supply, observed radon values, and rurality.


RESULTS
Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The difference in lung cancer incidence between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws did not confer the same benefit. One hundred percent smoke-free laws, covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions, may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.

For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62 Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs, economic returns and chances of success of investments in different tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect varied substantially by parental social class and level of education. The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates increased their participation in more rewarding university fields. Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects. Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.",England,The British journal of sociology,29193014,2017,Information barriers and social stratification in higher education: evidence from a field experiment.,y

To examine the diagnostic ability of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <36wks postmenstrual age) to detect later adverse motor outcomes or cerebral palsy (CP) in infants born preterm.


METHOD
Studies of infants born preterm with MRI earlier than 36 weeks postmenstrual age and quantitative motor data or a diagnosis of CP at or beyond 1 year corrected age were identified. Study details were extracted and meta-analyses performed where possible. Quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 (a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies).


RESULTS
Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which reported diagnostic accuracy and five reported data sufficient for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. Early structural MRI global scores detected a later diagnosis of CP with a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86-100) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 59-100). Global structural MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 44-100) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 90-100). White matter scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 20-48) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 78-88).


INTERPRETATION
Early structural MRI has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine adverse motor outcomes and CP in infants born preterm. Greater reporting of diagnostic accuracy in studies examining relationships with motor outcomes and CP is required to facilitate clinical utility of early MRI.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine later adverse motor outcomes and cerebral palsy (CP). Detection of infants who progressed to CP was stronger than motor outcomes. Global MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes more accurately than white matter scores.

To examine the factors contributing to nurses choosing to exit the nursing profession before retirement age.


BACKGROUND
Population growth, ageing and growing demand for health services mean increased demand for nurses. Better retention could help meet this demand, yet little work has been done in New Zealand to understand early attrition.


METHODS
An online survey of registered and enrolled nurses and nurse practitioners who had left nursing was used. This study reports analysis of responses from 285 ex-nurses aged under 55.


FINDINGS
The primary reasons nurses left the profession were as follows: workplace concerns; personal challenges; career factors; family reasons; lack of confidence; leaving for overseas; unwillingness to complete educational requirements; poor work-life balance; and inability to find suitable nursing work. Most nurses discussed their intentions to leave with a family member or manager and most reported gaining transferrable skills through nursing.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses leave for many reasons. Implementing positive practice environments and individualized approaches to retaining staff may help reduce this attrition. Generational changes in the nature of work and careers mean that nurses may continue to leave the profession sooner than anticipated by policymakers.


IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
If the nursing workforce is to be able to meet projected need, education, recruitment and retention policies must urgently address issues leading to early attrition. In particular, policies improving the wider environmental context of nursing practice and ensuring that working environments are safe and nurses are well supported must be developed and implemented. Equally, national nursing workforce planning must take into account that nursing is no longer viewed as a career for life.",England,International nursing review,29193041,2017,Early nurse attrition in New Zealand and associated policy implications.,y

1916,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic sleep deficiency is associated with early mortality. In the epileptic population, there is a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, and individuals with severe refractory epilepsy are at greater risk of premature mortality than the general population. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affects 1:1000 cases of epilepsy each year. Ketogenic diet (KD) treatment is one of the few effective options for refractory seizures. Despite KD reducing seizures and increasing longevity in Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, they still succumb to sudden death. This study aims to determine whether (1) the rest profiles of KO and KD-treated KO (KOKD) mice resemble each other as a function of either age or proximity to death and (2) the timing of death correlates with acute or chronic changes in rest.


METHODS
Noninvasive actimetry was used to monitor rest throughout the lives of KO and wild-type (WT) littermates administered standard diet or KD.


RESULTS
As KO mice age, rest is reduced (PÂ <Â .0001). Rest is significantlyÂ improved in KDKO mice (PÂ <Â .0001), resembling WT values at several ages. When age is removed as a variable and data are realigned to the day of death, the rest profiles of KO and KOKD groups worsen to similar degrees as a function of proximity to death. The amount of rest acutely is not sensitive to the timing of death, whereas chronic rest deficiency profiles (10-15Â days prior to death) of both groups were indistinguishable. Chronic accumulation of rest deficiency over the final 15Â days was associated with 75% of deaths.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our data suggest that the accumulated rest deficiency is associated with sudden death in Kv1.1 KO mice. These data (1) support the proposed clinical hypothesis that chronic sleep deficiency may be associated with early mortality in epileptic patients and (2) warrant future preclinical and clinical studies on sleep monitoring in epileptic patients.",United States,Epilepsia,29193044,2017,"Accumulation of rest deficiency precedes sudden death of epileptic Kv1.1 knockout mice, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",y

1919,"OBJECTIVE
Using a ""double-pulse"" adaptation paradigm, in which two stimuli are presented in quick succession, this study examines the neural mechanisms underlying potentiation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in visual snow syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous ""double-pulse"" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.


METHODS
We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.


RESULTS
In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",United States,Headache,29193050,2017,Antagonistic Relationship Between VEP Potentiation and Gamma Power in Visual Snow Syndrome.,y
1920,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies show migraineurs are at an increased risk of developing suicidal behaviors, even after controlling for comorbid depression. However, previous research has not examined the impact of psychiatric mood disorders on suicidal behaviors in migraineurs within a nationally representative sample.


OBJECTIVE
A cross-sectional study was used to investigate the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors and determine whether psychiatric comorbidities modify this association in a nationwide inpatient cohort.


METHODS
We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations compiled from USA billing data. Migraine, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric disorders were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes from hospitalization discharges (2007-2012). Weighted national estimates were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
156,172,826 hospitalizations were included, of which 1.4% had a migraine diagnosis and 1.6% had a diagnosis of suicidal behavior. Migraineurs had a 2.07-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.96-2.19) compared with non-migraineurs. We repeated analyses after stratifying by depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among hospitalizations with depression, migraine was associated with a 20% reduced odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 0.76-0.85). Among hospitalizations without depression, migraine was associated with 2.35-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 2.20-2.51). In stratified analyses, we noted that among hospitalizations with anxiety, migraineurs had slightly increased odds of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.13). Among hospitalizations without anxiety, migraine was associated with a 2.06-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.94-2.20). Similarly, in analyses stratified by PTSD, migraine was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94-1.07) among those with PTSD. However, the odds of suicidal behaviors were increased among hospitalizations without PTSD (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.84-2.08).


CONCLUSION
Chronic conditions that do not affect the current hospitalization may not have been reported. The presence of psychiatric diagnoses influences associations of suicidal behaviors with migraine in a national inpatient sample. Migraineurs with diagnosed comorbid psychiatric disorders may be receiving care that mitigates their risk for suicidal behaviors.",United States,Headache,29193052,2017,Association Between Migraine and Suicidal Behaviors: A Nationwide Study in the USA.,y
1921,"Variation in the shape of the human face and in stature is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental influences. One such environmental influence is malnourishment, which can result in growth faltering, usually diagnosed by means of comparing an individual's stature with a set of age-appropriate standards. These standards for stature, however, are typically ascertained in groups where people are at low risk for growth faltering. Moreover, genetic differences among populations with respect to stature are well established, further complicating the generalizability of stature-based diagnostic tools. In a large sample of children aged 5-19 years, we obtained high-resolution genomic data, anthropometric measures and 3D facial images from individuals within and around the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. With genome-wide complex trait analysis, we partitioned genetic and environmental variance for growth outcomes and facial shape. We found that children with growth faltering have faces that look like those of older and taller children, in a direction opposite to the expected allometric trajectory, and in ways predicted by the environmental portion of covariance at the community and individual levels. The environmental variance for facial shape varied subtly but significantly among communities, whereas genetic differences were minimal. These results reveal that facial shape preserves information about exposure to undernourishment, with important implications for refining assessments of nutritional status in children and the developmental-genetics of craniofacial variation alike.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193055,2017,Facial shape manifestations of growth faltering in Tanzanian children.,y

Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive change resulting from challenging life events. The current study examined factors associated with PTG in traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.


METHOD
Participants (NÂ =Â 221) in this prospective cohort study included adults admitted to a Level I trauma center. Over half the participants (60%) were male, with a mean age of 47. Participants completed baseline measures during hospitalization. PTG was assessed at 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Greater PTG was associated with minority race/ethnicity, lower income, automotive collision, and premorbid psychological disorder other than depression or posttraumatic stress (PTS). These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients. Analysis confirmed that greater PTS at follow-up was associated with more growth.


CONCLUSION
Participants with the most growth also experienced the most distress.

Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED) and high- (HE), moderate- (ME) and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30 min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with Î±7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical Î±7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

The highest break points occurred during the token reinforcement condition for two out of three participants, but response rates tended to be higher with edibles. We then evaluated the effects of presession access to edibles on the break points of edible items and tokens with two participants. Break points decreased only in the edible reinforcement condition, and the participants chose to work for leisure items rather than edibles when presession access to edibles was in place.

In an Internet study, participants who first completed verbal attitude measures were more likely to donate to a Jewish organisation compared to those who completed the measures after making the decision to donate. Moreover, responses to attitude measures of various types and donating to the Jewish organisation were correlated when attitudes had been expressed in the first step. When attitudes were measured after the decision to donate, only the responses to the traditional anti-Semitic scale were correlated with this behaviour. In the field study, in which the time interval between attitude and behaviour measures was introduced, no question-behaviour effect was observed.

1926,"Auditory brainstem neurons are functionally primed to fire action potentials (APs) at markedly high-rates in order to rapidly encode acoustic information of sound. This specialization is critical for survival and the comprehension of behaviourally relevant communication functions, including sound localization and understanding speech in noise. Here, we investigated underlying ion channel mechanisms essential for high-rate AP firing in neurons of the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM) - the avian analog of bushy cells of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In addition to the established function of high-voltage activated potassium channels, we found that resurgent sodium current (INaR ) plays a role in regulating rapid firing activity of late-developing (embryonic [E] days 19-21) NM neurons. INaR of late-developing NM neurons showed similar properties with mammalian neurons in that its unique mechanism of an ""open channel block state"" facilitated the recovery and increased the availability of sodium (NaV ) channels after depolarization. Using a computational model of NM neurons, we demonstrated that removal of INaR reduced high-rate AP firing. We found weak INaR during a prehearing period (E11-12), which transformed to resemble late-developing INaR properties around hearing onset (E14-16). Anatomically, we detected strong NaV 1.6 expression near maturation, which became increasingly less distinct at hearing onset and prehearing periods, suggesting that multiple NaV channel subtypes may contribute to INaR during development. We conclude that INaR plays an important role in regulating rapid AP firing for NM neurons, a property that may be evolutionarily conserved for functions related to similar avian and mammalian hearing.

1927,"This study aimed to investigate whether variable patterns of responses can be acquired and maintained by negative reinforcement under an avoidance contingency. Six male Wistar rats were exposed to sessions in which behavioral variability was reinforced according to a Lag contingency: Sequences of three responses on two levers had to differ from one, two or three previous sequences for shocks to be avoided (Lag 1, Lag 2 and Lag 3, respectively). Performance under the Lag conditions was compared with performance on a Yoke condition in which the animals received the same reinforcement frequency and distribution as in the Lag condition but behavioral variability was not required. The results showed that most of the subjects varied their sequences under the Lag contingencies, avoiding shocks with relatively high probability (â‰¥ 0.7). Under the Yoke procedure, responding continued to occur with high probability, but the behavioral variability decreased. These results suggest that behavioral variability can be negatively reinforced.",United States,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,29193141,2017,Behavioral variability as avoidance behavior.,y
1928,"BACKGROUND
Exposure to alcohol content in movies has been shown to be associated with adolescent use of alcohol, including earlier onset. This study examined the influence of movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol onset, considering the social context (whether the movie was viewed with a friend or parent). We examined whether media's influence holds across a spectrum of early drinking milestones: sipping (but not consuming a full drink of) alcohol, consuming a full drink of alcohol, and engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED).


METHODS
Data were taken from a sample of 882 middle school youth (52% female; 24% non-White) enrolled in an ongoing study on alcohol initiation and progression. Exposure to alcohol content in films was measured using a method that combines content analysis and random assignment of movie titles to youth surveys. The hazard of initiating alcohol use (sip, full drink, HED) as a function of exposure was estimated using survival analysis. Associations were adjusted for demographic, personality, and social influence factors known to be associated with both movie exposure and alcohol use.


RESULTS
Exposure to alcohol content was common. Hours of exposure prospectively predicted earlier onset of alcohol involvement across all outcomes. Viewing movies with friends appeared to augment the media exposure effect, in contrast to viewing movies with parents, which was not a significant predictor of initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to alcohol in films is involved in the entry into early stages of alcohol involvement. Findings support further investigation into the role of the media in underage drinking, especially in the context of consuming media with friends and peers. Limiting media exposure and/or stronger Federal Trade Commission oversight of movie ratings should be a priority for preventing underage drinking.",England,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",29193150,2017,Exposure to Alcohol Content in Movies and Initiation of Early Drinking Milestones.,y

1930,"The primary goal of this study was to examine and describe the importance of childbearing as perceived by infertile women in the Chinese familial and social context. We adopted a qualitative descriptive method and conducted semi-structured interviews with female patients diagnosed with infertility. Participants were recruited at a high-volume fertility clinic in Tianjin, China. Fifteen women with a diagnosis of infertility were interviewed for 60-90â€‰min. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Two themes supported the importance of childbearing for Chinese women with infertility: childbearing as natural law, and childbearing for relational harmony. Childbearing as natural law referred to intrinsic forces to seek a child, including (i) achieving motherhood and womanhood and (ii) experiencing a developmental transition with childbearing as a landmark. Relational harmony included three primary factors: (i) to maintain marital quality by preventing marital failure and rejuvenating an unsatisfactory marital relationship; (ii) to fulfill both authoritative and reciprocal filial piety; (iii) to build a sense of normalcy within family and social networks. In summary, infertility resulted in loss of motherhood, womanhood, and a smooth developmental transition. Moreover, it threatened relationship harmony in the marriage, family, and social life. These insights on the value of childbearing in the Chinese context can inform healthcare professionals in identify infertility-related demands and developing relevant psychosocial services for people with infertility.",United States,Research in nursing & health,29193167,2017,Childbearing importance: A qualitative study of women with infertility in China.,y

As the workforce ages, occupational injuries from falls on the same level will increase. Some industries may be more affected than others.

We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate same-level fall injury incidence rates by age group, gender, and industry for four sectors: 1) healthcare and social assistance; 2) manufacturing; 3) retail; and 4) transportation and warehousing. We calculated rate ratios and rate differences by age group and gender.


RESULTS
Same-level fall injury incidence rates increase with age in all four sectors. However, patterns of rate ratios and rate differences vary by age group, gender, and industry. Younger workers, men, and manufacturing workers generally have lower rates.

1932,"Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of emerging infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour changes on epidemics can be key to improving control efforts. However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases. Therefore, in terms of mitigating emerging infectious diseases, both media publicity focused on how to guide people's behaviour change and positive responses of individuals are critical.",England,Statistics in medicine,29193194,2017,Impact of individual behaviour change on the spread of emerging infectious diseases.,y

While it is known that informal caregiving is associated with care-derived self-esteem cross-sectionally, little is known about the impact of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. Thus, we aimed at examining whether informal caregiving affects general self-esteem using a longitudinal approach.


METHODS
Data were gathered from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 40 and over in Germany from 2002 to 2014 (n = 21 271). General self-esteem was quantified using the Rosenberg scale. Individuals were asked whether they provide informal care regularly.


RESULTS
Fixed effects regressions showed no significant effect of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. General self-esteem decreased with increasing morbidity, increasing age, decreasing social ties, whereas it was not associated with changes in employment status, marital status and body mass index. Additional models showed that decreases in self-esteem were associated with decreases in functional health and increases in depressive symptoms.

The older persons lacked knowledge about their condition, which generated poor insight into their medical treatment and this in turn affected their daily life. They had thoughts and questions about their medication, but did not have an opportunity to ask the questions because of lack of follow-up from the healthcare system.

1936,"Animals maintained in captivity exhibit rapid changes in phenotypic traits, which may be maladaptive for natural environments. The phenotype can shift away from the wild phenotype via transgenerational effects, with the environment experienced by parents influencing the phenotype and fitness of offspring. There is emerging evidence that controlling transgenerational effects could help mitigate the effects of captivity, improving the success of captively bred animals post release. However, controlling transgenerational effects requires knowledge of the mechanisms driving transgenerational changes. To better understand the genetic mechanisms that contribute to transgenerational effects in captivity we investigated the heritability of behavioral phenotypes using mid parent- and single parent-offspring regressions in a population of captive-reared house mouse (Mus musculus) that we had previously shown exhibit transgenerational changes in boldness and activity behavioral types. Slopes for boldness and activity were all positive, indicating a low to moderate degree of heritability. Though, none of the heritability estimates were statistically significant due to the large surrounding errors. However, the large error surrounding the heritability estimates may also indicate that there is variability in heritability between behavioral traits within the boldness and activity behavioral types. The implication of this finding is that the potential for heritable genetic changes in captivity varies considerably between traits. We conclude that continued investigation of the potential for traits to evolve in captivity is needed to better inform captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",United States,Zoo biology,29193268,2017,What role does heritability play in transgenerational phenotypic responses to captivity?

1938,"For species at risk of decline or extinction in source-sink systems, sources are an obvious target for habitat protection actions. However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for three endangered species. Using empirically-based habitat-population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of time periods of data collection and prioritized the strongest sources for conservation. We then tested the ability of prioritized patches to identify the most habitats most affecting persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Our results indicated that conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection can impact species persistence. Shorter times series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. As source-sink metrics (i.e., births-deaths; births and immigrations - deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many non-equilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.

1940,"PURPOSE
Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+.


METHODS
Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income.


FINDINGS
In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel feature refinement MR reconstruction method from highly undersampled multichannel acquisitions for improving the image quality and preserve more detail information.


THEORY AND METHODS
The feature refinement technique, which uses a feature descriptor to pick up useful features from residual image discarded by sparsity constrains, is applied to preserve the details of the image in compressed sensing and parallel imaging in MRI (CS-pMRI). The texture descriptor and structure descriptor recognizing different types of features are required for forming the feature descriptor. Feasibility of the feature refinement was validated using three different multicoil reconstruction methods on in vivo data.


RESULTS
Experimental results show that reconstruction methods with feature refinement improve the quality of reconstructed image and restore the image details more accurately than the original methods, which is also verified by the lower values of the root mean square error and high frequency error norm.


CONCLUSION
A simple and effective way to preserve more useful detailed information in CS-pMRI is proposed. This technique can effectively improve the reconstruction quality and has superior performance in terms of detail preservation compared with the original version without feature refinement.

1942,"We reviewed the literature up to March 2016 on the effects of non-maternal voices on preterm infants' clinical outcomes. Of the 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 10 focused on short-term outcomes and one looked at long-term effects. The studies mainly showed that vocal stimuli increased preterm infants' stability in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and behavioural measures. Improvements in feeding skills were also reported. The methods and the measures used in the studies were heterogeneous, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.

1943,"Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures and abnormal electrical activity in the brain, is one of the most prevalent brain disorders. Over two million people in the United States have been diagnosed with epilepsy and 3% of the general population will be diagnosed with it at some point in their lives. While most developmental epilepsies occur due to genetic predisposition, a class of ""acquired"" epilepsies results from a variety of brain insults. A leading etiological factor for epilepsy that is currently on the rise is traumatic brain injury (TBI), which accounts for up to 20% of all symptomatic epilepsies. Remarkably, the presence of an identified early insult that constitutes a risk for development of epilepsy provides a therapeutic window in which the pathological processes associated with brain injury can be manipulated to limit the subsequent development of recurrent seizure activity and epilepsy. Recent studies have revealed diverse pathologies, including enhanced excitability, activated immune signaling, cell death, and enhanced neurogenesis within a week after injury, suggesting a period of heightened adaptive and maladaptive plasticity. An integrated understanding of these processes and their cellular and molecular underpinnings could lead to novel targets to arrest epileptogenesis after trauma. This review attempts to highlight and relate the diverse early changes after trauma and their role in development of epilepsy and suggests potential strategies to limit neurological complications in the injured brain.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193309,2017,Converging early responses to brain injury pave the road to epileptogenesis.,y
1944,"The signaling network involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not yet fully understood. This review aims to describe possible mechanisms through which the bacterial modulators may be linked directly or indirectly to the process of alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. From the late 1970s to present, new paradigm shifts have been developed regarding our understanding of pathological bone remodeling in periodontal disease. Upcoming evidence suggests that in periodontal disease the local immune response is exacerbated and involves the existence of signaling pathways that have been shown to modulate bone-cell function leading to alveolar bone loss. Those complex signaling pathways have been observed not only between bacteria but also between bacteria and the gingival surface of the host. More specifically, it has been shown that bacteria, through their secretion molecules, may interact indirectly and directly with immune-type cells of the host, resulting in the production of osteolytic agents that enhance bone resorption. Further research is required to provide a clear understanding of the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, and the availability of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis, may be useful tools in achieving this.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193310,2017,Bacterial modulators of bone remodeling in the periodontal pocket.,y
1945,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should combine individual level participant data across studies of children's responses to disasters to better understand PTSS trajectories.",United States,Journal of traumatic stress,29193316,2017,Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Trajectories Among Children After Disaster Exposure: A Review.,y

1947,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the longitudinal association of dual and single (vision and hearing) sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults.


METHODS
Two thousand eight hundred ninety adults aged 60Â years or over who participated in the longitudinal population-based TromsÃ¸ Study, Norway, were included. The impact of objective vision loss, self-report hearing loss, or dual sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety, as assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 10, was examined at baseline and 6-year follow-up using linear mixed models.


RESULTS
Hearing loss had a cross-sectional relationship with increased depression (bÂ =Â 0.1750, SEÂ =Â 0.07, PÂ =Â .02) and anxiety symptoms (bÂ =Â 0.1765, SEÂ =Â 0.08, PÂ =Â .03); however, these relationships were not significant at the 6-year follow-up. Both vision loss only and dual sensory loss predicted increased depression scores at follow-up (bÂ =Â 0.0220, SEÂ =Â 0.01, PÂ =Â .03; and bÂ =Â 0.0413, SEÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Adjustment for social isolation did not attenuate the main depression results.


CONCLUSION
Dual sensory loss resulted in increased depression symptomatology over time and posed an additional long-term risk to depression severity beyond having a single sensory loss only. Only hearing loss is associated with anxiety symptoms. Older adults with vision, hearing, and dual sensory loss have different mental health profiles. Therefore, management and intervention should be tailored to the type of sensory loss.",England,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,29193338,2017,"The association amongst visual, hearing, and dual sensory loss with depression and anxiety over 6Â years: The TromsÃ¸ Study.",y
1948,"PURPOSE
Dynamic manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) allows assessment of tissue viability by tracing manganese uptake. We aimed to develop a rapid T1 mapping method for dynamic MEMRI to facilitate assessments of murine kidney viability.


METHODS
A multi-slice saturation recovery fast spin echo (MSRFSE) was developed, validated, and subsequently applied in dynamic MEMRI at 16.4T on ischemic mouse kidneys after 4 weeks of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Baseline T1 values and post-contrast R1 (1/T1 ) changes were measured in cortex (CO), outer (OSOM), inner (ISOM) strips of outer medulla, and inner medulla (IM).


RESULTS
Validation studies showed strong agreement between MSRFSE and an established saturation recovery Look-Locker method. Baseline T1 (s) increased in the stenotic kidney CO (2.10 [1.95-2.56] vs. 1.88 [1.81-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0317) and OSOM (2.17 [2.05-2.33] vs. 1.96 [1.87-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0075) but remained unchanged in ISOM and IM. This method allowed a temporal resolution of 1.43â€‰min in dynamic MEMRI. Mn2+ uptake and retention decreased in stenotic kidneys, particularly in the OSOM (Î”R1 : 0.48 [0.38-0.56] vs. 0.64 [0.61-0.69] s-1 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).


CONCLUSION
Dynamic MEMRI by MSRFSE detected decreased cellular viability and discerned the regional responses to RAS. This technique may provide a valuable tool for noninvasive evaluation of renal viability.

1949,"PURPOSE
In typical MRI protocols, time is spent acquiring a field map to calculate the shim settings for best image quality. We propose a fast template-based field map prediction method that yields near-optimal shims without measuring the field.


METHODS
The template-based prediction method uses prior knowledge of the B0 distribution in the human brain, based on a large database of field maps acquired from different subjects, together with subject-specific structural information from a quick localizer scan. The shimming performance of using the template-based prediction is evaluated in comparison to a range of potential fast shimming methods.


RESULTS
Static B0 shimming based on predicted field maps performed almost as well as shimming based on individually measured field maps. In experimental evaluations at 7â€‰T, the proposed approach yielded a residual field standard deviation in the brain of on average 59â€‰Hz, compared with 50â€‰Hz using measured field maps and 176â€‰Hz using no subject-specific shim.


CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that shimming based on predicted field maps is feasible. The field map prediction accuracy could potentially be further improved by generating the template from a subset of subjects, based on parameters such as head rotation and body mass index.

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.


OBJECTIVES
Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.


METHODS
Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: ""tremor"", ""tremor disorders"", ""essential tremor"", ""dystonic tremor"", and ""classification"" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.


RESULTS
Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2.

1951,"BACKGROUND
Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes.


METHODS
Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite scores.


RESULTS
Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.03 units/year, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003); this difference was comparable with 8â€‰years of aging. However, being in the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal (pâ€‰=â€‰0.71) or global score (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory decline (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.01 units/year, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.002; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive function-attention decline.


CONCLUSIONS
A variable pattern of depressive symptom severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern related to decline in executive function-attention. Findings could signal differences in underlying neuropathologic processes among persons with differing depression patterns and late-life cognitive decline.

1952,"CONTEXT
Medical educators often have prior and primary experience in other academic and clinical disciplines. Individuals seeking successful careers in the education of medical students and doctors must, at some point in their development, make a conscious transition into a new identity as a medical educator. This is a necessary move if individuals are to commit to acquiring and maintaining specialist expertise in medical education. Some achieve this transition successfully, whereas others struggle and may even lose interest and abandon the endeavour. We explored senior educators' experiences of achieving the transition into medical education and their views on what helps and what hinders the process.


METHODS
In 2015 we conducted three focus groups with 15 senior medical educators. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied transition theory to guide our deductive analysis, using Schlossberg's Four S (4S) framework to code and report participants' self-reported perceptions of those factors relating to Self, Situation, Support and Strategy that had assisted them to make a successful transition to a fully acknowledged medical educator identity. Through inductive analysis, we then identified 17 explanatory sub-themes common to all three focus groups.


RESULTS
Background and circumstances, individual motivation, a sense of control, organisational support, and effective networking and information-seeking behaviour were factors identified as contributing to successful transition into, and maintenance of, a strong self-identity as a medical educator.


CONCLUSIONS
The experiences of established medical educators and, in particular, an exploration of the factors that have facilitated their transition to an acknowledged self-identity as a medical educator could assist in supporting new educators to cope with the changes involved in developing as a medical educator.",England,Medical education,29193365,2017,Making the leap to medical education: a qualitative study of medical educators' experiences.,y

To describe what and why nurses self-disclose to patients in mental health care.


BACKGROUND
Self-disclosure is common, but controversial and difficult to delineate. Extant research suggests that self-disclosure might have several potentially beneficial effects on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome for patients in mental health care, but results are often mixed and limited by definitional inconsistencies.


METHOD
Qualitative descriptive study including data from 16 nurses taking part in participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews.


RESULTS
Separate analyses resulted in four themes addressing the research question of what nurses self-disclose, and one main theme and four subthemes addressing why nurses self-disclose. The content of self-disclosure was captured in the four themes: Immediate family, Interests and activities, Life experiences, and Identity. In addition, results showed that disclosures were common among the nurses. Self-disclosure's potential to transform the nurse-patient relationship, making it more open, honest, close, reciprocal and equal, was the overarching reason why nurses shared personal information. The nurses also chose to self-disclose to share existential and everyday sentiments, to give real-life advice, because it felt natural and responsive to patients' question to do so.


CONCLUSION
Nurse self-disclosure is common and covers a variety of personal information. Nurses have several reasons for choosing to self-disclose, most of which are connected to improving the nurse-patient relationship.

To evaluate the effects of the implementation of a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings.


BACKGROUND
Care in long-term residential settings for older people is moving away from the biomedical approach and adopting a more person-centred one. Narrative can help shape the way care is planned and organised. The provision of person-centred care that is holistic and that takes account of resident's beliefs and values can be enhanced by incorporating narrative approaches to care within a practice development framework.


DESIGN
The chosen methodology was participatory action research.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2014, a methodological framework of narrative practice was implemented in two residential care settings, comprising 37 residents and 38 staff, using an action research approach. Three action cycles: (i) narrative practice and culture identification, (ii) developing narrative practice and (iii) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation.


RESULTS
Key outcomes emerged in relation to the findings. These were based on narrative being, knowing and doing and centred around the key outcomes of: (i) how people responded to change (narrative being), (ii) the development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and (iii) intentional action (narrative doing).


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a framework of narrative practice demonstrated that how people respond to change, the development of shared understandings and intentional action were interrelated and interlinked. It illustrated the importance of ensuring that practice context is taken account of in the implementation of action research and the importance of ensuring that narrative being, knowing and doing are clear and understandable for change to occur.

In England and Wales, 'approved premises' offer 24-hour staffed accommodation for high-risk offenders, most of whom are returning to the community from prison. With a move towards a standardised operating model, it is essential to be able to measure outcomes.


AIMS
Our aim is to collate and evaluate 'benchmarks' for approved premises.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to establish the impact of existing practice in all four approved premises in Wales. Data on well-being, life satisfaction, attitudes to violence and problem-solving abilities were recorded with 114 male residents (of 486), and attitudes to personality disorder and personal well-being/burnout with 30 staff (of 86), in both narrative style and according to a number of scales used within criminal justice and healthcare systems. Perceptions of environmental climate were assessed with both groups. Scores were compared with those from reference groups, including prisoners and secure hospital patients. Criminological outcomes (e.g. prison recall) were obtained for all 486 men.


RESULTS
Scores on the scales used were broadly comparable with those in relevant reference groups, but some showed floor or ceiling effects. Recall rates, whether directly from the premises or after further onward movement, were about 42% overall, comparable with those reported for similar offenders elsewhere.

1958,"The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.",England,Journal of sleep research,29193443,2017,A review of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with anxiety.,y
1959,"A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16Â years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents. Key Practitioner Message The adoption status (but not attachment representations) was found to be predictive of externalizing and total behaviour problems, suggesting that attachment itself is not the only variable to take into account in explaining possible maladaptive outcomes in late-adopted adolescents. Nevertheless, disorganized attachment positively predicted internalizing problems, being a risk factor for both adopted and nonadopted adolescents. Only for late-adopted adolescents, higher cognitive reappraisal was negatively related with externalizing problems, suggesting that the functional and positive ability to cognitively restructure negative situations may help them to reduce impulsive negative reactions towards others. Both increasing cognitive reappraisal and decreasing expressive suppression may be considered as valuable goals of therapy with adopted adolescents and their parents. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadopted peers, reported lower somatic complaints, suggesting that they may not allow themselves to show physical vulnerability as consequence of their early affective experiences of severe deprivation. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadoptedÂ ones, reported higher level of expressive suppression strategies, which may be considered as an attempt to beÂ compliant with the environment's requests in order to be loved, accepted, and nurtured.",England,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,29193445,2017,Late-adoptions in adolescence: Can attachment and emotion regulation influence behaviour problems?

The sample comprised 3770 consecutive patients with a mean age of 49.1Â years; 69.7% were male. OSA was diagnosed and categorized based on a standard respiratory polygraphic sleep study using a type 3 portable monitor. Patients completed the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) prior to the sleep study. In addition, they answered questions about whether they were currently in treatment for mental disorders and whether they had been diagnosed previously with depression.

1961,"BACKGROUND
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence following gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recently, more and more attentions are being focused on gut microbiota in brain and behavior. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is considered as a mediator that links the gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Clostridium butyricum (Cb) on brain damage in a mouse model of TBI.


METHODS
Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a model of TBI-induced by weight-drop impact head injury and were treated intragastrically with Cb.Â The cognitive deficits, brain water content, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) in the brain were also measured.Â Moreover, the intestinal barrier permeability, the expression of TJ protein and GLP-1, and IL-6 level in the intestine were detected.


RESULTS
Cb treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, brain edema, neurodegeneration, and BBB impairment. Meanwhile, Cb treatment also significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins (occludin and zonula occluden-1), p-Akt and Bcl-2, but decreased expression of Bax. Moreover, Cb treatment exhibited more prominent effects on decreasing the levels of plasma d-lactate and colonic IL-6, upregulating expression of Occludin, and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, Cb-treatedÂ mice showed increased the secretion of intestinal GLP-1 and upregulated expression of cerebral GLP-1R.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Cb in TBI mice and the involved mechanisms were partially attributed to the elevating GLP-1 secretion through the gut-brain axis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193450,2017,Clostridium butyricum exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury via the gut-brain axis.,y

We observed an upregulation of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) in the MÃ¼ller glia of damaged retinas where the formation of MGPCs is known to occur. Activation of RA-signaling was stimulated, whereas inhibition suppressed the proliferation of MGPCs in damaged retinas and in fibroblast growth factor 2-treated undamaged retinas. Furthermore, inhibition of RA-degradation stimulated the proliferation of MGPCs. Levels of Pax6, Klf4, and cFos were upregulated in MGPCs by RA agonists and downregulated in MGPCs by RA antagonists. Activation of RA-signaling following MGPC proliferation increased the percentage of progeny that differentiated as neurons. Similarly, the combination of RA and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) significantly increased neurogenesis from retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ). In summary, RA-signaling stimulates the formation of proliferating MGPCs and enhances the neurogenic potential of MGPCs and stem cells in the CMZ.

1963,"OBJECTIVE
Validate the Parkinson's disease (PD) composite scale (PDCS).


METHODS
The study included One hundred ninety four PD patients in five countries. Investigators completed the following scales: PDCS, MDS-UPDRS, PDSS-2, MoCA, WOK-19, SEND-PD and CISI-PD. For test-retest analysis, a second administration of the PDCS was carried out in 61 stable patients (as per the CISI-PD) in 7 to 14 days after the first evaluation. The PDCS is a novel scale for PD with a total of 17 items divided in 4 domains: motor, non-motor, treatment complication and disability.


RESULTS
PDCS mean and median values were close. Skewness values were into the criterion limits (-1 to +1). The complete range of scores was covered for 14 of the 17 items (83.4%). Floor effect of 25.26% and 28.25% were observed in the Complication and Disability level dimensions due to the proportion of patients free of these difficulties. No relevant floor or ceiling effect was observed for the PDCS Total Score (1.03% and 0.52%, respectively). The stability of the scale appeared excellent with most items meeting weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.80. The convergent validity of the PDCS with corresponding scores of the MDS-UPDRS showed high correlation values (rS â‰¥0.60). The internal validity was into acceptable limits, with the majority of values higher than the minimal 0.30 threshold. The standard error of measurement suggested a satisfactory precision (SEM=3.81, <30% of the PDCS total score standard deviation).


CONCLUSION
The PDCS appears to be a feasible, acceptable, reproducible and valid scale. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",England,European journal of neurology,29193455,2017,The Parkinson's Disease Composite Scale: Results of the first validation study.,y
1964,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. The phenotypic expression of the disease may, in part, relate to alterations in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. This resting-state study sought to clarify this in DLB, how networks differed from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether they were related to clinical symptoms in DLB. Resting-state networks were estimated using independent component analysis. We investigated functional connectivity changes in 31 DLB patients compared to 31 healthy controls and a disease comparator group of 29 AD patients using dual regression and FSLNets. Within-network connectivity was generally decreased in DLB compared to controls, mainly in motor, temporal, and frontal networks. Between-network connectivity was mainly intact; only the connection between a frontal and a temporal network showed increased connectivity in DLB. Differences between AD and DLB were subtle and we did not find any significant correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms in DLB. This study emphasizes the importance of reduced connectivity within motor, frontal, and temporal networks in DLB with relative sparing of the default mode network. The lack of significant correlations between connectivity measures and clinical scores indicates that the observed reduced connectivity within these networks might be related to the presence, but not to the severity of motor and cognitive impairment in DLB patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that AD and DLB may show more similarities than differences in patients with mild disease.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193464,2017,Functional connectivity in dementia with Lewy bodies: A within- and between-network analysis.,y
1965,"How does social information affect the perception of taste early in life? Does mere knowledge of other people's food preferences impact children's own experience when eating? In Experiment 1, 5- and 6-year-old children consumed more of a food described as popular with other children than a food that was described as unpopular with other children, even though the two foods were identical. In Experiment 2, children ate more of a food described as popular with children than a food described as popular with adults. Experiment 3 tested whether different perceptual experiences of otherwise identical foods contributed to the mechanisms underlying children's consumption. After sampling both endpoints of a sweet-to-sour range (applesauce with 0 mL or 5mL of lemon juice added), children were asked to taste and categorize applesauce samples with varying amounts of lemon juice added. When classifying ambiguous samples that were near the midpoint of the range (2 mL and 3 mL), children were more likely to categorize popular foods as sweet as compared to unpopular foods. Together, these findings provide evidence that social information plays a powerful role in guiding children's consumption and perception of foods.

To investigate the feasibility of a 13-week mentoring program in providing social support to promote hope for recovery in anorexia nervosa.


BACKGROUND
With no clear first line psychological treatment for people with anorexia nervosa, mentoring support programs, as an adjunct to treatment, may provide the social support necessary to promote hope for recovery.


DESIGN
A mixed method study; Participatory action research.


METHODS
Women (n=11), recovering and who had recovered from anorexia nervosa, participated in the program and completed self-report questionnaires related to quality of life, distress and the mentoring relationship at different time points. Qualitative feedback from logbooks, workshop evaluation questionnaires, interviews and focus groups was also collected to assess the program's acceptability.


RESULTS
General compliance for completing most study outcome questionnaires was 90% however the mentoring relationship questionnaires were not completed to the same degree. Five key themes emerged from the focus group/interview data: 1) She understands me and could relate to me; 2) Re-connecting with the world - Asking questions and being challenged; 3) Mentors' altruistic motivations and the transformation and discovery of self; 4) Instilling hope - Recovery is possible; and 5) Effective communication - The key to successful mentoring.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is needed however the results provide preliminary support for the mentoring program's feasibility as an adjunct to treatment. We found that having someone who understands, to talk and share with, met a clear need for people with anorexia nervosa.

1967,"Stroke patients with motor deficits typically feature enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, also healthy subjects may show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with higher motor demands. Therefore, the question arises to what extent stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural reorganization. We here investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1) but unlike in healthy controls also in contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of right SPL onto affected/left M1 in patients but not in controls when moving the affected/right hand independent of the movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of right SPL was positively coupled with the ""active"" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency. In summary, these findings are compatible with a supportive role of right SPL with respect to motor function of the paretic hand in the reorganized brain.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193484,2017,Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients.,y

In the era of neurological subspecialization, most neurologists will have a field of specialist interest. The aim of this cross-sectional multi-national study was to identify the key areas of interest among trainees or junior specialists, assess the potential influence of an interest in research, and consider the results in light of population needs.


METHODS
A total of 300 residents and junior neurologists who received a bursary to attend the European Academy of Neurology conference were invited to participate in this study. Demographic and work-related characteristics, as well as main subspecialty of choice were examined via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Participants holding a higher degree (PhD/MD) or working in research posts were considered research oriented.


RESULTS
In total, 191 Neurologists in training or junior specialists responded (response rate 63.7%). Full data were available for 187 participants (59.4% females). The study sample had a mean age of 30.5Â±3.4 years (range 25 - 45). The most popular subspecialty was movement disorders (18.2%), followed by multiple sclerosis (11.2%) and epilepsy (10.2%). This did not differ significantly between the participants who were or were not research-oriented.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a potential mismatch between the interests of trainees, and the future needs of the populations they serve, which it is important to identify for workforce planning.

1970,"OBJECTIVES
No studies have focused on socioeconomic disparities in obesity within and between cohorts. Our objectives were to examine income gradients in obesity between birth-cohorts (inter-cohort variations) and within each birth-cohort (intra-cohort variations) by gender and race/ethnicity.


METHODS
Our sample includes 56,820 white and black adults from pooled, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1971-2012). We fit a series of logistic hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models to control for the effects of age and period, simultaneously. Predicted probabilities of obesity by poverty-to-income ratio were estimated and graphed for 5-year cohort groups from 1901-1990. We also stratified this relationship for four gender and racial/ethnic subgroups.


RESULTS
Obesity disparities due to income were weaker for post-World War I and II generations, specifically the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s to 1950s cohorts, than for other cohorts. In contrast, we found greater income gradients in obesity among cohorts from the 1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to 1970s. Moreover, obesity disparities due to income across cohorts vary markedly by gender and race/ethnicity. White women with higher income consistently exhibited a lower likelihood of obesity than those with lower income since early 1900s cohorts; whereas, black men with higher income exhibited higher risks of obesity than those with lower income in most cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that strategies that address race and/or gender inequalities in obesity should be cognizant of significant historical factors that may be unique to cohorts. Period-based approaches that ignore life-course experiences captured in significant cohort-based experiences may limit the utility of policies and interventions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193504,2017,Cohort-based income gradients in obesity among U.S. adults.,y

This study proposed and tested a structural model to explain and predict family empowerment in families of children with special needs.


BACKGROUND
Family empowerment of families of children with special needs can be explained using the Double ABCX model. Although constant stressors such as parenting stress and family demands can have negative effects on family empowerment, family resources and parenting efficacy can mediate the negative effect through effective coping strategies.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional research design was employed.


METHODS
A survey was conducted with 240 parents of children with special needs. Upon exclusion of 4 responses deemed inadequate to the statistics process, 236 responses were selected for the analysis. Based on the items used in the previous research, we used the scale of family demands 38, the scale of parenting stress 24, the scale of parenting efficacy 37, the scale of pattern of organization 30, the scale of communication process 16, and the scale of family empowerment 32.


RESULTS
In families of children with special needs, parenting stress had a negative effect on parenting efficacy and family resources, namely, pattern of organization and communication process. Family needs had a positive effect on parenting efficacy. Parenting stress and family demands influenced family empowerment through parenting efficacy and family resources (pattern of organization and communication process), while parenting efficacy contributed to family empowerment.


CONCLUSIONS
This study empirically analyzed the usefulness of the Double ABCX model in predicting family empowerment. Family resource factors (organization pattern and communication process) and perception or judgement factors (such as parenting efficacy) were found to mediate the negative impact of various stressors experienced by families of children with special needs.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study findings suggest that clinical practice and management should focus on providing efficient intervention methods to lower stress in families of children with special needs. Reinforcing factors contributing to family empowerment, such as parenting efficacy, organization pattern, and communication process will alleviate families' stress, resulting in a positive educational and developmental impact on children with special needs.

1972,"Neurogenesis encompasses an entire set of events that leads to the generation of newborn neurons from neural stem cells and more committed progenitor cells, including cell division, the production of migratory precursors and their progeny, differentiation and integration into circuits. In particular, the precise control of neuronal migration and morphological changes is essential for the development of the neocortex. Postmitotic cells within the intermediate zone have been found to transiently assume a characteristic ""multipolar"" morphology, after which a multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs before the cells enter the cortical plate; however, the importance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical cytoarchitecture and the precise genetic control of this phase remains largely unknown. Thus, this review article focuses on the multipolar phase in the developing neocortex. It begins by summarizing the molecular mechanism that underlies multipolar migration for the regulation of each step in multipolar phase in intermediate zone. The physiological significance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical lamination and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with migration defects is then described.",England,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,29193520,2017,Physiological significance of multipolar cells generated from neural stem cells and progenitors for the establishment of neocortical cytoarchitecture.,y

To analyze whether living conditions, experienced by mothers and adult daughters during their childhood, are associated with age at menarche (AAM) in daughters.


METHODS
From September, 2011, to January, 2014, AAM and childhood living conditions were collected from a sample of 246 dyads of Maya mothers (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰59.60 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.64) and their adult daughters (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰33.03 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰5.57) from the cities of Merida and Motul in Yucatan, Mexico. Indicators of childhood living conditions were number of siblings and quality of house construction materials in both generations, and father's absence among daughters in their pre-menarcheal years. Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between childhood conditions in mother-daughter dyads and daughter's AAM.


RESULTS
The recalled mean AAM of adult Maya daughters was 12.05 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.53). After adjusting for the influence of mothers' AAM, number of siblings in both the mothers' and daughters' families directly predicted daughters' AAM (more siblings was associated with a later AAM); and a higher (better) index of household conditions in mothers' childhood was associated with earlier AAM in daughters. The household conditions index during the childhood of daughters and father's absence were not associated with their AAM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that better living conditions experienced by the mothers and daughters during their childhood may lower mean AAM in daughters in the context of populations that show important intergenerational changes in their social and economic conditions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193533,2017,"Living conditions and change in age of menarche in adult Maya mothers and daughters from Yucatan, Mexico.",y
1974,"Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, 'boom-and-bust' demography, hybridization, and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure, and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation, and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C. santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C. santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker, and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses' perspectives of language barriers and their impact on the provision of care to patients with limited English proficiency from diverse linguistic background.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Using individual interviews and focus group discussions, data were collected from 59 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals in England. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.


FINDINGS
Three themes: 'multi-ethnicities and language barriers'; 'the impact of language barriers'; and 'communicating via interpreters', were identified. Communication was identified as the most important aspect of care provision and an essential component of a nurse's professional role regardless of the clinical area or speciality. Language barriers were identified as the biggest obstacles in providing adequate, appropriate, effective and timely care to patients with limited English proficiency. Use of professional interpreters was considered useful; however, the limitations associated with use of interpretation service, including arrangement difficulties, availability and accessibility of interpreters, convenience, confidentiality and privacy related issues and impact on the patient's comfort were mentioned.


CONCLUSION
Language barriers, in any country or setting, can negatively affect nurses' ability to communicate effectively with their patients and thereby have a negative impact on the provision of appropriate, timely, safe and effective care to meet patient's needs.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
An understanding of language barriers can help nurses find appropriate strategies to overcome such barriers and, consequently, enhance the provision of effective care to patients affected by language barriers in any clinical setting in any health care system. The findings of the study has international relevance as language barriers affect health care provision in any country or setting. This article is protected by copyright.

This study reports on the committee's ability to achieve these goals.


PROCEDURE
An online survey was sent to YIs who were registered with the program from 2004 to2015, assessing three major domains: (1) overall experience with the mentor pairing, (2) satisfaction with the program, and (3) academic accomplishments of the mentees.


RESULTS
The response rate was 64% (110/171). Overall, YIs rated the success of their mentorship pairing as 7.2 out of 10 (median) (25th, 75th quartile 3.6, 9.6). The direct effects of the mentorship program included 70% YIs reporting a positive effect on their career, 40% reporting any grant or manuscript resulting from the pairing, 47% forming a new research collaboration, and 43% receiving appointment to a COG committee. Respondents reported success in COG with 38% authoring a manuscript on behalf of COG and 65% reporting a leadership position including seven current or past COG discipline chairs and 20 study chairs.

A method of real-time, accurate probe tracking at the entrance of the MRI bore is developed, which, fused with pre-procedural MR images, will enable clinicians to perform cryoablation efficiently in a large workspace with image guidance.


METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) tracking coupled with optical tracking is used to track the probe. EM tracking is achieved with an MRI-safe EM sensor working under the scanner's magnetic field to compensate the line-of-sight issue of optical tracking. Unscented Kalman filter-based probe tracking is developed to smooth the EM sensor measurements when occlusion occurs and to improve the tracking accuracy by fusing the measurements of two sensors.


RESULTS
Experiments with a spine phantom show that the mean targeting errors using the EM sensor alone and using the proposed method are 2.21Â mm and 1.80Â mm, respectively.

To describe sleep patterns in young children with epilepsy and to examine levels of agreement between measurements derived from actigraphy and diary recordings.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHODS
Eighty-nine toddlers and preschool-aged children with epilepsy wore an actigraph on their wrists for 7 consecutive days. Parents and caregivers maintained a concurrent sleep diary while the child was wearing the monitor. Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends.


FINDINGS
Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were Â±35, Â±15, Â±82, Â±70, and Â±29 min, respectively. Differences between actigraphy and diary-derived sleep variables were consistently greater for weekends than for weekdays. Discrepancies between actigraphy and diary-derived actual sleep at night were significantly greater for children who slept alone than for those who co-slept with a parent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates an acceptable agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings for sleep onset, sleep offset, and daytime sleep, but insufficient agreement for actual sleep at night and wake after sleep onset, with parents of children sleeping alone more likely to misestimate child sleep behaviors. Deviation of weekend sleep from weekdays further decreased the accuracy of parental sleep estimates and increased the discrepancies between actigraphy and diary.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on brain magnetic resonance imaging, represent an abnormality related to the development of geriatric syndromes. Recently, it has been found that low sympathetic nervous activity might be associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the severity of cerebral WMH and sympathetic nervous activity, measured by the heart rate variability.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 39 older patients. Holter recording was carried out for 30 min. From the RR intervals on the electrocardiogram, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals, the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in all the five segments of the entire recording, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF were calculated. In regard to the WMH, periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The WMH were also rated semiquantitatively according to the methods developed by Junque (periventricular hyperintensities) and de Groot (DWMH).


RESULTS
The LF/HF showed significant negative correlations with the total and regional periventricular hyperintensities, as well as DWMH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the negative associations remained significant between the LF/HF and DWMH (total, temporal, occipital). Furthermore, fall risk index significantly correlated with the LF/HF, total and the occipital DWMH.


CONCLUSIONS
The severity of the DWMH was associated with the LF/HF and the fall risk, one of the important geriatric syndromes, suggesting that WMH, sympathetic nervous dysfunction and geriatric syndrome are interrelated to each other.

Results showed that 43% of participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 42% lived in poverty, and 20% had fair or poor health; yet, 60% were hopeful about returning to Palestine. Participants who had better perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness were less likely to have symptoms of major depression. Perceived health was the only factor-not gender, poverty, or right-of-return hopefulness-that explained the variance in depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Palestinian adult refugees in Jordan exhibited symptoms of major depression that were associated with poorer perceived health and less hopefulness about repatriation to Palestine.

1984,"In this paper, we propose that mental health nursing has become a zombie category, at least in the Australian context. Mental health nursing is a concept that has lost any real explanatory or conceptual power, yet nevertheless persists in public discourse and the collective imagination. In recent decades, powerful forces have contributed to the zombification of the mental health nursing workforce and the academy. An increase in medical hegemony, the ascendancy of allied health in mental health service provision, the need for uncritical and servile workers, protocol-driven work practices, and a failure of leadership to mobilize any substantial resistance to these trends have enabled the infection to spread. The recognition of zombification, active resistance against the forces that conspire to cause it, and the cultivation of genuine conscientious critical thought and debate offer the only hope of survival of mental health nursing as a thriving specialty.",Australia,International journal of mental health nursing,29193640,2017,"Rise of the zombie institution, the failure of mental health nursing leadership, and mental health nursing as a zombie category.",y

Many older adults face limitations to participating in active leisure activities as a result of their physical constraints from aging. Passive leisure activities become alternative leisure activities for older adults as a result of limited physical capacity. The present study sought to determine whether there exists a difference in the frequency of participation in passive and active leisure activities, and the effect of participation in passive and active leisure activities on the life satisfaction level of old adults.


METHODS
A total of 460 participants aged 60-95â€‰years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index - Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities.


RESULTS
The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), homemaking/maintenance (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and traveling (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index - Z for older adults.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates. The current study suggests marketing and programming plans to overcome the constraints that influence older adults' life satisfaction.

1986,"Recent studies have used results on SNP association with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to create polygenic risk scores (PRS) discriminating non-familial unrelated patients from controls. Little is known about the role of PRS in densely affected multigenerational families. We tested PRS differences between affected SZ and BD family members from their non-affected adult relatives (NAARs) in Eastern Quebec Kindreds and from controls. We examined 1227 subjects: from 17 SZ and BD kindreds, we studied 153 patients (57 SZ, 13 schizoaffective, and 83 BD) and 180 NAARs, and 894 unrelated controls from the Eastern Quebec population. PRS were derived from published case-control association studies of SZ and BD. We also constructed a combined SZ and BD PRS by using SNPs from both SZ and BD PRS. SZ patients had higher SZ PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0039, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027) and BD patients had higher BD PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027). Differences between affected subjects and NAARs and controls were significant with both SZ and BD PRS.

Dietary cholesterol has been shown to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed that oxysterol especially 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) may play a potential role in Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) production and accumulation during AD progression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To investigate the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol and 27-OHC on learning and memory impairment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with cholesterol diet with or without 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole) injection. We determined the levels of cholesterol, 27-OHC, 24S-OHC, 7Î±-OHC and 7Î²-OHC in plasma; ApoA, ApoB, HDL-C and LDL-C in plasma or brain; CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in liver and CYP46A1 and CYP7B1 in brain; cathepsin B, cathepsin D and acid phosphatase in lysosome; AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 in brain. Results showed increased levels of 27-OHC (PÂ <Â 0.01), LDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.01), ApoB (PÂ <Â 0.01) and decreased level of HDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.05) in plasma, upregulated CYP27A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) and CYP7A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) expression in liver, altered lysosomal function and increased level of AÎ² in brain (PÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
This study indicated that the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol on learning and memory impairment may be involved in cholesterol metabolism and lysosome function with the increase of plasma 27-OHC, thus resulting in AÎ² formation and accumulation.

1988,"Recent studies showed cultural worldviews are a key determinant of environmental risk perceptions; thus, they could influence climate change adaptation strategies. African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45 % of agro-pastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a compliment to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation.

Strengthening neighborhood social networks is important for promoting health among older adults. However, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing older adults' social networks have not yet been established. The present study examined whether a university-led community intervention that provided communication opportunities could increase older Japanese adults' neighborhood social networks.


METHODS
The present study used a quasi-experimental design. Before the intervention, using postal mail, we carried out a baseline questionnaire survey that was sent to all people living in the Tsurukabuto community aged â‰¥60â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰1769), of whom 1068 responded. For the community intervention, 18 event-based programs were provided over the course of 1â€‰year at Kobe University. Academic staff at Kobe University organized all the programs. During the program, social interactions among participants were promoted. A follow-up survey was distributed to those who responded to the baseline survey, and 710 individuals answered the question about their participation in the intervention programs (138 respondents were participants, 572 were non-participants). The neighborhood social network was measured in both the baseline and follow-up surveys.


RESULTS
Analysis of covariance showed that the changes in neighborhood social network among participants in the program was significantly higher than the changes among non-participants (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046) after adjusting for the baseline score of social network.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study found that participants of the intervention expanded their neighborhood social network, but non-participants did not.

1990,"Neural crest cells (NCC) can migrate into different parts of the body and express their strong inductive potential. In addition, they are multipotent and are able to differentiate into various cell types with diverse functions. In the primitive gut, NCC induce differentiation of muscular structures and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and they themselves differentiate into the elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), neurons and glial cells. ICC develop by way of mesenchymal cell differentiation in the outer parts of the primitive gut wall around the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia, with the exception of colon, where they appear simultaneously also at the submucosal border of the circular muscular layer around the submucosal plexus (SMP) ganglia. However, in a complex process of reciprocal induction of NCC and local mesenchyma, c-kit positive precursors are the first to differentiate, representing probably the common precursors of ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). C-kit positive precursors could represent a key impact factor regarding the final differentiation of NCC into neurons and glial cells with neurons subsequently excreting stem cell factor (SCF) and other signalling molecules. Under the impact of SCF, a portion of c-kit positive precursors lying immediately around the ganglia differentiate into ICC, while the rest differentiate into SMC.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193736,2017,Development of interstitial cells of Cajal in the human digestive tract as the result of reciprocal induction of mesenchymal and neural crest cells.,y
1991,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A.

1992,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multi-arm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of LGMs, how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model in order to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network. A publicly available R package, nmaINLA, is developed to automate the INLA implementation of NMA models which are considered in this paper. Three applications illustrate the use of INLA for a NMA.",England,Research synthesis methods,29193801,2017,A design-by-treatment interaction model for network meta-analysis and meta-regression with integrated nested Laplace approximations.,y
1993,"Social communication impairments are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and this class of symptoms is a target for treatments for the disorder. Measures of social attention, assessed via eye-gaze tracking (EGT), have been proposed as an early efficacy biomarker for clinical trials targeting social communication skills. EGT measures have been shown to differentiate children with ASD from typical children; however, there is less known about their relationships with social communication outcome measures that are typically used in ASD clinical trials. In the present study, an EGT task involving viewing a videotape of an actor making bids for a child's attention was evaluated in 25 children with ASD aged 24-72 months. Children's attention to the actor during the dyadic bid condition measured via EGT was found to be strongly associated with five well-validated caregiver-reported outcome measures that are commonly used to assess social communication in clinical trials. These results highlight the convergent validity of EGT measures of social attention in relation to caregiver-reported clinical measures. EGT holds promise as a non-invasive, quantitative, and objective biomarker that is associated with social communication abilities in children with ASD. Autism Res 2017,.

1994,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in which reduced social interest is a common symptom, such as autism, depression, and anxiety, are frequently associated with genetic mutations affecting GABAergic transmission. Benzodiazepine treatment, acting via GABAA receptors, improves social interaction in male mouse models with autism-like features. The protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) can act as an endogenous benzodiazepine, but a role for DBI in social behavior has not been described. Here we investigated the role of DBI in the social interest and recognition behavior of mice. The responses of DBI wild-type and knockout male and female mice to ovariectomized female wild-type mice (a neutral social stimulus) were evaluated in a habituation/dishabituation task. Both male and female knockout mice exhibited reduced social interest, and DBI knockout mice lacked the sex difference in social interest levels observed in wild-type mice, in which males showed higher social interest levels than females. The ability to discriminate between familiar and novel stimulus mice (social recognition) was not impaired in DBI-deficient mice of either sex. DBI knockouts could learn a rotarod motor task, and could discriminate between social and non-social odors. Both sexes of DBI knockout mice showed increased repetitive grooming behavior, but not in a manner that would account for the decrease in social investigation time. Genetic loss of DBI did not alter seminal vesicle weight, indicating that the social interest phenotype of males lacking DBI is not due to reduced circulating testosterone. Together, these studies reveal a novel role of DBI in driving social interest and motivation.",England,"Genes, brain, and behavior",29193847,2017,Genetic loss of diazepam binding inhibitor in mice impairs social interest.,y

1996,"Currently, the predominant hypothesis explains cellular differentiation and behaviour as an essentially genetically driven intracellular process, suggesting a gene-centrism paradigm. However, although many living species genetic has now been described, there is still a large gap between the genetic information interpretation and cell behaviour prediction. Indeed, the physical mechanisms underlying the cell differentiation and proliferation, which are now known or suspected to guide such as the flow of energy through cells and tissues, have been often overlooked. We thus here propose a complementary conceptual framework towards the development of an energy-oriented classification of cell properties, that is, a mitochondria-centrism hypothesis based on physical forces-driven principles. A literature review on the physical-biological interactions in a number of various biological processes is analysed from the point of view of the fluid and solid mechanics, electricity and thermodynamics. There is consistent evidence that physical forces control cell proliferation and differentiation. We propose that physical forces interfere with the cell metabolism mostly at the level of the mitochondria, which in turn control gene expression.

1998,"Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date there are limited options for treating this core symptomology. Treatments that stimulate adenosine A2A receptors may represent a promising approach for reducing RRBs in ASD. This is because A2A receptors are expressed on striatal neurons of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Under activation of this pathway has been associated with RRBs while activation of A2A receptors leads to increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway. The present studies investigated whether acute, systemic treatment with CGS21680, an A2A receptor agonist attenuates elevated self-grooming and a probabilistic reversal learning deficit in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf /J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism. The effects of this treatment were also investigated in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as a comparison strain. Using a spatial reversal learning test with 80/20 probabilistic feedback, comparable to one in which ASD individuals exhibit deficits, CGS 21680 (0.005 and 0.01mg/kg) attenuated a reversal learning deficit in BTBR mice. Enhancement in probabilistic reversal learning performance resulted from CGS 21680 improving the consistent maintenance of new adaptive behavioral choice patterns after reversal. CGS 21680 at 0.01 mg, but not 0.005 mg, also reduced self-grooming behavior in BTBR mice. CGS 21680 did not affect self-grooming or reversal learning in B6 mice.

1999,"OBJECTIVE
A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment. The authors have developed software through which students can experience the practice of psychiatry (in particular, with dementia patients) in its entirety. This study compares this software with conventional learning methods.


METHOD
The control group was 43 fifth-year medical students in 2014 who studied using a conventional learning method (taking lectures and being in contact with actual patients). The experimental group was 36 fifth-year medical students in 2015 that used computer software (taking lectures and with reduced time in contact with actual patients). The authors compared the two groups. Each group was tested before and after clinical training on their acquisition of knowledge of dementia. The control group was tested in 2014, and the experimental group was tested in 2015.


RESULTS
The difference in average test scores between the two groups was statistically significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), with the experimental group scoring higher.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that students who were taught using a computer-based software method were better able to answer a standard series of questions designed to evaluate their understanding of dementia than those who were taught in a conventional manner.

However it now seems necessary to question this perception of humanity and the human condition.Indeed, longer life expectancy together with its related pathologies and medical progress lead us to think differently. Today we realise that those qualities which were thought to belong specifically to human beings, such as awareness, reason, memory and free will, can disappear. Should we conclude then that those whose capacities have decreased or disappeared have become less human or have even lost all human qualities?Such questioning leads to new ways of describing humans whereby they would be defined not in substantial but rather in interpersonal terms.Surely being a person means first and foremost that we live through and for others.

Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰23) were observed while playing a digital bowling game presented on Xbox Kinect one hour per week for a period of 20 weeks, to capture naturalistic data. Field notes generated through observations were transcribed and analysed to identify emerging themes. The findings revealed three predominant themes which illustrate the potential of motion-based technology as a group activity for people with dementia who attend adult day programmes: (a) the importance of having a trained trainer, (b) learning versus mastery and (c) playing 'independently together'. People with dementia can learn to play games presented on motion-based technology and enjoy doing so. Furthermore, using the technology in a group setting fostered an encouraging and supportive environment which further contributed to the leisure experience. However, to be used most effectively, staff must be trained to set-up and interact with the technology, as well as introduce, teach and support people with dementia to use it.",England,"Dementia (London, England)",29192511,2017,The Kinect Project: Group motion-based gaming for people living with dementia.,y
2007,"Background Apathy is prominent in persons with dementia and apathy assessment is challenging. It remains unclear who should conduct apathy assessments in long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). Methods This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant, and one licensed practical nurse or activity staff. Family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff rated the resident's apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results The results revealed that ratings conducted by certified nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (râ€‰=â€‰0.47, pâ€‰=â€‰.08). None of the other AES ratings among family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were significantly correlated. Discussion Family and clinical caregivers were incongruent on their AES ratings of apathy. It remains undetermined which rater provides the most valid AES rating for residents with dementia. Findings from this study further highlight challenges in rating apathy in this population.

2008,"The acute hospital admission of patients with dementia is associated with poor outcome and higher costs. Much of our knowledge on how hospital stays are experienced by patients and staff is generated from short and fragmented data collections, in which the significance of knowledge about day-to-day care might be overlooked, and might partly explain why the poor outcome for this group of patients is not fully understood. This study used participant observation to follow patients with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards after fall incidents. To gather longitudinal data, patients were followed during day and evening shifts, from admission to discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The data showed that, despite having little specific knowledge about dementia care, staff were able to gather information about the patient's needs and wishes relevant to administrating medicine in a person-centred way. However, much of this valuable information was lost between shifts or became hidden among the overwhelming amount of information in electronic patient records. As a consequence, much of the knowledge about individual patients' needs and wishes had to be collected all over again at every shift. The study concludes that careful handover of information on person-centred dementia care can play an important role in making hospital stays more dementia-friendly.",England,"Dementia (London, England)",29192513,2017,Medication and care in Alzheimer's patients in the acute care setting: A qualitative analysis.,y

To analyze the impact of measures undertaken to control brucellosis in the Republic of Macedonia on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the disease in humans.


METHODS
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients with brucellosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated at the University Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje during three time periods: 1989-1990 when no national strategy for disease control existed, 2000-2001 when some activities for control were performed and 2011-2014 when an organized and financially supported strategy was accomplished.


RESULTS
A drastic decrease of the number of cases of human brucellosis during the last period when compared to the first two ones (3.9 and 3.3 times lower, respectively) was evident. Patients from the third period were significantly older, with median age 41 years (range 4-73) vs. 31 years (3-77) and 34 years (1-74), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰.013). There were more males (86.6 vs. 73.6% and 63.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and the disease was more often acquired professionally (80.6 vs. 60.1% and 59.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.006). Fewer patients from the third period had elevated body temperature either as a symptom (50.7 vs. 73.6% and 69.6%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.003), or as a sign (35.8 vs. 55.4% and 56.8%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.011) and less often exhibited focal forms (40.3 vs. 56.8% and 64.0%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.007).

2014,"BACKGROUND
Patients with brain lesions and resultant chronic aphasia frequently suffer from depression. However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial).


METHODS
In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test).


RESULTS
Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192534,2017,Intensive Communicative Therapy Reduces Symptoms of Depression in Chronic Nonfluent Aphasia.,y
2015,"BACKGROUND
Patients with neglect ignore or respond slower to contralesional stimuli. Neglect negatively influences independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most frequently studied treatments, yet there is little evidence regarding positive effects on neglect behavior in ADL.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether PA in the subacute phase ameliorates neglect in situations of varying complexity.


METHODS
A total of 70 neglect patients admitted for inpatient stroke rehabilitation received either PA or sham adaptation (SA) for 2 weeks, with full access to standard treatment. There were 7 time-dependent measurements (baseline and 1-4, 6, and 14 weeks after start of treatment). The primary outcome was change of neglect as observed during basic ADL with the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in performance on a dynamic multitask (ie, the Mobility Assessment Course [MAC]) and a static paper-and-pencil task (ie, a shape cancellation task [SC]).


RESULTS
In all, 34 patients received PA and 35 SA. There were significant time-dependent improvements in performance as measured with the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F > 15.57; P < .001). There was no significant difference in magnitude of improvement between groups on the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F < 2.54; P > .113].


CONCLUSIONS
No beneficial effects of PA over SA in the subacute phase poststroke were observed, which was comparable for situations of varying complexity. Heterogeneity of the syndrome, time post-stroke onset, and the content of treatment as usual are discussed. Basic knowledge on subtypes and recovery patterns would aid the development of tailored treatment.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192535,2017,Prism Adaptation in Rehabilitation?

To examine changes in breastfeeding rates in 0 to 6 month old infants in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, over the period from 2009 to 2015, for the total population as well as for various ethnic groups.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHOD
Breastfeeding rates were examined for the period from 2009 to 2015 in 165,420 registrations of 75,543 infants at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for the entire Amsterdam population and for various ethnic groups. Differences were analysed using Ï‡2 tests.


RESULTS
The weighted percentage of total breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding as well as a combination of breast and formula feeding) increased in the entire Amsterdam study population over the period from 2009 to 2015 (2 weeks: 87.8% to 89.1%; 3 months: 61.6% to 63.6%; 6 months: 39.5% to 42.2%). Increases were mainly the result of increases in weighted percentages for exclusive breastfeeding. The highest exclusive breastfeeding rates were observed among the Turkish ethnic group, the lowest among the Antillean/Aruban and Surinamese groups.


CONCLUSION
Percentages for total breastfeeding as well as exclusive breastfeeding in Amsterdam rose over the period from 2009 to 2015, but there is room for improvement.

2023,"Diurnal preference (e.g., being an owl or lark) has been associated with several psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder (BP), major depressive disorder, and substance use disorders. Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic influences on diurnal preference have exclusively included subjects of European ancestry. This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs. Genetic risk score (GRS) profiling detected shared genetic risk between evening preference and related disorders. Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012.

2024,"OBJECTIVE
Regenerated peripheral nervous tissue possesses different morphometric properties compared to undisrupted nerve. It is poorly understood how these morphometric differences alter the response of the regenerated nerve to electrical stimulation. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the electrophysiological response of regenerated and undisrupted nerve axons to electrical stimulation delivered by macro-sieve electrodes (MSEs).


APPROACH
A 3D finite element model of a peripheral nerve segment populated with mammalian myelinated axons and implanted with a macro-sieve electrode has been developed. Fiber diameters and morphometric characteristics representative of undisrupted or regenerated peripheral nervous tissue were assigned to core conductor models to simulate the two tissue types. Simulations were carried out to quantify differences in thresholds and chronaxie between undisrupted and regenerated fiber populations. The model was also used to determine the influence of axonal caliber on recruitment thresholds for the two tissue types. Model accuracy was assessed through comparisons with in-vivo recruitment data from chronically implanted MSEs.


MAIN RESULTS
Recruitment thresholds of individual regenerated fibers with diameters &gt;2 Âµm were found to be lower compared to same caliber undisrupted fibers at electrode to fiber distances of less than about 90-140 Âµm but roughly equal or higher for larger distances. Caliber redistributions observed in regenerated nerve resulted in an overall increase in average recruitment thresholds and chronaxie during whole nerve stimulation. Modeling results also suggest that large diameter undisrupted fibers located close to a longitudinally restricted current source such as the MSE have higher average recruitment thresholds compared to small diameter fibers. In contrast, large diameter regenerated nerve fibers located in close proximity of MSE sites have, on average, lower recruitment thresholds compared to small fibers. Utilizing regenerated fiber morphometry and caliber distributions resulted in accurate predictions of in-vivo recruitment data.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our work uses computational modeling to show how morphometric differences between regenerated and undisrupted tissue results in recruitment threshold discrepancies, quantifies these differences, and illustrates how large undisrupted nerve fibers close to longitudinally restricted current sources have higher recruitment thresholds compared to adjacently positioned smaller fibers while the opposite is true for large regenerated fibers.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192607,2017,Modelling the impact of altered axonal morphometry on the response of regenerative nervous tissue to electrical stimulation through macro-sieve electrodes.,y
2025,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this work is to improve the state of the art for motor-control with a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs use neurological recording devices and a decoding algorithms to transform brain activity directly into real-time control of a machine, archetypically a robotic arm or a cursor. The standard procedure treats neural activity--vectors of spike counts in small temporal windows--as noisy observations of the kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration) of the fingertip. Inferring the state from the observations then takes the form of a \emph{dynamical filter}, typically some variant on Kalman's (KF). The KF, however, although fairly robust in practice, is optimal only when the relationships between variables are linear and the noise is Gaussian, conditions usually violated in practice.


APPROACH
To overcome these limitations we introduce a new filter, the ""recurrent exponential-family harmonium"" (rEFH), that models the spike counts explicitly as Poisson-distributed, and allows for arbitrary nonlinear dynamics and observation models. Furthermore, the model underlying the filter is acquired through unsupervised learning, which allows temporal correlations in spike counts to be explained by latent dynamics that do not necessarily correspond to the kinematic state of the fingertip.


MAIN RESULTS
We test the rEFH on offline reconstruction of the kinematics of reaches in the plane. The rEFH outperforms the standard, as well as three other state-of-the-art, decoders, across three monkeys, two different tasks, most kinematic variables, and a range of bin widths, amounts of training data, and numbers of neurons.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our algorithm establishes a new state of the art for offline decoding of reaches---in particular, for fingertip velocities, the variable used for control in most online decoders.&#13.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192609,2017,"Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm.",y

This study examines the use of the number of night-time sleep disturbances as a health-based metric to assess the cost effectiveness of rail noise mitigation strategies for situations, wherein high-intensity noises dominate such as freight train pass-bys and wheel squeal.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty residential properties adjacent to the existing and proposed rail tracks in a noise catchment area of the Epping to Thornleigh Third Track project were used as a case study. Awakening probabilities were calculated for individual's awakening 1, 3 and 5 times a night when subjected to 10 independent freight train pass-by noise events using internal maximum sound pressure levels (LAFmax).


RESULTS
Awakenings were predicted using a random intercept multivariate logistic regression model. With source mitigation in place, the majority of the residents were still predicted to be awoken at least once per night (median 88.0%), although substantial reductions in the median probabilities of awakening three and five times per night from 50.9 to 29.4% and 9.2 to 2.7%, respectively, were predicted. This resulted in a cost-effective estimate of 7.6-8.8 less people being awoken at least three times per night per A$1 million spent on noise barriers.


CONCLUSION
The study demonstrates that an easily understood metric can be readily used to assist making decisions related to noise mitigation for large-scale transport projects.",India,Noise & health,29192613,2017,A Health-Based Metric for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Noise Barrier Mitigation Associated With Transport Infrastructure Noise.,y
2028,"CONTEXT
According to the attention restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors.


AIMS
By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50-min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40â€‰min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were re-tested. The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately re-tested. The difference between the two test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents the attention restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig.â€‰=â€‰0.027 (<0.050)].


RESULTS
The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95%) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8.4), 'traffic sounds group' (2.4) and 'machine sounds group' (-1.8).


CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, have a positive effect on the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration.",India,Noise & health,29192615,2017,Effects of Soundscape on the Environmental Restoration in Urban Natural Environments.,y
2029,"INTRODUCTION
Hyperacusis is defined as a reduction in tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Hyperacusis can occur in individuals of all age groups, making daily life difficult for the sufferers. Although there is no objective test to accurately diagnose hyperacusis, questionnaires are useful for the assessment of hyperacusis. The aim of this study was to explore the reduced sound tolerance in university students using a hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 536 university students (300 females and 236 males) aged between 18 and 25 years, with a mean age of 21.34â€‰Â±â€‰1.87 years, were assessed using an HQ developed by Khalfa. The mean total score of all the participants was 16.34â€‰Â±â€‰7.91, and 5.78% of the participants had total scores indicating hyperacusis, where a majority of them were females.


RESULTS
Females had significantly higher scores than men in terms of both the total and the attentional and emotional dimensions. The scores of the participants who reported noise exposure or a decrease in their tolerance to noise were significantly higher than those of the other participants. Even among young adults, there was a group of participants suffering from some problems related to decreased tolerance to everyday sounds.


DISCUSSION
Although the Turkish translation of the HQ seems to be a reliable tool for evaluating hyperacusis in young adults, further work with various populations of different age groups is required to establish validity and to assess the psychometric qualities of the Turkish form.",India,Noise & health,29192616,2017,Assessment of Reduced Tolerance to Sound (Hyperacusis) in University Students.,y
2030,"OBJECTIVE
Children's own ratings and opinions on their schools sound environments add important information on noise sources. They can also provide information on how to further improve and optimize children's learning situation in their classrooms. This study reports on the Swedish translation and application of an evidence-based questionnaire that measures how children perceive the acoustic environment of their school.


STUDY DESIGN
The Swedish version was made using a back-to-back translation. Responses on the questionnaire along with demographic data were collected for 149 children aged 9-13 years of age.


RESULTS
The Swedish translation of the questionnaire can be reduced from 93 to 27 items. The 27 items were distributed over five separate factors measuring different underlying constructs with high internal consistency and high inter-item correlations. The responses demonstrated that the dining hall/canteen and the corridors are the school spaces with the poorest listening conditions. The highest annoyance was reported for tests and reading; next, student-generated sounds occur more frequently within the classroom than any sudden unexpected sounds, and finally, road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms are the most frequently occurring sounds from outside the classroom. Several demographic characteristics could be used to predict the outcome on these factors.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that crowded spaces are most challenging; the children themselves generate most of the noise inside the classroom, but it is also common to hear road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms. The extent of annoyance that noise causes depends on the task but seems most detrimental in tasks, wherein the demands of verbal processing are higher. Finally, children with special support seem to report that they are more susceptible to noise than the typical child.",India,Noise & health,29192618,2017,How Children Perceive the Acoustic Environment of Their School.,y
2031,"BACKGROUND
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is fast becoming a global epidemic, and its prevalence is increasing in children and young adults. The aim of the study was to identify young adults who had type 2 DM or impaired fasting glucose as well as those at risk of these conditions using anthropometric data and behavioral pattern.


METHODOLOGY
Two hundred and twenty newly admitted undergraduates who were randomly selected during the registration process were involved in the study. Anthropometric parameters were measured while information on demographic details, medical history, and family history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method.


RESULTS
Two hundred and seven (94%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4%) had serum glucose> 7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2%) had body mass index <25.0 while 6.8% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day.


CONCLUSION
Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192627,2017,Behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes mellitus among newly admitted undergraduates in a Nigerian University.,y

Seizures are common reasons for neurologic consultations and investigations. In the absence of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scanning of the brain is a reliable and cheaper alternative. Little is known about the pattern of brain lesions in patients with recurrent seizures in Nigeria.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the pattern of significant intracerebral lesions in patients presenting with recurrent seizures in a tertiary hospital in Enugu.


METHODS
All the medical and computer tomography records of patients with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent seizures were reviewed. The study duration was 11 years (January 2003 to December 2013). Relevant data were obtained and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 and GraphPad Prism 6.


RESULTS
The diagnostic yield of CT was 55.1%. Twenty (9.3%) individuals had two lesions each. The significant findings were tumors (20.4%), encephalomalacia (18.9%) and strokes (7.7% (ischemic stroke, 4.1%, intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.1%, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.5%). Hydrocephalus (HCP) was found in 18 (9.2%) cases, and 30% of them occurred together with other lesions. The diagnostic yield increased with age reaching 84.4% from the age of 60 years. Only patients with encephalomalacia were statistically older than those with normal imaging.


CONCLUSION
Computed tomography scan has a high diagnostic yield, especially in elderly patients with recurrent generalized seizures. Brain tumors, encephalomalacia, and HCP are most common causes of recurrent seizures in the adults.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192634,2017,"The Pattern of significant lesions found in computerized tomography scan of recurrent seizure patients at a center in Enugu, Nigeria.",y

Obesity can lead to psychological, social, and medical problems that may negatively affect the quality of life Aim: In our study, we aimed to evaluate the body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life of obese subjects in comparison with normal weighted ones.


METHODS
A total of 494 subjects, aged between 18 and 64 years, were included to the study. Patients with the body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥18.5-24.9 kg/m2 were assigned to the control group; BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 were assigned to the obese patient group. An ethical committee approval with protocol No. of 2011/242 was obtained from the Ethical Committee of EskiÅŸehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine. Interviews were performed two times with obese subjects in the 1st and the 6th month of weight loss program, once with the control group. Data identification form, the form which included the biochemical parameters, Trait Anxiety inventory, State anxiety scale, Quality of Life scale-Short Form [(SF-36)(QOL)], Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), Zung Depression Rating Scale, and Zung Anxiety Rating Scale were applied to participants.


RESULTS
Obesity is more common in women. Obesity reduces the quality of life, negatively affects body perception, and triggers anxiety. Because of their body structure, obese individuals are exposed to social pressure and unethical attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Both health risks and social implications of obesity are important. Further studies are needed to ethically evaluate the psycho-social problems caused by obesity.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192636,2017,"Assessment of body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life among obese and nonobese subjects in Turkey.",y

This review aimed to explore the most contemporary evidence on whether poor oral health and dementia occurs in the same individuals or populations, to outline the nature of the relationship between these two health outcomes and to discuss the implication of any findings for health services and future research. The review was undertaken by a working group comprising consultant clinicians from medicine and dentistry, trainees, public health and academic staff. Whilst other rapid reviews in the current series limited their search to systematic reviews, this review focused on primary research involving cohort and case-control studies because of the lack of high level evidence in this new and important field. The results suggest that poor oral hygiene is associated with dementia, and more so amongst people in advanced stages of the disease. Suboptimal oral health (gingivitis, dental caries, tooth loss, edentulousness) appears to be associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.

2038,"Introduction Communication within the doctor-patient relationship is complex due to a variety of reasons; a patient's understanding may not correspond with the clinician's vocabulary, resulting in misunderstanding, anxiety and ill-informed decision making. We investigated the understanding of terminology commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine clinics.Methods We investigated patients' understanding using a questionnaire-based study in the out-patient setting. Age, gender, first language and highest educational level were recorded. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions regarding patients' understanding of words as well as asking patients to define certain terms. Vocabulary included 'ulcer', 'blister', 'cancer', 'malignant' and 'benign'.Results and conclusions Many patients have difficulty in understanding and explaining commonly used terminology. 'Blister' was the most commonly understood term, while 'benign' and 'lesion' were the least well understood. 'Tumour' was mistakenly thought of as synonymous with 'malignancy' by over a third of patients. Understanding was better among those for whom English was their first language. It is essential that all clinicians modify their language appropriately during consultations in order to deliver information in a comprehensive manner, to educate patients on their condition thus enabling informed decision making by patients.",England,British dental journal,29192691,2017,Patient understanding of commonly used oral medicine terminology.,y

RESULTS
We had a 44% response rate at 9 months after birth or loss from 377 bereaved mothers and 232 with surviving infants. Bereaved women were less likely to have hospital staff or family members present at delivery. African-American (versus Caucasian) mothers were half as likely to have first heard about their stillbirth from a physician or midwife.

Although incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms appears to be a barrier to successful self-care, there are few studies examining the relationship between self-care and levels of comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.


AIM
To determine whether incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms is associated with self-care in heart failure patients who were recently discharged from the hospital due to heart failure exacerbation.


METHODS
Patients completed the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale and questionnaire to assess knowledge of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Three groups were formed by their different levels of understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether these three levels of understanding groups predicted self-care after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.


RESULTS
Of 571 patients 22.1%, 40.1% and 37.8% had poor, moderate, and complete understanding, respectively. Compared with patients in the poor understanding group, patients in complete and moderate understanding groups were more likely to have better adherence to self-care activities (standardized Î² = -0.14, 95% confidence interval -3.41, -0.47; standardized Î² = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -4.26, -1.23, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS

To maximise the benefits obtainable from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, an evaluation of physical fitness using reliable, clinically relevant tests is strongly recommended. Recently, objective tests of physical fitness have been implemented in the SWEDEHEART register. The reliability of these tests has, however, not been examined for patients with acute coronary syndrome.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of the symptom-limited bicycle ergometer test, the dynamic unilateral heel-lift test and the unilateral shoulder-flexion test in patients with acute coronary syndrome.


METHODS
In a longitudinal study design, a total of 40 patients (mean age 63.8 Â± 9.5 years, five women), with ACS, aged < 75 years, were included at a university hospital in Sweden. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval, standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsiveness in terms of the minimal detectable change were calculated.


RESULTS
Excellent reliability was found, showing ICC values of 0.98 (0.96-0.99), SEM 4.71 for the bicycle ergometer test, ICC 0.87 (0.75-0.93), SEM 4.62 for the shoulder-flexion test and ICC 0.84 (0.71-0.91), SEM 2.24 for the heel-lift test.

The ILFAS was developed using methodologies and principles from Lean/Shingo, IPCP, metacognition research and Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains. A panel of experts confirmed the initial face validity of the instrument. Researchers independently assessed five facilitators, during six Lean sessions. Analysis included quantitative evaluation of rater agreement. Overall inter-rater agreement of the assessment of facilitator performance was high (92%), and discrepancies in the agreement statistics were analysed. Face and content validity were further established, and usability was evaluated, through primary stakeholder post-pilot feedback, uncovering minor concerns, leading to tool revision.

2046,"Introduction Hypertension is one of the primary modifiable risk factors for cardiac and renal diseases. The prevalence of hypertension appears to be around 30-45% of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The administration of blood pressure-lowering drugs is to reduce the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes: stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths. Hypertension guidelines recommend combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk and with subclinical organ damage as well as when monotherapy fails. Areas covered As the etiology of essential hypertension is multifactorial, combination therapy using different classes of antihypertensive agents have greater effect than each on its own (synergistic effect), may have better tolerability (two components minimizing each other's side effects) and lead to improved patient compliance. Several studies assess the hypotensive efficacy on drug combination, there are also studies n triple drug combination. Expert commentary At present, dual and triple combination therapy is available to hypertensive patients with good clinical outcomes, compliance and low profile of side effects. Hypertensive patients usually have other cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. As patients' adherence to the pharmacological therapy significantly decreases the risk of long-term adverse events including mortality, use of single-pill combination therapy are not only good effects of free therapy but also better patient compliance. It appears that combinations not only of hypotensive drugs but also with statins will be widely used.

This study A) assessed whether levels of alcohol-related disciplinary actions on college campuses changed among MD college students after the 2011 Maryland (MD) state alcohol tax increase from 6% to 9%, and B) determined which school-level factors impacted the magnitude of changes detected.


METHOD
A quasi-experimental interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of panel data containing alcohol-related disciplinary actions on 33 MD college campuses in years 2006-2013. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in counts of alcohol-related disciplinary actions comparing time before and after the tax increase.


RESULTS
The ITS anaysis showed an insignificant relationship between alcohol-related disciplinary actions and tax implementation (Î² = -.27; p =.257) but indicated that alcohol-related disciplinary actions decreased significantly over the time under study (Î² = -.05; p =.022).


DISCUSSION
Alcohol related disciplinary actions did decrease over time in the years of study, and this relationship was correlated with several school-level characteristics, including school price, school funding type, types of degrees awarded, and specialty.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques.


METHODS
Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6Â mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28Â days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations.


RESULTS
FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions.

2050,"Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths.

2053,The amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insights into AÎ²-interacting proteins are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity. We recently undertook an in-depth in vitro interrogation of the AÎ²1-42 interactome using human frontal lobes as the biological source material and taking advantage of advances in mass spectrometry performance characteristics. These analyses uncovered the small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) to be the most selectively enriched binder to oligomeric AÎ²1-42. Subsequent validation experiments revealed that SST interferes with AÎ² fibrillization and promotes the formation of AÎ² assemblies characterized by a 50-60Â kDa SDS-resistant core. The distributions of SST and AÎ² overlap in the brain and SST has been linked to AD by several additional observations. This perspective summarizes this body of literature and draws attention to the fact that SST is one of several neuropeptide hormones that acquire amyloid properties before their synaptic release. The latter places the interaction between SST and AÎ² among an increasing number of observations that attest to the ability of amyloidogenic proteins to influence each other. A model is presented which attempts to reconcile existing data on the involvement of SST in the AD etiology.,United States,Prion,29192843,2017,Somatostatin in Alzheimer'S disease: A new Role for an Old Player.,y

2055,"OBJECTIVE The acquisition and refinement of cognitive and behavioral skills during development is associated with the maturation of various brain oscillatory activities. Most developmental investigations have identified distinct patterns of low-frequency electrophysiological activity that are characteristic of various behavioral milestones. In this investigation, the authors focused on the cross-sectional developmental properties of high-frequency spectral power from the brain's default mode network (DMN) during goal-directed behavior. METHODS The authors contrasted regionally specific, time-evolving high gamma power (HGP) in the lateral DMN cortex between 3 young children (age range 3-6 years) and 3 adults by use of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings over the left perisylvian cortex during a picture-naming task. RESULTS Across all participants, a nearly identical and consistent response suppression of HGP, which is a functional signature of the DMN, was observed during task performance recordings acquired from ECoG electrodes placed over the lateral DMN cortex.

We compared the heterogeneity of handwritten texts in tasks with different cognitive demands; the heterogeneity of texts was analyzed with lacunarity, a measure of geometrical invariance. In Experiment 1, we asked participants to perform two tasks that varied in cognitive demands: transcription and exposition about an autobiographical episode. Lacunarity was significantly lower in transcription. In Experiment 2, we compared a veridical and a fictitious version of a personal event. Lacunarity was lower in veridical texts.

2057,"Human figure drawing tasks such as the Draw-a-Person test have long been used to assess intelligence (F. Goodenough, 1926). The authors investigate the skills tapped by drawing and the risk factors associated with poor drawing. Self-portraits of 345 preschool children were scored by raters trained in using the Draw-a-Person Intellectual Ability test (DAP:IQ) rubric (C. R. Reynolds & J. A. Hickman, 2004). Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192871,2017,What Does the DAP:IQ Measure?: Drawing Comparisons between Drawing Performance and Developmental Assessments.,y

2060,"OBJECTIVE Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, more patients with a high body mass index (BMI) will require surgical treatment for degenerative spinal disease. In previous investigations of lumbar spine pathology, obesity has been associated with worsened postoperative outcomes and increased costs. However, few studies have examined the association between BMI and postoperative outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes, postoperative narcotics consumption, complications, and hospital costs among BMI stratifications for patients who have undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF procedures. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained surgical database of patients who had undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spinal pathology between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified by BMI as follows: normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), or obese II-III (â‰¥ 35.0 kg/m2). Differences in patient demographics and preoperative characteristics were compared across the BMI cohorts using 1-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Multivariate linear or Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine the presence of an association between BMI category and narcotics utilization, improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores, incidence of complications, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, and hospital costs. Regression analyses were controlled for preoperative demographic and procedural characteristics. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients were included in the analysis, of whom 20.9% (n = 58) were normal weight, 37.5% (n = 104) were overweight, 24.9% (n = 69) were obese I, and 16.6% (n = 46) were obese II-III. A higher BMI was associated with an older age (p = 0.049) and increased comorbidity burden (p = 0.001). No differences in sex, smoking status, insurance type, diagnosis, presence of neuropathy, or preoperative VAS pain scores were found among the BMI cohorts (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found among these cohorts as regards operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and number of operative levels (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in postoperative narcotics consumption, VAS score improvement, complication rates, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, or total direct costs existed across BMI stratifications (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher BMI demonstrated surgical outcomes, narcotics consumption, and hospital costs comparable to those of patients with a lower BMI. Thus, ACDF procedures are both safe and effective for all patients across the entire BMI spectrum. Patients should be counseled to expect similar rates of postoperative complications and eventual clinical improvement regardless of their BMI.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

2061,"In response to varying stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor is able to promote repair, survival, or elimination of damaged cells - processes that have great relevance to organismal aging. Although the link between p53 and cancer is well established, the contribution of p53 to the aging process is less clear. Delineating how p53 regulates distinct aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered metabolic pathways will be critical. Mouse models have further revealed the centrality and complexity of the p53 network in aging processes. While naturally aged mice have linked longevity with declining p53 function, some accelerated aging mice present with chronic p53 activation, whose phenotypes can be rescued upon p53 deficiency. Further, direct modulation of the p53-MDM2 axis has correlated elevated p53 activity with either early aging or with delayed-onset aging. We speculate that p53-mediated aging phenotypes in these mice must have (1) stably active p53 due to MDM2 dysregulation or chronic stress or (2) shifted p53 outcomes. Pinpointing which p53 stressors, modifications, and outcomes drive aging processes will provide further insights into our understanding of the human aging process and could have implications for both cancer and aging therapeutics.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cdd.2017.187.",England,Cell death and differentiation,29192902,2017,Relevance of the p53-MDM2 axis to aging.,y

In recent years, the recovery-oriented approaches (along with experiences and thoughts of patients and patient's relatives) have been taken into account for establishing mental health services and policies. This study aims to identify the factors contributing to recovery, as observed from the perspective of schizophrenia patients working at The Blue Horse CafÃ© which was founded by the Federation of Schizophrenia Associations.


METHOD
The sample for the study consisted of 24 patients who worked at The Blue Horse CafÃ©. A phenomenological approach was used in the study, whereby interviews with patients were analyzed qualitatively.


RESULTS
Certain common factors, which were expressed as having contributed to recovery, were identified from the perspective of schizophrenia patients. These factors are: 1-The fact that the setting is informal and welcoming without being constrictive; 2-Predominance of the human element; 3-Hope and encouragement; 4-Being cared about; 5-Being able to reach someone when in need of support; 6-Friendly sharing; 7-Having a purpose, assuming responsibility, and being motivated; and 8-Giving meaning to life.


CONCLUSION
The findings may serve as a stimulus since schizophrenia patients that contribute to recovery give mental health professionals the opportunity to question there need for a change in their professional roles.

Impairment in immune functions is proposed as a key factor in the cognitive decline in bipolar disorder (BD) however there is scarcity of research on the impact of inflammation on cognitive functions. Our aim is to compare IL-18 and IL-6 levels in BD patients and controls and to study the relationship between IL-18 and IL-6 levels and cognitive impairment METHOD: Thirty-six euthymic BD-I patients and 38 age, sex and educational level matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants were evaluated with neurocognitive tests. The plasma IL-6 and IL-18 levels of both groups were measured with ELISA kits.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between IL-6 and IL-18 levels of patient and healthy control groups. In the patient group, IL-18 level was positively correlated with completed categories score wheras there was a negative correlation with perseverative response and perseverative errors. Moreover IL-18 level was positively correlated with immediate recall, delayed recall and learning scores while there was a negative correlation with stroop interference scores. No correlation was found between IL-6 level and neuropsychological test scores in the patient group.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study that investigates the relation of IL-18 with cognitive functions.

This study aimed to examine the cognitive profiles of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the latter of which was recently standardized in Turkey. In addition, the reading abilities and intelligence scores of these children were also investigated.


METHODS
A total of 48 children with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 16 years who were outpatients in MuÅŸ State Hospital were included in this study. The children were administered the WISC-R, the WISC-IV, and the Oral Reading Skills and Reading Comprehension Test (ORCT).


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the WISC-R IQ scores and WISC-IV index scores. Moreover, reading comprehension skills (derived from ORCT scores) were predicted with significant accuracy by both the WISC-R Verbal IQ and the WISC-IV WMI (Working Memory Index).


CONCLUSION
Results of this study suggest that the WISC-R and the WISC-IV scale are not sufficient for obtaining a specific cognitive profile for ADHD - there is no significant difference between them. However, the four-factor structure of the WISC-IV is believed to provide more specific information. In addition, results of this study related to reading skills indicate that the importance of reading skills should not be overlooked when assessing children with ADHD.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192943,2017,[Comparing Two Editions of Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Assessing Reading Skills in Children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder].,y

We aimed to review the literature related to attention, memory, and executive functions in PTSD. Although studies on the subject are limited (in that there is no uniformity in terms of trauma type, selection of the control groups or types of neuropsychological tests used), most reported similar deficits in PTSD subjects in terms of memory and executive functions including attention. Since the presence of psychiatric comorbidities may disrupt neuropsychological functions, results of studies that have not controlled comorbidity may be questionable. However, studies that excluded the comorbid conditions reported similar deficits in cognitive functions in PTSD patients. The relationship between recovery from PTSD symptoms and change in cognitive functions has been examined in only a few studies, and most have reported an improvement for both memory and executive functions in remitted patients. The improvement in executive functions, however, has been limited by the difficulty of task. Cognitive deficits have been among the major causes of disabilities in PTSD patients.

FL damage can lead to executive dysfunction by influencing frontal-subcortical circuits (dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, ventromedial). Damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can lead to deterioration in EF, whereas damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) can lead to personality changes with the characteristic of disinhibition and irritability. In addition, damage to the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) can result in decreased spontaneity. Neuropsychological tests are important components in the assessment of EF including goal-directed behavior, decision-making, risk assessment, making plans for the future, setting of priorities and order of our actions. Clinical conditions affecting frontal-subcortical connections outside of the FL can also lead to executive dysfunctions and frontal lobe syndrome (FLS).

Dementia-related behavioral symptoms and functional dependence result in poor quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The goal was to determine whether a home-based activity program (Tailored Activity Program; TAP-VA) would reduce behavioral symptoms and functional dependence of veterans with dementia and caregiver burden.


DESIGN
Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).


SETTING
Veteran's homes.


PARTICIPANTS
Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).


INTERVENTION
Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.


MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.


RESULTS
Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control). At 4 months, compared to controls, the TAP-VA group showed reductions in number (difference in mean change from baseline = -0.68, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.13) and frequency by severity (-24.3, 95% CI = -45.6 to -3.1) of behavioral symptoms, number of activities needing assistance with (-0.80, 95% CI = -1.41 to -0.20), functional dependence level (4.09, 95% CI = 1.06, 7.13), and pain (-1.18, 95% CI = -2.10 to -0.26). Caregivers of veterans in TAP-VA reported less behavior-related distress. Benefits did not extend to 8 months.

Smoke-free laws reduce disease prevalence. The impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky was examined. The authors hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of smoke-free laws.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of 83,727 Kentucky residents agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50 years who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 1995 to 2014. In 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free laws. County-level characteristics included adult smoking rate, sex, race/ethnicity, income, physician supply, observed radon values, and rurality.


RESULTS
Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The difference in lung cancer incidence between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws did not confer the same benefit. One hundred percent smoke-free laws, covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions, may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.

2072,"Our contribution assesses the role of information barriers for patterns of participation in Higher Education (HE) and the related social inequalities. For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62 Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs, economic returns and chances of success of investments in different tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect varied substantially by parental social class and level of education. The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates increased their participation in more rewarding university fields. Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects. Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.",England,The British journal of sociology,29193014,2017,Information barriers and social stratification in higher education: evidence from a field experiment.,y

To examine the diagnostic ability of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <36wks postmenstrual age) to detect later adverse motor outcomes or cerebral palsy (CP) in infants born preterm.


METHOD
Studies of infants born preterm with MRI earlier than 36 weeks postmenstrual age and quantitative motor data or a diagnosis of CP at or beyond 1 year corrected age were identified. Study details were extracted and meta-analyses performed where possible. Quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 (a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies).


RESULTS
Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which reported diagnostic accuracy and five reported data sufficient for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. Early structural MRI global scores detected a later diagnosis of CP with a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86-100) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 59-100). Global structural MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 44-100) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 90-100). White matter scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 20-48) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 78-88).


INTERPRETATION
Early structural MRI has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine adverse motor outcomes and CP in infants born preterm. Greater reporting of diagnostic accuracy in studies examining relationships with motor outcomes and CP is required to facilitate clinical utility of early MRI.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine later adverse motor outcomes and cerebral palsy (CP).

To examine the factors contributing to nurses choosing to exit the nursing profession before retirement age.


BACKGROUND
Population growth, ageing and growing demand for health services mean increased demand for nurses. Better retention could help meet this demand, yet little work has been done in New Zealand to understand early attrition.


METHODS
An online survey of registered and enrolled nurses and nurse practitioners who had left nursing was used. This study reports analysis of responses from 285 ex-nurses aged under 55.


FINDINGS
The primary reasons nurses left the profession were as follows: workplace concerns; personal challenges; career factors; family reasons; lack of confidence; leaving for overseas; unwillingness to complete educational requirements; poor work-life balance; and inability to find suitable nursing work. Most nurses discussed their intentions to leave with a family member or manager and most reported gaining transferrable skills through nursing.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses leave for many reasons. Implementing positive practice environments and individualized approaches to retaining staff may help reduce this attrition. Generational changes in the nature of work and careers mean that nurses may continue to leave the profession sooner than anticipated by policymakers.


IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
If the nursing workforce is to be able to meet projected need, education, recruitment and retention policies must urgently address issues leading to early attrition. In particular, policies improving the wider environmental context of nursing practice and ensuring that working environments are safe and nurses are well supported must be developed and implemented. Equally, national nursing workforce planning must take into account that nursing is no longer viewed as a career for life.",England,International nursing review,29193041,2017,Early nurse attrition in New Zealand and associated policy implications.,y

2076,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic sleep deficiency is associated with early mortality. In the epileptic population, there is a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, and individuals with severe refractory epilepsy are at greater risk of premature mortality than the general population. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affects 1:1000 cases of epilepsy each year. Ketogenic diet (KD) treatment is one of the few effective options for refractory seizures. Despite KD reducing seizures and increasing longevity in Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, they still succumb to sudden death. This study aims to determine whether (1) the rest profiles of KO and KD-treated KO (KOKD) mice resemble each other as a function of either age or proximity to death and (2) the timing of death correlates with acute or chronic changes in rest.


METHODS
Noninvasive actimetry was used to monitor rest throughout the lives of KO and wild-type (WT) littermates administered standard diet or KD.


RESULTS
As KO mice age, rest is reduced (PÂ <Â .0001). Rest is significantlyÂ improved in KDKO mice (PÂ <Â .0001), resembling WT values at several ages. When age is removed as a variable and data are realigned to the day of death, the rest profiles of KO and KOKD groups worsen to similar degrees as a function of proximity to death. The amount of rest acutely is not sensitive to the timing of death, whereas chronic rest deficiency profiles (10-15Â days prior to death) of both groups were indistinguishable. Chronic accumulation of rest deficiency over the final 15Â days was associated with 75% of deaths.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our data suggest that the accumulated rest deficiency is associated with sudden death in Kv1.1 KO mice. These data (1) support the proposed clinical hypothesis that chronic sleep deficiency may be associated with early mortality in epileptic patients and (2) warrant future preclinical and clinical studies on sleep monitoring in epileptic patients.",United States,Epilepsia,29193044,2017,"Accumulation of rest deficiency precedes sudden death of epileptic Kv1.1 knockout mice, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",y

2078,"Since culturally salient stimuli for emotion recognition are scarce in India, we developed and validated a set of 140 coloured pictures of six basic emotions along with a neutral expression. The expressions were posed by four expressers, two males and two females, with mean age of 25.25 (SD 3.77) years. The expressions were captured from five different angles keeping the background uniform. These pictures were shown to 350 undergraduates who labelled the emotion and rated their intensity.

2079,"OBJECTIVE
Using a ""double-pulse"" adaptation paradigm, in which two stimuli are presented in quick succession, this study examines the neural mechanisms underlying potentiation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in visual snow syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous ""double-pulse"" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.


METHODS
We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.


RESULTS
In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",United States,Headache,29193050,2017,Antagonistic Relationship Between VEP Potentiation and Gamma Power in Visual Snow Syndrome.,y
2080,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies show migraineurs are at an increased risk of developing suicidal behaviors, even after controlling for comorbid depression. However, previous research has not examined the impact of psychiatric mood disorders on suicidal behaviors in migraineurs within a nationally representative sample.


OBJECTIVE
A cross-sectional study was used to investigate the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors and determine whether psychiatric comorbidities modify this association in a nationwide inpatient cohort.


METHODS
We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations compiled from USA billing data. Migraine, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric disorders were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes from hospitalization discharges (2007-2012). Weighted national estimates were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
156,172,826 hospitalizations were included, of which 1.4% had a migraine diagnosis and 1.6% had a diagnosis of suicidal behavior. Migraineurs had a 2.07-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.96-2.19) compared with non-migraineurs. We repeated analyses after stratifying by depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among hospitalizations with depression, migraine was associated with a 20% reduced odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 0.76-0.85). Among hospitalizations without depression, migraine was associated with 2.35-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 2.20-2.51). In stratified analyses, we noted that among hospitalizations with anxiety, migraineurs had slightly increased odds of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.13). Among hospitalizations without anxiety, migraine was associated with a 2.06-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.94-2.20). Similarly, in analyses stratified by PTSD, migraine was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94-1.07) among those with PTSD. However, the odds of suicidal behaviors were increased among hospitalizations without PTSD (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.84-2.08).


CONCLUSION
Chronic conditions that do not affect the current hospitalization may not have been reported. The presence of psychiatric diagnoses influences associations of suicidal behaviors with migraine in a national inpatient sample.

2081,"Variation in the shape of the human face and in stature is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental influences. One such environmental influence is malnourishment, which can result in growth faltering, usually diagnosed by means of comparing an individual's stature with a set of age-appropriate standards. These standards for stature, however, are typically ascertained in groups where people are at low risk for growth faltering. Moreover, genetic differences among populations with respect to stature are well established, further complicating the generalizability of stature-based diagnostic tools. In a large sample of children aged 5-19 years, we obtained high-resolution genomic data, anthropometric measures and 3D facial images from individuals within and around the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. With genome-wide complex trait analysis, we partitioned genetic and environmental variance for growth outcomes and facial shape. We found that children with growth faltering have faces that look like those of older and taller children, in a direction opposite to the expected allometric trajectory, and in ways predicted by the environmental portion of covariance at the community and individual levels. The environmental variance for facial shape varied subtly but significantly among communities, whereas genetic differences were minimal. These results reveal that facial shape preserves information about exposure to undernourishment, with important implications for refining assessments of nutritional status in children and the developmental-genetics of craniofacial variation alike.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193055,2017,Facial shape manifestations of growth faltering in Tanzanian children.,y
2082,"OBJECTIVE
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive change resulting from challenging life events. The current study examined factors associated with PTG in traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.


METHOD
Participants (NÂ =Â 221) in this prospective cohort study included adults admitted to a Level I trauma center. Over half the participants (60%) were male, with a mean age of 47. Participants completed baseline measures during hospitalization. PTG was assessed at 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Greater PTG was associated with minority race/ethnicity, lower income, automotive collision, and premorbid psychological disorder other than depression or posttraumatic stress (PTS). These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients. Analysis confirmed that greater PTS at follow-up was associated with more growth.


CONCLUSION
Participants with the most growth also experienced the most distress.

2083,"The adolescent brain is vulnerable to long-lasting cognitive disturbances resulting from nicotine exposure. Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED) and high- (HE), moderate- (ME) and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30 min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with Î±7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical Î±7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

The highest break points occurred during the token reinforcement condition for two out of three participants, but response rates tended to be higher with edibles. We then evaluated the effects of presession access to edibles on the break points of edible items and tokens with two participants. Break points decreased only in the edible reinforcement condition, and the participants chose to work for leisure items rather than edibles when presession access to edibles was in place.

In an Internet study, participants who first completed verbal attitude measures were more likely to donate to a Jewish organisation compared to those who completed the measures after making the decision to donate. Moreover, responses to attitude measures of various types and donating to the Jewish organisation were correlated when attitudes had been expressed in the first step. When attitudes were measured after the decision to donate, only the responses to the traditional anti-Semitic scale were correlated with this behaviour. In the field study, in which the time interval between attitude and behaviour measures was introduced, no question-behaviour effect was observed.

2086,"Auditory brainstem neurons are functionally primed to fire action potentials (APs) at markedly high-rates in order to rapidly encode acoustic information of sound. This specialization is critical for survival and the comprehension of behaviourally relevant communication functions, including sound localization and understanding speech in noise. Here, we investigated underlying ion channel mechanisms essential for high-rate AP firing in neurons of the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM) - the avian analog of bushy cells of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In addition to the established function of high-voltage activated potassium channels, we found that resurgent sodium current (INaR ) plays a role in regulating rapid firing activity of late-developing (embryonic [E] days 19-21) NM neurons. INaR of late-developing NM neurons showed similar properties with mammalian neurons in that its unique mechanism of an ""open channel block state"" facilitated the recovery and increased the availability of sodium (NaV ) channels after depolarization. Using a computational model of NM neurons, we demonstrated that removal of INaR reduced high-rate AP firing. We found weak INaR during a prehearing period (E11-12), which transformed to resemble late-developing INaR properties around hearing onset (E14-16). Anatomically, we detected strong NaV 1.6 expression near maturation, which became increasingly less distinct at hearing onset and prehearing periods, suggesting that multiple NaV channel subtypes may contribute to INaR during development. We conclude that INaR plays an important role in regulating rapid AP firing for NM neurons, a property that may be evolutionarily conserved for functions related to similar avian and mammalian hearing.

2087,"This study aimed to investigate whether variable patterns of responses can be acquired and maintained by negative reinforcement under an avoidance contingency. Six male Wistar rats were exposed to sessions in which behavioral variability was reinforced according to a Lag contingency: Sequences of three responses on two levers had to differ from one, two or three previous sequences for shocks to be avoided (Lag 1, Lag 2 and Lag 3, respectively). Performance under the Lag conditions was compared with performance on a Yoke condition in which the animals received the same reinforcement frequency and distribution as in the Lag condition but behavioral variability was not required. The results showed that most of the subjects varied their sequences under the Lag contingencies, avoiding shocks with relatively high probability (â‰¥ 0.7). Under the Yoke procedure, responding continued to occur with high probability, but the behavioral variability decreased. These results suggest that behavioral variability can be negatively reinforced.",United States,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,29193141,2017,Behavioral variability as avoidance behavior.,y
2088,"BACKGROUND
Exposure to alcohol content in movies has been shown to be associated with adolescent use of alcohol, including earlier onset. This study examined the influence of movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol onset, considering the social context (whether the movie was viewed with a friend or parent). We examined whether media's influence holds across a spectrum of early drinking milestones: sipping (but not consuming a full drink of) alcohol, consuming a full drink of alcohol, and engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED).


METHODS
Data were taken from a sample of 882 middle school youth (52% female; 24% non-White) enrolled in an ongoing study on alcohol initiation and progression. Exposure to alcohol content in films was measured using a method that combines content analysis and random assignment of movie titles to youth surveys. The hazard of initiating alcohol use (sip, full drink, HED) as a function of exposure was estimated using survival analysis. Associations were adjusted for demographic, personality, and social influence factors known to be associated with both movie exposure and alcohol use.


RESULTS
Exposure to alcohol content was common. Hours of exposure prospectively predicted earlier onset of alcohol involvement across all outcomes. Viewing movies with friends appeared to augment the media exposure effect, in contrast to viewing movies with parents, which was not a significant predictor of initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to alcohol in films is involved in the entry into early stages of alcohol involvement. Findings support further investigation into the role of the media in underage drinking, especially in the context of consuming media with friends and peers. Limiting media exposure and/or stronger Federal Trade Commission oversight of movie ratings should be a priority for preventing underage drinking.",England,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",29193150,2017,Exposure to Alcohol Content in Movies and Initiation of Early Drinking Milestones.,y

We adopted a qualitative descriptive method and conducted semi-structured interviews with female patients diagnosed with infertility. Participants were recruited at a high-volume fertility clinic in Tianjin, China. Fifteen women with a diagnosis of infertility were interviewed for 60-90â€‰min. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Two themes supported the importance of childbearing for Chinese women with infertility: childbearing as natural law, and childbearing for relational harmony. Childbearing as natural law referred to intrinsic forces to seek a child, including (i) achieving motherhood and womanhood and (ii) experiencing a developmental transition with childbearing as a landmark. Relational harmony included three primary factors: (i) to maintain marital quality by preventing marital failure and rejuvenating an unsatisfactory marital relationship; (ii) to fulfill both authoritative and reciprocal filial piety; (iii) to build a sense of normalcy within family and social networks. In summary, infertility resulted in loss of motherhood, womanhood, and a smooth developmental transition. Moreover, it threatened relationship harmony in the marriage, family, and social life. These insights on the value of childbearing in the Chinese context can inform healthcare professionals in identify infertility-related demands and developing relevant psychosocial services for people with infertility.",United States,Research in nursing & health,29193167,2017,Childbearing importance: A qualitative study of women with infertility in China.,y

As the workforce ages, occupational injuries from falls on the same level will increase. Some industries may be more affected than others.

RESULTS
Same-level fall injury incidence rates increase with age in all four sectors. However, patterns of rate ratios and rate differences vary by age group, gender, and industry. Younger workers, men, and manufacturing workers generally have lower rates.

2092,"Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of emerging infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour changes on epidemics can be key to improving control efforts. However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases. Therefore, in terms of mitigating emerging infectious diseases, both media publicity focused on how to guide people's behaviour change and positive responses of individuals are critical.",England,Statistics in medicine,29193194,2017,Impact of individual behaviour change on the spread of emerging infectious diseases.,y

While it is known that informal caregiving is associated with care-derived self-esteem cross-sectionally, little is known about the impact of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. Thus, we aimed at examining whether informal caregiving affects general self-esteem using a longitudinal approach.


METHODS
Data were gathered from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 40 and over in Germany from 2002 to 2014 (n = 21 271). General self-esteem was quantified using the Rosenberg scale. Individuals were asked whether they provide informal care regularly.


RESULTS
Fixed effects regressions showed no significant effect of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. General self-esteem decreased with increasing morbidity, increasing age, decreasing social ties, whereas it was not associated with changes in employment status, marital status and body mass index. Additional models showed that decreases in self-esteem were associated with decreases in functional health and increases in depressive symptoms.

The older persons lacked knowledge about their condition, which generated poor insight into their medical treatment and this in turn affected their daily life. They had thoughts and questions about their medication, but did not have an opportunity to ask the questions because of lack of follow-up from the healthcare system.

2096,"Animals maintained in captivity exhibit rapid changes in phenotypic traits, which may be maladaptive for natural environments. The phenotype can shift away from the wild phenotype via transgenerational effects, with the environment experienced by parents influencing the phenotype and fitness of offspring. There is emerging evidence that controlling transgenerational effects could help mitigate the effects of captivity, improving the success of captively bred animals post release. However, controlling transgenerational effects requires knowledge of the mechanisms driving transgenerational changes. To better understand the genetic mechanisms that contribute to transgenerational effects in captivity we investigated the heritability of behavioral phenotypes using mid parent- and single parent-offspring regressions in a population of captive-reared house mouse (Mus musculus) that we had previously shown exhibit transgenerational changes in boldness and activity behavioral types. Slopes for boldness and activity were all positive, indicating a low to moderate degree of heritability. Though, none of the heritability estimates were statistically significant due to the large surrounding errors. However, the large error surrounding the heritability estimates may also indicate that there is variability in heritability between behavioral traits within the boldness and activity behavioral types. The implication of this finding is that the potential for heritable genetic changes in captivity varies considerably between traits. We conclude that continued investigation of the potential for traits to evolve in captivity is needed to better inform captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",United States,Zoo biology,29193268,2017,What role does heritability play in transgenerational phenotypic responses to captivity?

2098,"For species at risk of decline or extinction in source-sink systems, sources are an obvious target for habitat protection actions. However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for three endangered species. Using empirically-based habitat-population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of time periods of data collection and prioritized the strongest sources for conservation. We then tested the ability of prioritized patches to identify the most habitats most affecting persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Our results indicated that conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection can impact species persistence. Shorter times series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. As source-sink metrics (i.e., births-deaths; births and immigrations - deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many non-equilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.

2100,"PURPOSE
Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+.


METHODS
Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income.


FINDINGS
In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional. Distinct elements of rural-urban status may influence health in nuanced ways that require additional exploration in future studies.",England,The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,29193298,2017,What Aspects of Rural Life Contribute to Rural-Urban Health Disparities in Older Adults?

2101,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a novel feature refinement MR reconstruction method from highly undersampled multichannel acquisitions for improving the image quality and preserve more detail information.


THEORY AND METHODS
The feature refinement technique, which uses a feature descriptor to pick up useful features from residual image discarded by sparsity constrains, is applied to preserve the details of the image in compressed sensing and parallel imaging in MRI (CS-pMRI). The texture descriptor and structure descriptor recognizing different types of features are required for forming the feature descriptor. Feasibility of the feature refinement was validated using three different multicoil reconstruction methods on in vivo data.


RESULTS
Experimental results show that reconstruction methods with feature refinement improve the quality of reconstructed image and restore the image details more accurately than the original methods, which is also verified by the lower values of the root mean square error and high frequency error norm.


CONCLUSION
A simple and effective way to preserve more useful detailed information in CS-pMRI is proposed. This technique can effectively improve the reconstruction quality and has superior performance in terms of detail preservation compared with the original version without feature refinement.

2103,"Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures and abnormal electrical activity in the brain, is one of the most prevalent brain disorders. Over two million people in the United States have been diagnosed with epilepsy and 3% of the general population will be diagnosed with it at some point in their lives. While most developmental epilepsies occur due to genetic predisposition, a class of ""acquired"" epilepsies results from a variety of brain insults. A leading etiological factor for epilepsy that is currently on the rise is traumatic brain injury (TBI), which accounts for up to 20% of all symptomatic epilepsies. Remarkably, the presence of an identified early insult that constitutes a risk for development of epilepsy provides a therapeutic window in which the pathological processes associated with brain injury can be manipulated to limit the subsequent development of recurrent seizure activity and epilepsy. Recent studies have revealed diverse pathologies, including enhanced excitability, activated immune signaling, cell death, and enhanced neurogenesis within a week after injury, suggesting a period of heightened adaptive and maladaptive plasticity. An integrated understanding of these processes and their cellular and molecular underpinnings could lead to novel targets to arrest epileptogenesis after trauma. This review attempts to highlight and relate the diverse early changes after trauma and their role in development of epilepsy and suggests potential strategies to limit neurological complications in the injured brain.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193309,2017,Converging early responses to brain injury pave the road to epileptogenesis.,y
2104,"The signaling network involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not yet fully understood. This review aims to describe possible mechanisms through which the bacterial modulators may be linked directly or indirectly to the process of alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. From the late 1970s to present, new paradigm shifts have been developed regarding our understanding of pathological bone remodeling in periodontal disease. Upcoming evidence suggests that in periodontal disease the local immune response is exacerbated and involves the existence of signaling pathways that have been shown to modulate bone-cell function leading to alveolar bone loss. Those complex signaling pathways have been observed not only between bacteria but also between bacteria and the gingival surface of the host. More specifically, it has been shown that bacteria, through their secretion molecules, may interact indirectly and directly with immune-type cells of the host, resulting in the production of osteolytic agents that enhance bone resorption. Further research is required to provide a clear understanding of the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, and the availability of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis, may be useful tools in achieving this.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193310,2017,Bacterial modulators of bone remodeling in the periodontal pocket.,y
2105,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should combine individual level participant data across studies of children's responses to disasters to better understand PTSS trajectories.",United States,Journal of traumatic stress,29193316,2017,Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Trajectories Among Children After Disaster Exposure: A Review.,y

2107,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the longitudinal association of dual and single (vision and hearing) sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults.


METHODS
Two thousand eight hundred ninety adults aged 60Â years or over who participated in the longitudinal population-based TromsÃ¸ Study, Norway, were included. The impact of objective vision loss, self-report hearing loss, or dual sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety, as assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 10, was examined at baseline and 6-year follow-up using linear mixed models.


RESULTS
Hearing loss had a cross-sectional relationship with increased depression (bÂ =Â 0.1750, SEÂ =Â 0.07, PÂ =Â .02) and anxiety symptoms (bÂ =Â 0.1765, SEÂ =Â 0.08, PÂ =Â .03); however, these relationships were not significant at the 6-year follow-up. Both vision loss only and dual sensory loss predicted increased depression scores at follow-up (bÂ =Â 0.0220, SEÂ =Â 0.01, PÂ =Â .03; and bÂ =Â 0.0413, SEÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Adjustment for social isolation did not attenuate the main depression results.


CONCLUSION
Dual sensory loss resulted in increased depression symptomatology over time and posed an additional long-term risk to depression severity beyond having a single sensory loss only. Only hearing loss is associated with anxiety symptoms. Older adults with vision, hearing, and dual sensory loss have different mental health profiles. Therefore, management and intervention should be tailored to the type of sensory loss.",England,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,29193338,2017,"The association amongst visual, hearing, and dual sensory loss with depression and anxiety over 6Â years: The TromsÃ¸ Study.",y
2108,"PURPOSE
Dynamic manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) allows assessment of tissue viability by tracing manganese uptake. We aimed to develop a rapid T1 mapping method for dynamic MEMRI to facilitate assessments of murine kidney viability.


METHODS
A multi-slice saturation recovery fast spin echo (MSRFSE) was developed, validated, and subsequently applied in dynamic MEMRI at 16.4T on ischemic mouse kidneys after 4 weeks of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Baseline T1 values and post-contrast R1 (1/T1 ) changes were measured in cortex (CO), outer (OSOM), inner (ISOM) strips of outer medulla, and inner medulla (IM).


RESULTS
Validation studies showed strong agreement between MSRFSE and an established saturation recovery Look-Locker method. Baseline T1 (s) increased in the stenotic kidney CO (2.10 [1.95-2.56] vs. 1.88 [1.81-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0317) and OSOM (2.17 [2.05-2.33] vs. 1.96 [1.87-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0075) but remained unchanged in ISOM and IM. This method allowed a temporal resolution of 1.43â€‰min in dynamic MEMRI. Mn2+ uptake and retention decreased in stenotic kidneys, particularly in the OSOM (Î”R1 : 0.48 [0.38-0.56] vs. 0.64 [0.61-0.69] s-1 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).


CONCLUSION

2109,"PURPOSE
In typical MRI protocols, time is spent acquiring a field map to calculate the shim settings for best image quality. We propose a fast template-based field map prediction method that yields near-optimal shims without measuring the field.


METHODS
The template-based prediction method uses prior knowledge of the B0 distribution in the human brain, based on a large database of field maps acquired from different subjects, together with subject-specific structural information from a quick localizer scan. The shimming performance of using the template-based prediction is evaluated in comparison to a range of potential fast shimming methods.


RESULTS
Static B0 shimming based on predicted field maps performed almost as well as shimming based on individually measured field maps. In experimental evaluations at 7â€‰T, the proposed approach yielded a residual field standard deviation in the brain of on average 59â€‰Hz, compared with 50â€‰Hz using measured field maps and 176â€‰Hz using no subject-specific shim.


CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that shimming based on predicted field maps is feasible. The field map prediction accuracy could potentially be further improved by generating the template from a subset of subjects, based on parameters such as head rotation and body mass index.

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.


OBJECTIVES
Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.


METHODS
Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: ""tremor"", ""tremor disorders"", ""essential tremor"", ""dystonic tremor"", and ""classification"" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.


RESULTS
Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2.

Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes.


METHODS
Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite scores.


RESULTS
Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.03 units/year, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003); this difference was comparable with 8â€‰years of aging. However, being in the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal (pâ€‰=â€‰0.71) or global score (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory decline (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.01 units/year, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.002; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive function-attention decline.


CONCLUSIONS
A variable pattern of depressive symptom severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern related to decline in executive function-attention. Findings could signal differences in underlying neuropathologic processes among persons with differing depression patterns and late-life cognitive decline.

2112,"CONTEXT
Medical educators often have prior and primary experience in other academic and clinical disciplines. Individuals seeking successful careers in the education of medical students and doctors must, at some point in their development, make a conscious transition into a new identity as a medical educator. This is a necessary move if individuals are to commit to acquiring and maintaining specialist expertise in medical education. Some achieve this transition successfully, whereas others struggle and may even lose interest and abandon the endeavour. We explored senior educators' experiences of achieving the transition into medical education and their views on what helps and what hinders the process.


METHODS
In 2015 we conducted three focus groups with 15 senior medical educators. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied transition theory to guide our deductive analysis, using Schlossberg's Four S (4S) framework to code and report participants' self-reported perceptions of those factors relating to Self, Situation, Support and Strategy that had assisted them to make a successful transition to a fully acknowledged medical educator identity. Through inductive analysis, we then identified 17 explanatory sub-themes common to all three focus groups.


RESULTS
Background and circumstances, individual motivation, a sense of control, organisational support, and effective networking and information-seeking behaviour were factors identified as contributing to successful transition into, and maintenance of, a strong self-identity as a medical educator.


CONCLUSIONS
The experiences of established medical educators and, in particular, an exploration of the factors that have facilitated their transition to an acknowledged self-identity as a medical educator could assist in supporting new educators to cope with the changes involved in developing as a medical educator.",England,Medical education,29193365,2017,Making the leap to medical education: a qualitative study of medical educators' experiences.,y

To describe what and why nurses self-disclose to patients in mental health care.


BACKGROUND
Self-disclosure is common, but controversial and difficult to delineate. Extant research suggests that self-disclosure might have several potentially beneficial effects on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome for patients in mental health care, but results are often mixed and limited by definitional inconsistencies.


METHOD
Qualitative descriptive study including data from 16 nurses taking part in participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews.


RESULTS
Separate analyses resulted in four themes addressing the research question of what nurses self-disclose, and one main theme and four subthemes addressing why nurses self-disclose. The content of self-disclosure was captured in the four themes: Immediate family, Interests and activities, Life experiences, and Identity. In addition, results showed that disclosures were common among the nurses. Self-disclosure's potential to transform the nurse-patient relationship, making it more open, honest, close, reciprocal and equal, was the overarching reason why nurses shared personal information. The nurses also chose to self-disclose to share existential and everyday sentiments, to give real-life advice, because it felt natural and responsive to patients' question to do so.


CONCLUSION
Nurse self-disclosure is common and covers a variety of personal information. Nurses have several reasons for choosing to self-disclose, most of which are connected to improving the nurse-patient relationship.

To evaluate the effects of the implementation of a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings.


BACKGROUND
Care in long-term residential settings for older people is moving away from the biomedical approach and adopting a more person-centred one. Narrative can help shape the way care is planned and organised. The provision of person-centred care that is holistic and that takes account of resident's beliefs and values can be enhanced by incorporating narrative approaches to care within a practice development framework.


DESIGN
The chosen methodology was participatory action research.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2014, a methodological framework of narrative practice was implemented in two residential care settings, comprising 37 residents and 38 staff, using an action research approach. Three action cycles: (i) narrative practice and culture identification, (ii) developing narrative practice and (iii) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation.


RESULTS
Key outcomes emerged in relation to the findings. These were based on narrative being, knowing and doing and centred around the key outcomes of: (i) how people responded to change (narrative being), (ii) the development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and (iii) intentional action (narrative doing).


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a framework of narrative practice demonstrated that how people respond to change, the development of shared understandings and intentional action were interrelated and interlinked. It illustrated the importance of ensuring that practice context is taken account of in the implementation of action research and the importance of ensuring that narrative being, knowing and doing are clear and understandable for change to occur.

The two smaller groups represented different types of poly-victimization-a non-parental and a long-term parental victimization group.

In England and Wales, 'approved premises' offer 24-hour staffed accommodation for high-risk offenders, most of whom are returning to the community from prison. With a move towards a standardised operating model, it is essential to be able to measure outcomes.


AIMS
Our aim is to collate and evaluate 'benchmarks' for approved premises.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to establish the impact of existing practice in all four approved premises in Wales. Data on well-being, life satisfaction, attitudes to violence and problem-solving abilities were recorded with 114 male residents (of 486), and attitudes to personality disorder and personal well-being/burnout with 30 staff (of 86), in both narrative style and according to a number of scales used within criminal justice and healthcare systems. Perceptions of environmental climate were assessed with both groups. Scores were compared with those from reference groups, including prisoners and secure hospital patients. Criminological outcomes (e.g. prison recall) were obtained for all 486 men.


RESULTS
Scores on the scales used were broadly comparable with those in relevant reference groups, but some showed floor or ceiling effects. Recall rates, whether directly from the premises or after further onward movement, were about 42% overall, comparable with those reported for similar offenders elsewhere.

2118,"The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.",England,Journal of sleep research,29193443,2017,A review of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with anxiety.,y
2119,"A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16Â years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents. Key Practitioner Message The adoption status (but not attachment representations) was found to be predictive of externalizing and total behaviour problems, suggesting that attachment itself is not the only variable to take into account in explaining possible maladaptive outcomes in late-adopted adolescents. Nevertheless, disorganized attachment positively predicted internalizing problems, being a risk factor for both adopted and nonadopted adolescents. Only for late-adopted adolescents, higher cognitive reappraisal was negatively related with externalizing problems, suggesting that the functional and positive ability to cognitively restructure negative situations may help them to reduce impulsive negative reactions towards others. Both increasing cognitive reappraisal and decreasing expressive suppression may be considered as valuable goals of therapy with adopted adolescents and their parents. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadopted peers, reported lower somatic complaints, suggesting that they may not allow themselves to show physical vulnerability as consequence of their early affective experiences of severe deprivation. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadoptedÂ ones, reported higher level of expressive suppression strategies, which may be considered as an attempt to beÂ compliant with the environment's requests in order to be loved, accepted, and nurtured.",England,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,29193445,2017,Late-adoptions in adolescence: Can attachment and emotion regulation influence behaviour problems?

OSA was diagnosed and categorized based on a standard respiratory polygraphic sleep study using a type 3 portable monitor.

Cb treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, brain edema, neurodegeneration, and BBB impairment. Meanwhile, Cb treatment also significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins (occludin and zonula occluden-1), p-Akt and Bcl-2, but decreased expression of Bax. Moreover, Cb treatment exhibited more prominent effects on decreasing the levels of plasma d-lactate and colonic IL-6, upregulating expression of Occludin, and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, Cb-treatedÂ mice showed increased the secretion of intestinal GLP-1 and upregulated expression of cerebral GLP-1R.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Cb in TBI mice and the involved mechanisms were partially attributed to the elevating GLP-1 secretion through the gut-brain axis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193450,2017,Clostridium butyricum exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury via the gut-brain axis.,y
2122,"In the retina, MÃ¼ller glia have the potential to become progenitor cells with the ability to proliferate and regenerate neurons. However, the ability of MÃ¼ller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) to proliferate and produce neurons is limited in higher vertebrates. Using the chick model system, we investigate how retinoic acid (RA)-signaling influences the proliferation and the formation of MGPCs. We observed an upregulation of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) in the MÃ¼ller glia of damaged retinas where the formation of MGPCs is known to occur. Activation of RA-signaling was stimulated, whereas inhibition suppressed the proliferation of MGPCs in damaged retinas and in fibroblast growth factor 2-treated undamaged retinas. Furthermore, inhibition of RA-degradation stimulated the proliferation of MGPCs. Levels of Pax6, Klf4, and cFos were upregulated in MGPCs by RA agonists and downregulated in MGPCs by RA antagonists. Activation of RA-signaling following MGPC proliferation increased the percentage of progeny that differentiated as neurons. Similarly, the combination of RA and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) significantly increased neurogenesis from retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ). In summary, RA-signaling stimulates the formation of proliferating MGPCs and enhances the neurogenic potential of MGPCs and stem cells in the CMZ.

2123,"OBJECTIVE
Validate the Parkinson's disease (PD) composite scale (PDCS).


METHODS
The study included One hundred ninety four PD patients in five countries. Investigators completed the following scales: PDCS, MDS-UPDRS, PDSS-2, MoCA, WOK-19, SEND-PD and CISI-PD. For test-retest analysis, a second administration of the PDCS was carried out in 61 stable patients (as per the CISI-PD) in 7 to 14 days after the first evaluation. The PDCS is a novel scale for PD with a total of 17 items divided in 4 domains: motor, non-motor, treatment complication and disability.


RESULTS
PDCS mean and median values were close. Skewness values were into the criterion limits (-1 to +1). The complete range of scores was covered for 14 of the 17 items (83.4%). Floor effect of 25.26% and 28.25% were observed in the Complication and Disability level dimensions due to the proportion of patients free of these difficulties. No relevant floor or ceiling effect was observed for the PDCS Total Score (1.03% and 0.52%, respectively). The stability of the scale appeared excellent with most items meeting weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.80. The convergent validity of the PDCS with corresponding scores of the MDS-UPDRS showed high correlation values (rS â‰¥0.60). The internal validity was into acceptable limits, with the majority of values higher than the minimal 0.30 threshold. The standard error of measurement suggested a satisfactory precision (SEM=3.81, <30% of the PDCS total score standard deviation).

The PDCS appears to be a feasible, acceptable, reproducible and valid scale. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",England,European journal of neurology,29193455,2017,The Parkinson's Disease Composite Scale: Results of the first validation study.,y
2124,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. The phenotypic expression of the disease may, in part, relate to alterations in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. This resting-state study sought to clarify this in DLB, how networks differed from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether they were related to clinical symptoms in DLB. Resting-state networks were estimated using independent component analysis. We investigated functional connectivity changes in 31 DLB patients compared to 31 healthy controls and a disease comparator group of 29 AD patients using dual regression and FSLNets. Within-network connectivity was generally decreased in DLB compared to controls, mainly in motor, temporal, and frontal networks. Between-network connectivity was mainly intact; only the connection between a frontal and a temporal network showed increased connectivity in DLB. Differences between AD and DLB were subtle and we did not find any significant correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms in DLB. This study emphasizes the importance of reduced connectivity within motor, frontal, and temporal networks in DLB with relative sparing of the default mode network. The lack of significant correlations between connectivity measures and clinical scores indicates that the observed reduced connectivity within these networks might be related to the presence, but not to the severity of motor and cognitive impairment in DLB patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that AD and DLB may show more similarities than differences in patients with mild disease.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193464,2017,Functional connectivity in dementia with Lewy bodies: A within- and between-network analysis.,y

In Experiment 1, 5- and 6-year-old children consumed more of a food described as popular with other children than a food that was described as unpopular with other children, even though the two foods were identical. In Experiment 2, children ate more of a food described as popular with children than a food described as popular with adults. Experiment 3 tested whether different perceptual experiences of otherwise identical foods contributed to the mechanisms underlying children's consumption. After sampling both endpoints of a sweet-to-sour range (applesauce with 0 mL or 5mL of lemon juice added), children were asked to taste and categorize applesauce samples with varying amounts of lemon juice added. When classifying ambiguous samples that were near the midpoint of the range (2 mL and 3 mL), children were more likely to categorize popular foods as sweet as compared to unpopular foods. Together, these findings provide evidence that social information plays a powerful role in guiding children's consumption and perception of foods.

To investigate the feasibility of a 13-week mentoring program in providing social support to promote hope for recovery in anorexia nervosa.


BACKGROUND
With no clear first line psychological treatment for people with anorexia nervosa, mentoring support programs, as an adjunct to treatment, may provide the social support necessary to promote hope for recovery.


DESIGN
A mixed method study; Participatory action research.


METHODS
Women (n=11), recovering and who had recovered from anorexia nervosa, participated in the program and completed self-report questionnaires related to quality of life, distress and the mentoring relationship at different time points. Qualitative feedback from logbooks, workshop evaluation questionnaires, interviews and focus groups was also collected to assess the program's acceptability.


RESULTS
General compliance for completing most study outcome questionnaires was 90% however the mentoring relationship questionnaires were not completed to the same degree. Five key themes emerged from the focus group/interview data: 1) She understands me and could relate to me; 2) Re-connecting with the world - Asking questions and being challenged; 3) Mentors' altruistic motivations and the transformation and discovery of self; 4) Instilling hope - Recovery is possible; and 5) Effective communication - The key to successful mentoring.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is needed however the results provide preliminary support for the mentoring program's feasibility as an adjunct to treatment. We found that having someone who understands, to talk and share with, met a clear need for people with anorexia nervosa.

2127,"Stroke patients with motor deficits typically feature enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, also healthy subjects may show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with higher motor demands. Therefore, the question arises to what extent stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural reorganization. We here investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1) but unlike in healthy controls also in contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of right SPL onto affected/left M1 in patients but not in controls when moving the affected/right hand independent of the movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of right SPL was positively coupled with the ""active"" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency. In summary, these findings are compatible with a supportive role of right SPL with respect to motor function of the paretic hand in the reorganized brain.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193484,2017,Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients.,y

In the era of neurological subspecialization, most neurologists will have a field of specialist interest. The aim of this cross-sectional multi-national study was to identify the key areas of interest among trainees or junior specialists, assess the potential influence of an interest in research, and consider the results in light of population needs.


METHODS
A total of 300 residents and junior neurologists who received a bursary to attend the European Academy of Neurology conference were invited to participate in this study. Demographic and work-related characteristics, as well as main subspecialty of choice were examined via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Participants holding a higher degree (PhD/MD) or working in research posts were considered research oriented.


RESULTS
In total, 191 Neurologists in training or junior specialists responded (response rate 63.7%). Full data were available for 187 participants (59.4% females). The study sample had a mean age of 30.5Â±3.4 years (range 25 - 45). The most popular subspecialty was movement disorders (18.2%), followed by multiple sclerosis (11.2%) and epilepsy (10.2%). This did not differ significantly between the participants who were or were not research-oriented.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a potential mismatch between the interests of trainees, and the future needs of the populations they serve, which it is important to identify for workforce planning.

No studies have focused on socioeconomic disparities in obesity within and between cohorts. Our objectives were to examine income gradients in obesity between birth-cohorts (inter-cohort variations) and within each birth-cohort (intra-cohort variations) by gender and race/ethnicity.


METHODS
Our sample includes 56,820 white and black adults from pooled, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1971-2012). We fit a series of logistic hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models to control for the effects of age and period, simultaneously. Predicted probabilities of obesity by poverty-to-income ratio were estimated and graphed for 5-year cohort groups from 1901-1990. We also stratified this relationship for four gender and racial/ethnic subgroups.


RESULTS
Obesity disparities due to income were weaker for post-World War I and II generations, specifically the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s to 1950s cohorts, than for other cohorts. In contrast, we found greater income gradients in obesity among cohorts from the 1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to 1970s. Moreover, obesity disparities due to income across cohorts vary markedly by gender and race/ethnicity. White women with higher income consistently exhibited a lower likelihood of obesity than those with lower income since early 1900s cohorts; whereas, black men with higher income exhibited higher risks of obesity than those with lower income in most cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that strategies that address race and/or gender inequalities in obesity should be cognizant of significant historical factors that may be unique to cohorts. Period-based approaches that ignore life-course experiences captured in significant cohort-based experiences may limit the utility of policies and interventions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193504,2017,Cohort-based income gradients in obesity among U.S. adults.,y
2131,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
This study proposed and tested a structural model to explain and predict family empowerment in families of children with special needs.


BACKGROUND
Family empowerment of families of children with special needs can be explained using the Double ABCX model. Although constant stressors such as parenting stress and family demands can have negative effects on family empowerment, family resources and parenting efficacy can mediate the negative effect through effective coping strategies.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional research design was employed.


METHODS
A survey was conducted with 240 parents of children with special needs. Upon exclusion of 4 responses deemed inadequate to the statistics process, 236 responses were selected for the analysis. Based on the items used in the previous research, we used the scale of family demands 38, the scale of parenting stress 24, the scale of parenting efficacy 37, the scale of pattern of organization 30, the scale of communication process 16, and the scale of family empowerment 32.


RESULTS
In families of children with special needs, parenting stress had a negative effect on parenting efficacy and family resources, namely, pattern of organization and communication process. Family needs had a positive effect on parenting efficacy. Parenting stress and family demands influenced family empowerment through parenting efficacy and family resources (pattern of organization and communication process), while parenting efficacy contributed to family empowerment.


CONCLUSIONS
This study empirically analyzed the usefulness of the Double ABCX model in predicting family empowerment. Family resource factors (organization pattern and communication process) and perception or judgement factors (such as parenting efficacy) were found to mediate the negative impact of various stressors experienced by families of children with special needs.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study findings suggest that clinical practice and management should focus on providing efficient intervention methods to lower stress in families of children with special needs. Reinforcing factors contributing to family empowerment, such as parenting efficacy, organization pattern, and communication process will alleviate families' stress, resulting in a positive educational and developmental impact on children with special needs.

2132,"Neurogenesis encompasses an entire set of events that leads to the generation of newborn neurons from neural stem cells and more committed progenitor cells, including cell division, the production of migratory precursors and their progeny, differentiation and integration into circuits. In particular, the precise control of neuronal migration and morphological changes is essential for the development of the neocortex. Postmitotic cells within the intermediate zone have been found to transiently assume a characteristic ""multipolar"" morphology, after which a multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs before the cells enter the cortical plate; however, the importance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical cytoarchitecture and the precise genetic control of this phase remains largely unknown. Thus, this review article focuses on the multipolar phase in the developing neocortex. It begins by summarizing the molecular mechanism that underlies multipolar migration for the regulation of each step in multipolar phase in intermediate zone. The physiological significance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical lamination and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with migration defects is then described.",England,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,29193520,2017,Physiological significance of multipolar cells generated from neural stem cells and progenitors for the establishment of neocortical cytoarchitecture.,y

To analyze whether living conditions, experienced by mothers and adult daughters during their childhood, are associated with age at menarche (AAM) in daughters.


METHODS
From September, 2011, to January, 2014, AAM and childhood living conditions were collected from a sample of 246 dyads of Maya mothers (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰59.60 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.64) and their adult daughters (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰33.03 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰5.57) from the cities of Merida and Motul in Yucatan, Mexico. Indicators of childhood living conditions were number of siblings and quality of house construction materials in both generations, and father's absence among daughters in their pre-menarcheal years. Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between childhood conditions in mother-daughter dyads and daughter's AAM.


RESULTS
The recalled mean AAM of adult Maya daughters was 12.05 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.53). After adjusting for the influence of mothers' AAM, number of siblings in both the mothers' and daughters' families directly predicted daughters' AAM (more siblings was associated with a later AAM); and a higher (better) index of household conditions in mothers' childhood was associated with earlier AAM in daughters. The household conditions index during the childhood of daughters and father's absence were not associated with their AAM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that better living conditions experienced by the mothers and daughters during their childhood may lower mean AAM in daughters in the context of populations that show important intergenerational changes in their social and economic conditions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193533,2017,"Living conditions and change in age of menarche in adult Maya mothers and daughters from Yucatan, Mexico.",y
2134,"Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, 'boom-and-bust' demography, hybridization, and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure, and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation, and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C. santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C. santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker, and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses' perspectives of language barriers and their impact on the provision of care to patients with limited English proficiency from diverse linguistic background.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Using individual interviews and focus group discussions, data were collected from 59 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals in England. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.


FINDINGS
Three themes: 'multi-ethnicities and language barriers'; 'the impact of language barriers'; and 'communicating via interpreters', were identified. Communication was identified as the most important aspect of care provision and an essential component of a nurse's professional role regardless of the clinical area or speciality. Language barriers were identified as the biggest obstacles in providing adequate, appropriate, effective and timely care to patients with limited English proficiency. Use of professional interpreters was considered useful; however, the limitations associated with use of interpretation service, including arrangement difficulties, availability and accessibility of interpreters, convenience, confidentiality and privacy related issues and impact on the patient's comfort were mentioned.


CONCLUSION
Language barriers, in any country or setting, can negatively affect nurses' ability to communicate effectively with their patients and thereby have a negative impact on the provision of appropriate, timely, safe and effective care to meet patient's needs.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
An understanding of language barriers can help nurses find appropriate strategies to overcome such barriers and, consequently, enhance the provision of effective care to patients affected by language barriers in any clinical setting in any health care system.

This study reports on the committee's ability to achieve these goals.


PROCEDURE
An online survey was sent to YIs who were registered with the program from 2004 to2015, assessing three major domains: (1) overall experience with the mentor pairing, (2) satisfaction with the program, and (3) academic accomplishments of the mentees.


RESULTS
The response rate was 64% (110/171). Overall, YIs rated the success of their mentorship pairing as 7.2 out of 10 (median) (25th, 75th quartile 3.6, 9.6). The direct effects of the mentorship program included 70% YIs reporting a positive effect on their career, 40% reporting any grant or manuscript resulting from the pairing, 47% forming a new research collaboration, and 43% receiving appointment to a COG committee. Respondents reported success in COG with 38% authoring a manuscript on behalf of COG and 65% reporting a leadership position including seven current or past COG discipline chairs and 20 study chairs.

A method of real-time, accurate probe tracking at the entrance of the MRI bore is developed, which, fused with pre-procedural MR images, will enable clinicians to perform cryoablation efficiently in a large workspace with image guidance.


METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) tracking coupled with optical tracking is used to track the probe. EM tracking is achieved with an MRI-safe EM sensor working under the scanner's magnetic field to compensate the line-of-sight issue of optical tracking. Unscented Kalman filter-based probe tracking is developed to smooth the EM sensor measurements when occlusion occurs and to improve the tracking accuracy by fusing the measurements of two sensors.


RESULTS
Experiments with a spine phantom show that the mean targeting errors using the EM sensor alone and using the proposed method are 2.21Â mm and 1.80Â mm, respectively.

To describe sleep patterns in young children with epilepsy and to examine levels of agreement between measurements derived from actigraphy and diary recordings.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHODS
Eighty-nine toddlers and preschool-aged children with epilepsy wore an actigraph on their wrists for 7 consecutive days. Parents and caregivers maintained a concurrent sleep diary while the child was wearing the monitor. Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends.


FINDINGS
Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were Â±35, Â±15, Â±82, Â±70, and Â±29 min, respectively. Differences between actigraphy and diary-derived sleep variables were consistently greater for weekends than for weekdays. Discrepancies between actigraphy and diary-derived actual sleep at night were significantly greater for children who slept alone than for those who co-slept with a parent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates an acceptable agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings for sleep onset, sleep offset, and daytime sleep, but insufficient agreement for actual sleep at night and wake after sleep onset, with parents of children sleeping alone more likely to misestimate child sleep behaviors. Deviation of weekend sleep from weekdays further decreased the accuracy of parental sleep estimates and increased the discrepancies between actigraphy and diary.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on brain magnetic resonance imaging, represent an abnormality related to the development of geriatric syndromes. Recently, it has been found that low sympathetic nervous activity might be associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the severity of cerebral WMH and sympathetic nervous activity, measured by the heart rate variability.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 39 older patients. Holter recording was carried out for 30 min. From the RR intervals on the electrocardiogram, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals, the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in all the five segments of the entire recording, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF were calculated. In regard to the WMH, periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The WMH were also rated semiquantitatively according to the methods developed by Junque (periventricular hyperintensities) and de Groot (DWMH).


RESULTS
The LF/HF showed significant negative correlations with the total and regional periventricular hyperintensities, as well as DWMH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the negative associations remained significant between the LF/HF and DWMH (total, temporal, occipital). Furthermore, fall risk index significantly correlated with the LF/HF, total and the occipital DWMH.


CONCLUSIONS
The severity of the DWMH was associated with the LF/HF and the fall risk, one of the important geriatric syndromes, suggesting that WMH, sympathetic nervous dysfunction and geriatric syndrome are interrelated to each other.

2143,"PURPOSE
Displacement is traumatic and often an unwanted social change that can lead to a loss of identity and socioeconomic, physical, and psychological livelihood. The purpose of the study was to describe the association of perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness to depressive symptom severity in Palestinian refugees, taking into consideration gender and poverty.


DESIGN
The descriptive, correlational study was framed within a socioecological lens. Data collection occurred between October 2015 and November 2015 in Amman, Jordan, which hosts the most Palestinian refugees in the world. The participants in the sample (N = 177) had a mean age of 36.9 years.


METHODS
Participants responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptom severity, the RAND-36 perceived health item, and a statement about hopefulness to return to Palestine. Descriptive, correlation, and logistic and linear regression analyses were computed.


FINDINGS
Results showed that 43% of participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 42% lived in poverty, and 20% had fair or poor health; yet, 60% were hopeful about returning to Palestine. Participants who had better perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness were less likely to have symptoms of major depression. Perceived health was the only factor-not gender, poverty, or right-of-return hopefulness-that explained the variance in depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Palestinian adult refugees in Jordan exhibited symptoms of major depression that were associated with poorer perceived health and less hopefulness about repatriation to Palestine.

Mental health nursing is a concept that has lost any real explanatory or conceptual power, yet nevertheless persists in public discourse and the collective imagination. In recent decades, powerful forces have contributed to the zombification of the mental health nursing workforce and the academy. An increase in medical hegemony, the ascendancy of allied health in mental health service provision, the need for uncritical and servile workers, protocol-driven work practices, and a failure of leadership to mobilize any substantial resistance to these trends have enabled the infection to spread.

Many older adults face limitations to participating in active leisure activities as a result of their physical constraints from aging. Passive leisure activities become alternative leisure activities for older adults as a result of limited physical capacity. The present study sought to determine whether there exists a difference in the frequency of participation in passive and active leisure activities, and the effect of participation in passive and active leisure activities on the life satisfaction level of old adults.


METHODS
A total of 460 participants aged 60-95â€‰years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index - Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities.


RESULTS
The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), homemaking/maintenance (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and traveling (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index - Z for older adults.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates.

Little is known about the role of PRS in densely affected multigenerational families. We tested PRS differences between affected SZ and BD family members from their non-affected adult relatives (NAARs) in Eastern Quebec Kindreds and from controls. We examined 1227 subjects: from 17 SZ and BD kindreds, we studied 153 patients (57 SZ, 13 schizoaffective, and 83 BD) and 180 NAARs, and 894 unrelated controls from the Eastern Quebec population. PRS were derived from published case-control association studies of SZ and BD. We also constructed a combined SZ and BD PRS by using SNPs from both SZ and BD PRS. SZ patients had higher SZ PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0039, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027) and BD patients had higher BD PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027).

Dietary cholesterol has been shown to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed that oxysterol especially 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) may play a potential role in Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) production and accumulation during AD progression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To investigate the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol and 27-OHC on learning and memory impairment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with cholesterol diet with or without 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole) injection. We determined the levels of cholesterol, 27-OHC, 24S-OHC, 7Î±-OHC and 7Î²-OHC in plasma; ApoA, ApoB, HDL-C and LDL-C in plasma or brain; CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in liver and CYP46A1 and CYP7B1 in brain; cathepsin B, cathepsin D and acid phosphatase in lysosome; AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 in brain. Results showed increased levels of 27-OHC (PÂ <Â 0.01), LDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.01), ApoB (PÂ <Â 0.01) and decreased level of HDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.05) in plasma, upregulated CYP27A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) and CYP7A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) expression in liver, altered lysosomal function and increased level of AÎ² in brain (PÂ <Â 0.05).

2148,"Recent studies showed cultural worldviews are a key determinant of environmental risk perceptions; thus, they could influence climate change adaptation strategies. African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45 % of agro-pastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a compliment to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation.

Strengthening neighborhood social networks is important for promoting health among older adults. However, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing older adults' social networks have not yet been established. The present study examined whether a university-led community intervention that provided communication opportunities could increase older Japanese adults' neighborhood social networks.


METHODS
The present study used a quasi-experimental design. Before the intervention, using postal mail, we carried out a baseline questionnaire survey that was sent to all people living in the Tsurukabuto community aged â‰¥60â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰1769), of whom 1068 responded. For the community intervention, 18 event-based programs were provided over the course of 1â€‰year at Kobe University. Academic staff at Kobe University organized all the programs. During the program, social interactions among participants were promoted. A follow-up survey was distributed to those who responded to the baseline survey, and 710 individuals answered the question about their participation in the intervention programs (138 respondents were participants, 572 were non-participants). The neighborhood social network was measured in both the baseline and follow-up surveys.


RESULTS
Analysis of covariance showed that the changes in neighborhood social network among participants in the program was significantly higher than the changes among non-participants (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046) after adjusting for the baseline score of social network.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study found that participants of the intervention expanded their neighborhood social network, but non-participants did not.

2150,"Neural crest cells (NCC) can migrate into different parts of the body and express their strong inductive potential. In addition, they are multipotent and are able to differentiate into various cell types with diverse functions. In the primitive gut, NCC induce differentiation of muscular structures and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and they themselves differentiate into the elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), neurons and glial cells. ICC develop by way of mesenchymal cell differentiation in the outer parts of the primitive gut wall around the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia, with the exception of colon, where they appear simultaneously also at the submucosal border of the circular muscular layer around the submucosal plexus (SMP) ganglia. However, in a complex process of reciprocal induction of NCC and local mesenchyma, c-kit positive precursors are the first to differentiate, representing probably the common precursors of ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). C-kit positive precursors could represent a key impact factor regarding the final differentiation of NCC into neurons and glial cells with neurons subsequently excreting stem cell factor (SCF) and other signalling molecules. Under the impact of SCF, a portion of c-kit positive precursors lying immediately around the ganglia differentiate into ICC, while the rest differentiate into SMC.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193736,2017,Development of interstitial cells of Cajal in the human digestive tract as the result of reciprocal induction of mesenchymal and neural crest cells.,y
2151,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A.

2152,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multi-arm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of LGMs, how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model in order to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network. A publicly available R package, nmaINLA, is developed to automate the INLA implementation of NMA models which are considered in this paper.

2153,"Social communication impairments are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and this class of symptoms is a target for treatments for the disorder. Measures of social attention, assessed via eye-gaze tracking (EGT), have been proposed as an early efficacy biomarker for clinical trials targeting social communication skills. EGT measures have been shown to differentiate children with ASD from typical children; however, there is less known about their relationships with social communication outcome measures that are typically used in ASD clinical trials. In the present study, an EGT task involving viewing a videotape of an actor making bids for a child's attention was evaluated in 25 children with ASD aged 24-72 months. Children's attention to the actor during the dyadic bid condition measured via EGT was found to be strongly associated with five well-validated caregiver-reported outcome measures that are commonly used to assess social communication in clinical trials. These results highlight the convergent validity of EGT measures of social attention in relation to caregiver-reported clinical measures. EGT holds promise as a non-invasive, quantitative, and objective biomarker that is associated with social communication abilities in children with ASD. Autism Res 2017,.

2154,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in which reduced social interest is a common symptom, such as autism, depression, and anxiety, are frequently associated with genetic mutations affecting GABAergic transmission. Benzodiazepine treatment, acting via GABAA receptors, improves social interaction in male mouse models with autism-like features. The protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) can act as an endogenous benzodiazepine, but a role for DBI in social behavior has not been described. Here we investigated the role of DBI in the social interest and recognition behavior of mice. The responses of DBI wild-type and knockout male and female mice to ovariectomized female wild-type mice (a neutral social stimulus) were evaluated in a habituation/dishabituation task. Both male and female knockout mice exhibited reduced social interest, and DBI knockout mice lacked the sex difference in social interest levels observed in wild-type mice, in which males showed higher social interest levels than females. The ability to discriminate between familiar and novel stimulus mice (social recognition) was not impaired in DBI-deficient mice of either sex. DBI knockouts could learn a rotarod motor task, and could discriminate between social and non-social odors. Both sexes of DBI knockout mice showed increased repetitive grooming behavior, but not in a manner that would account for the decrease in social investigation time. Genetic loss of DBI did not alter seminal vesicle weight, indicating that the social interest phenotype of males lacking DBI is not due to reduced circulating testosterone. Together, these studies reveal a novel role of DBI in driving social interest and motivation.",England,"Genes, brain, and behavior",29193847,2017,Genetic loss of diazepam binding inhibitor in mice impairs social interest.,y

We thus here propose a complementary conceptual framework towards the development of an energy-oriented classification of cell properties, that is, a mitochondria-centrism hypothesis based on physical forces-driven principles. A literature review on the physical-biological interactions in a number of various biological processes is analysed from the point of view of the fluid and solid mechanics, electricity and thermodynamics. There is consistent evidence that physical forces control cell proliferation and differentiation.

Treatments that stimulate adenosine A2A receptors may represent a promising approach for reducing RRBs in ASD. This is because A2A receptors are expressed on striatal neurons of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Under activation of this pathway has been associated with RRBs while activation of A2A receptors leads to increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway. The present studies investigated whether acute, systemic treatment with CGS21680, an A2A receptor agonist attenuates elevated self-grooming and a probabilistic reversal learning deficit in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf /J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism. The effects of this treatment were also investigated in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as a comparison strain. Using a spatial reversal learning test with 80/20 probabilistic feedback, comparable to one in which ASD individuals exhibit deficits, CGS 21680 (0.005 and 0.01mg/kg) attenuated a reversal learning deficit in BTBR mice. Enhancement in probabilistic reversal learning performance resulted from CGS 21680 improving the consistent maintenance of new adaptive behavioral choice patterns after reversal. CGS 21680 at 0.01 mg, but not 0.005 mg, also reduced self-grooming behavior in BTBR mice. CGS 21680 did not affect self-grooming or reversal learning in B6 mice.

A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment. The authors have developed software through which students can experience the practice of psychiatry (in particular, with dementia patients) in its entirety. This study compares this software with conventional learning methods.


METHOD
The control group was 43 fifth-year medical students in 2014 who studied using a conventional learning method (taking lectures and being in contact with actual patients). The experimental group was 36 fifth-year medical students in 2015 that used computer software (taking lectures and with reduced time in contact with actual patients). The authors compared the two groups. Each group was tested before and after clinical training on their acquisition of knowledge of dementia. The control group was tested in 2014, and the experimental group was tested in 2015.


RESULTS
The difference in average test scores between the two groups was statistically significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), with the experimental group scoring higher.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that students who were taught using a computer-based software method were better able to answer a standard series of questions designed to evaluate their understanding of dementia than those who were taught in a conventional manner.

Today we realise that those qualities which were thought to belong specifically to human beings, such as awareness, reason, memory and free will, can disappear. Should we conclude then that those whose capacities have decreased or disappeared have become less human or have even lost all human qualities?Such questioning leads to new ways of describing humans whereby they would be defined not in substantial but rather in interpersonal terms.Surely being a person means first and foremost that we live through and for others.

Then a targeted subsample (i.e., the analysis sample, n = 1,730) completed a diagnostic interview to identify DSM-IV 30-day disorder. Weighted results represented the entire population ( N = 50,049). Both scales similarly showed a good ability to discriminate between personnel with and without depressive disorders. Optimal cutoffs (19 for K10, 6 for PHQ9) showed high sensitivity and good specificity, and were similar to though slightly lower than those recommended in civilian populations. Both scales appear to be valid screens for depressive disorder in the military, using the cutoffs identified. As both performed similarly, scale choice may depend on other factors (e.g., availability of norms).",United States,Assessment,29192508,2017,Screening for Depression and Psychological Distress in a Currently Serving Military Population: The Diagnostic Accuracy of the K10 and the PHQ9.,y
2166,"Engaging in enjoyable activities is an essential part of well-being, but people with dementia can find participation increasingly difficult. Motion-based technologies can provide meaningful engagement in a wide range of activities, but for people with dementia to take advantage of these devices requires a good understanding of how best to select and present these activities to this population. The objective of this study was to explore the use of motion-based technology (Xbox Kinect) as a group activity for people with dementia who attend adult day programmes. This qualitative study took place in an adult day programme for older adults with age-related challenges. Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰23) were observed while playing a digital bowling game presented on Xbox Kinect one hour per week for a period of 20 weeks, to capture naturalistic data. Field notes generated through observations were transcribed and analysed to identify emerging themes. The findings revealed three predominant themes which illustrate the potential of motion-based technology as a group activity for people with dementia who attend adult day programmes: (a) the importance of having a trained trainer, (b) learning versus mastery and (c) playing 'independently together'. People with dementia can learn to play games presented on motion-based technology and enjoy doing so. Furthermore, using the technology in a group setting fostered an encouraging and supportive environment which further contributed to the leisure experience. However, to be used most effectively, staff must be trained to set-up and interact with the technology, as well as introduce, teach and support people with dementia to use it.",England,"Dementia (London, England)",29192511,2017,The Kinect Project: Group motion-based gaming for people living with dementia.,y
2167,"Background Apathy is prominent in persons with dementia and apathy assessment is challenging. It remains unclear who should conduct apathy assessments in long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). Methods This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant, and one licensed practical nurse or activity staff. Family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff rated the resident's apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results The results revealed that ratings conducted by certified nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (râ€‰=â€‰0.47, pâ€‰=â€‰.08). None of the other AES ratings among family, certified nursing assistants, and licensed practical nurses/activity staff were significantly correlated. Discussion Family and clinical caregivers were incongruent on their AES ratings of apathy. It remains undetermined which rater provides the most valid AES rating for residents with dementia. Findings from this study further highlight challenges in rating apathy in this population.

2168,"The acute hospital admission of patients with dementia is associated with poor outcome and higher costs. Much of our knowledge on how hospital stays are experienced by patients and staff is generated from short and fragmented data collections, in which the significance of knowledge about day-to-day care might be overlooked, and might partly explain why the poor outcome for this group of patients is not fully understood. This study used participant observation to follow patients with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards after fall incidents. To gather longitudinal data, patients were followed during day and evening shifts, from admission to discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The data showed that, despite having little specific knowledge about dementia care, staff were able to gather information about the patient's needs and wishes relevant to administrating medicine in a person-centred way. However, much of this valuable information was lost between shifts or became hidden among the overwhelming amount of information in electronic patient records. As a consequence, much of the knowledge about individual patients' needs and wishes had to be collected all over again at every shift.

To analyze the impact of measures undertaken to control brucellosis in the Republic of Macedonia on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the disease in humans.


METHODS
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients with brucellosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated at the University Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje during three time periods: 1989-1990 when no national strategy for disease control existed, 2000-2001 when some activities for control were performed and 2011-2014 when an organized and financially supported strategy was accomplished.


RESULTS
A drastic decrease of the number of cases of human brucellosis during the last period when compared to the first two ones (3.9 and 3.3 times lower, respectively) was evident. Patients from the third period were significantly older, with median age 41 years (range 4-73) vs. 31 years (3-77) and 34 years (1-74), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰.013). There were more males (86.6 vs. 73.6% and 63.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and the disease was more often acquired professionally (80.6 vs. 60.1% and 59.2%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰.006).

2174,"BACKGROUND
Patients with brain lesions and resultant chronic aphasia frequently suffer from depression. However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits.


OBJECTIVE
The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial).


METHODS
In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test).


RESULTS
Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance.


CONCLUSIONS
Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.",United States,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,29192534,2017,Intensive Communicative Therapy Reduces Symptoms of Depression in Chronic Nonfluent Aphasia.,y
2175,"BACKGROUND
Patients with neglect ignore or respond slower to contralesional stimuli. Neglect negatively influences independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most frequently studied treatments, yet there is little evidence regarding positive effects on neglect behavior in ADL.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether PA in the subacute phase ameliorates neglect in situations of varying complexity.


METHODS
A total of 70 neglect patients admitted for inpatient stroke rehabilitation received either PA or sham adaptation (SA) for 2 weeks, with full access to standard treatment. There were 7 time-dependent measurements (baseline and 1-4, 6, and 14 weeks after start of treatment). The primary outcome was change of neglect as observed during basic ADL with the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in performance on a dynamic multitask (ie, the Mobility Assessment Course [MAC]) and a static paper-and-pencil task (ie, a shape cancellation task [SC]).


RESULTS
In all, 34 patients received PA and 35 SA. There were significant time-dependent improvements in performance as measured with the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F > 15.57; P < .001). There was no significant difference in magnitude of improvement between groups on the CBS, MAC, and SC (all F < 2.54; P > .113].


CONCLUSIONS
No beneficial effects of PA over SA in the subacute phase poststroke were observed, which was comparable for situations of varying complexity. Heterogeneity of the syndrome, time post-stroke onset, and the content of treatment as usual are discussed.

To examine changes in breastfeeding rates in 0 to 6 month old infants in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, over the period from 2009 to 2015, for the total population as well as for various ethnic groups.

METHOD
Breastfeeding rates were examined for the period from 2009 to 2015 in 165,420 registrations of 75,543 infants at the ages of 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months for the entire Amsterdam population and for various ethnic groups. Differences were analysed using Ï‡2 tests.


RESULTS
The weighted percentage of total breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding as well as a combination of breast and formula feeding) increased in the entire Amsterdam study population over the period from 2009 to 2015 (2 weeks: 87.8% to 89.1%; 3 months: 61.6% to 63.6%; 6 months: 39.5% to 42.2%). Increases were mainly the result of increases in weighted percentages for exclusive breastfeeding.

Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic influences on diurnal preference have exclusively included subjects of European ancestry. This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs. Genetic risk score (GRS) profiling detected shared genetic risk between evening preference and related disorders. Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012.

2184,"OBJECTIVE
Regenerated peripheral nervous tissue possesses different morphometric properties compared to undisrupted nerve. It is poorly understood how these morphometric differences alter the response of the regenerated nerve to electrical stimulation. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the electrophysiological response of regenerated and undisrupted nerve axons to electrical stimulation delivered by macro-sieve electrodes (MSEs).


APPROACH
A 3D finite element model of a peripheral nerve segment populated with mammalian myelinated axons and implanted with a macro-sieve electrode has been developed. Fiber diameters and morphometric characteristics representative of undisrupted or regenerated peripheral nervous tissue were assigned to core conductor models to simulate the two tissue types. Simulations were carried out to quantify differences in thresholds and chronaxie between undisrupted and regenerated fiber populations. The model was also used to determine the influence of axonal caliber on recruitment thresholds for the two tissue types. Model accuracy was assessed through comparisons with in-vivo recruitment data from chronically implanted MSEs.


MAIN RESULTS
Recruitment thresholds of individual regenerated fibers with diameters &gt;2 Âµm were found to be lower compared to same caliber undisrupted fibers at electrode to fiber distances of less than about 90-140 Âµm but roughly equal or higher for larger distances. Caliber redistributions observed in regenerated nerve resulted in an overall increase in average recruitment thresholds and chronaxie during whole nerve stimulation. Modeling results also suggest that large diameter undisrupted fibers located close to a longitudinally restricted current source such as the MSE have higher average recruitment thresholds compared to small diameter fibers. In contrast, large diameter regenerated nerve fibers located in close proximity of MSE sites have, on average, lower recruitment thresholds compared to small fibers. Utilizing regenerated fiber morphometry and caliber distributions resulted in accurate predictions of in-vivo recruitment data.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our work uses computational modeling to show how morphometric differences between regenerated and undisrupted tissue results in recruitment threshold discrepancies, quantifies these differences, and illustrates how large undisrupted nerve fibers close to longitudinally restricted current sources have higher recruitment thresholds compared to adjacently positioned smaller fibers while the opposite is true for large regenerated fibers.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192607,2017,Modelling the impact of altered axonal morphometry on the response of regenerative nervous tissue to electrical stimulation through macro-sieve electrodes.,y
2185,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this work is to improve the state of the art for motor-control with a brain-machine interface (BMI). BMIs use neurological recording devices and a decoding algorithms to transform brain activity directly into real-time control of a machine, archetypically a robotic arm or a cursor. The standard procedure treats neural activity--vectors of spike counts in small temporal windows--as noisy observations of the kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration) of the fingertip. Inferring the state from the observations then takes the form of a \emph{dynamical filter}, typically some variant on Kalman's (KF). The KF, however, although fairly robust in practice, is optimal only when the relationships between variables are linear and the noise is Gaussian, conditions usually violated in practice.


APPROACH
To overcome these limitations we introduce a new filter, the ""recurrent exponential-family harmonium"" (rEFH), that models the spike counts explicitly as Poisson-distributed, and allows for arbitrary nonlinear dynamics and observation models. Furthermore, the model underlying the filter is acquired through unsupervised learning, which allows temporal correlations in spike counts to be explained by latent dynamics that do not necessarily correspond to the kinematic state of the fingertip.


MAIN RESULTS
We test the rEFH on offline reconstruction of the kinematics of reaches in the plane. The rEFH outperforms the standard, as well as three other state-of-the-art, decoders, across three monkeys, two different tasks, most kinematic variables, and a range of bin widths, amounts of training data, and numbers of neurons.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our algorithm establishes a new state of the art for offline decoding of reaches---in particular, for fingertip velocities, the variable used for control in most online decoders.&#13.",England,Journal of neural engineering,29192609,2017,"Superior arm-movement decoding from cortex with a new, unsupervised-learning algorithm.",y

This study examines the use of the number of night-time sleep disturbances as a health-based metric to assess the cost effectiveness of rail noise mitigation strategies for situations, wherein high-intensity noises dominate such as freight train pass-bys and wheel squeal.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty residential properties adjacent to the existing and proposed rail tracks in a noise catchment area of the Epping to Thornleigh Third Track project were used as a case study. Awakening probabilities were calculated for individual's awakening 1, 3 and 5 times a night when subjected to 10 independent freight train pass-by noise events using internal maximum sound pressure levels (LAFmax).


RESULTS
Awakenings were predicted using a random intercept multivariate logistic regression model. With source mitigation in place, the majority of the residents were still predicted to be awoken at least once per night (median 88.0%), although substantial reductions in the median probabilities of awakening three and five times per night from 50.9 to 29.4% and 9.2 to 2.7%, respectively, were predicted. This resulted in a cost-effective estimate of 7.6-8.8 less people being awoken at least three times per night per A$1 million spent on noise barriers.


CONCLUSION
The study demonstrates that an easily understood metric can be readily used to assist making decisions related to noise mitigation for large-scale transport projects.",India,Noise & health,29192613,2017,A Health-Based Metric for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Noise Barrier Mitigation Associated With Transport Infrastructure Noise.,y
2188,"CONTEXT
According to the attention restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors.


AIMS
By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50-min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40â€‰min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were re-tested. The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately re-tested. The difference between the two test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents the attention restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED
An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig.â€‰=â€‰0.027 (<0.050)].


RESULTS
The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95%) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8.4), 'traffic sounds group' (2.4) and 'machine sounds group' (-1.8).

It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, have a positive effect on the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration.",India,Noise & health,29192615,2017,Effects of Soundscape on the Environmental Restoration in Urban Natural Environments.,y

Hyperacusis is defined as a reduction in tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Hyperacusis can occur in individuals of all age groups, making daily life difficult for the sufferers. Although there is no objective test to accurately diagnose hyperacusis, questionnaires are useful for the assessment of hyperacusis. The aim of this study was to explore the reduced sound tolerance in university students using a hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 536 university students (300 females and 236 males) aged between 18 and 25 years, with a mean age of 21.34â€‰Â±â€‰1.87 years, were assessed using an HQ developed by Khalfa. The mean total score of all the participants was 16.34â€‰Â±â€‰7.91, and 5.78% of the participants had total scores indicating hyperacusis, where a majority of them were females.


RESULTS
Females had significantly higher scores than men in terms of both the total and the attentional and emotional dimensions. The scores of the participants who reported noise exposure or a decrease in their tolerance to noise were significantly higher than those of the other participants. Even among young adults, there was a group of participants suffering from some problems related to decreased tolerance to everyday sounds.


DISCUSSION
Although the Turkish translation of the HQ seems to be a reliable tool for evaluating hyperacusis in young adults, further work with various populations of different age groups is required to establish validity and to assess the psychometric qualities of the Turkish form.",India,Noise & health,29192616,2017,Assessment of Reduced Tolerance to Sound (Hyperacusis) in University Students.,y
2190,"OBJECTIVE
Children's own ratings and opinions on their schools sound environments add important information on noise sources. They can also provide information on how to further improve and optimize children's learning situation in their classrooms. This study reports on the Swedish translation and application of an evidence-based questionnaire that measures how children perceive the acoustic environment of their school.


STUDY DESIGN
The Swedish version was made using a back-to-back translation. Responses on the questionnaire along with demographic data were collected for 149 children aged 9-13 years of age.


RESULTS
The Swedish translation of the questionnaire can be reduced from 93 to 27 items. The 27 items were distributed over five separate factors measuring different underlying constructs with high internal consistency and high inter-item correlations. The responses demonstrated that the dining hall/canteen and the corridors are the school spaces with the poorest listening conditions. The highest annoyance was reported for tests and reading; next, student-generated sounds occur more frequently within the classroom than any sudden unexpected sounds, and finally, road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms are the most frequently occurring sounds from outside the classroom. Several demographic characteristics could be used to predict the outcome on these factors.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that crowded spaces are most challenging; the children themselves generate most of the noise inside the classroom, but it is also common to hear road traffic noise and teachers in adjoining classrooms. The extent of annoyance that noise causes depends on the task but seems most detrimental in tasks, wherein the demands of verbal processing are higher. Finally, children with special support seem to report that they are more susceptible to noise than the typical child.",India,Noise & health,29192618,2017,How Children Perceive the Acoustic Environment of Their School.,y
2191,"BACKGROUND
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is fast becoming a global epidemic, and its prevalence is increasing in children and young adults. The aim of the study was to identify young adults who had type 2 DM or impaired fasting glucose as well as those at risk of these conditions using anthropometric data and behavioral pattern.


METHODOLOGY
Two hundred and twenty newly admitted undergraduates who were randomly selected during the registration process were involved in the study. Anthropometric parameters were measured while information on demographic details, medical history, and family history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method.


RESULTS
Two hundred and seven (94%) participants had serum glucose within reference range, 10 (4.6%) had impaired fasting glucose, and 3 (1.4%) had serum glucose> 7.1 mmol/L, which is indicative of DM. A large number (91.4%) of individuals engaged in physical activity equivalent to a walk of at least 30 min/day. Most of them (93.2%) had body mass index <25.0 while 6.8% were overweight. One hundred and three participants (46.8%) indicated that they eat 3 or more servings of whole grain per day.


CONCLUSION
Most of the participants are involved in healthy lifestyle. This has resulted in very low prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 DM among the group. It will be useful to follow up the group and note if they are able to maintain this trend since the risk of developing DM is known to increase with age.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192627,2017,Behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes mellitus among newly admitted undergraduates in a Nigerian University.,y

Seizures are common reasons for neurologic consultations and investigations. In the absence of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scanning of the brain is a reliable and cheaper alternative. Little is known about the pattern of brain lesions in patients with recurrent seizures in Nigeria.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the pattern of significant intracerebral lesions in patients presenting with recurrent seizures in a tertiary hospital in Enugu.


METHODS
All the medical and computer tomography records of patients with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent seizures were reviewed. The study duration was 11 years (January 2003 to December 2013). Relevant data were obtained and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 and GraphPad Prism 6.


RESULTS
The diagnostic yield of CT was 55.1%. Twenty (9.3%) individuals had two lesions each. The significant findings were tumors (20.4%), encephalomalacia (18.9%) and strokes (7.7% (ischemic stroke, 4.1%, intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.1%, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.5%). Hydrocephalus (HCP) was found in 18 (9.2%) cases, and 30% of them occurred together with other lesions. The diagnostic yield increased with age reaching 84.4% from the age of 60 years. Only patients with encephalomalacia were statistically older than those with normal imaging.


CONCLUSION
Computed tomography scan has a high diagnostic yield, especially in elderly patients with recurrent generalized seizures. Brain tumors, encephalomalacia, and HCP are most common causes of recurrent seizures in the adults.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192634,2017,"The Pattern of significant lesions found in computerized tomography scan of recurrent seizure patients at a center in Enugu, Nigeria.",y

Obesity can lead to psychological, social, and medical problems that may negatively affect the quality of life Aim: In our study, we aimed to evaluate the body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life of obese subjects in comparison with normal weighted ones.


METHODS
A total of 494 subjects, aged between 18 and 64 years, were included to the study. Patients with the body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥18.5-24.9 kg/m2 were assigned to the control group; BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 were assigned to the obese patient group. An ethical committee approval with protocol No. of 2011/242 was obtained from the Ethical Committee of EskiÅŸehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine. Interviews were performed two times with obese subjects in the 1st and the 6th month of weight loss program, once with the control group. Data identification form, the form which included the biochemical parameters, Trait Anxiety inventory, State anxiety scale, Quality of Life scale-Short Form [(SF-36)(QOL)], Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ), Zung Depression Rating Scale, and Zung Anxiety Rating Scale were applied to participants.


RESULTS
Obesity is more common in women. Obesity reduces the quality of life, negatively affects body perception, and triggers anxiety. Because of their body structure, obese individuals are exposed to social pressure and unethical attitudes.


CONCLUSIONS
Both health risks and social implications of obesity are important. Further studies are needed to ethically evaluate the psycho-social problems caused by obesity.",India,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,29192636,2017,"Assessment of body perception, psychological distress, and subjective quality of life among obese and nonobese subjects in Turkey.",y

This review aimed to explore the most contemporary evidence on whether poor oral health and dementia occurs in the same individuals or populations, to outline the nature of the relationship between these two health outcomes and to discuss the implication of any findings for health services and future research. The review was undertaken by a working group comprising consultant clinicians from medicine and dentistry, trainees, public health and academic staff. Whilst other rapid reviews in the current series limited their search to systematic reviews, this review focused on primary research involving cohort and case-control studies because of the lack of high level evidence in this new and important field. The results suggest that poor oral hygiene is associated with dementia, and more so amongst people in advanced stages of the disease. Suboptimal oral health (gingivitis, dental caries, tooth loss, edentulousness) appears to be associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.

2198,"Introduction Communication within the doctor-patient relationship is complex due to a variety of reasons; a patient's understanding may not correspond with the clinician's vocabulary, resulting in misunderstanding, anxiety and ill-informed decision making. We investigated the understanding of terminology commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine clinics.Methods We investigated patients' understanding using a questionnaire-based study in the out-patient setting. Age, gender, first language and highest educational level were recorded. The questionnaire included multiple choice questions regarding patients' understanding of words as well as asking patients to define certain terms. Vocabulary included 'ulcer', 'blister', 'cancer', 'malignant' and 'benign'.Results and conclusions Many patients have difficulty in understanding and explaining commonly used terminology. 'Blister' was the most commonly understood term, while 'benign' and 'lesion' were the least well understood. 'Tumour' was mistakenly thought of as synonymous with 'malignancy' by over a third of patients. Understanding was better among those for whom English was their first language. It is essential that all clinicians modify their language appropriately during consultations in order to deliver information in a comprehensive manner, to educate patients on their condition thus enabling informed decision making by patients.",England,British dental journal,29192691,2017,Patient understanding of commonly used oral medicine terminology.,y

RESULTS
We had a 44% response rate at 9 months after birth or loss from 377 bereaved mothers and 232 with surviving infants. Bereaved women were less likely to have hospital staff or family members present at delivery. African-American (versus Caucasian) mothers were half as likely to have first heard about their stillbirth from a physician or midwife.

Although incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms appears to be a barrier to successful self-care, there are few studies examining the relationship between self-care and levels of comprehensive understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms.


AIM
To determine whether incomplete understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms is associated with self-care in heart failure patients who were recently discharged from the hospital due to heart failure exacerbation.


METHODS
Patients completed the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale and questionnaire to assess knowledge of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Three groups were formed by their different levels of understanding of heart failure and its signs and symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether these three levels of understanding groups predicted self-care after controlling for demographic and clinical variables.


RESULTS
Of 571 patients 22.1%, 40.1% and 37.8% had poor, moderate, and complete understanding, respectively. Compared with patients in the poor understanding group, patients in complete and moderate understanding groups were more likely to have better adherence to self-care activities (standardized Î² = -0.14, 95% confidence interval -3.41, -0.47; standardized Î² = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -4.26, -1.23, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS

To maximise the benefits obtainable from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, an evaluation of physical fitness using reliable, clinically relevant tests is strongly recommended. Recently, objective tests of physical fitness have been implemented in the SWEDEHEART register. The reliability of these tests has, however, not been examined for patients with acute coronary syndrome.


AIMS
The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change of the symptom-limited bicycle ergometer test, the dynamic unilateral heel-lift test and the unilateral shoulder-flexion test in patients with acute coronary syndrome.


METHODS
In a longitudinal study design, a total of 40 patients (mean age 63.8 Â± 9.5 years, five women), with ACS, aged < 75 years, were included at a university hospital in Sweden. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval, standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsiveness in terms of the minimal detectable change were calculated.


RESULTS
Excellent reliability was found, showing ICC values of 0.98 (0.96-0.99), SEM 4.71 for the bicycle ergometer test, ICC 0.87 (0.75-0.93), SEM 4.62 for the shoulder-flexion test and ICC 0.84 (0.71-0.91), SEM 2.24 for the heel-lift test.

Analysis included quantitative evaluation of rater agreement. Overall inter-rater agreement of the assessment of facilitator performance was high (92%), and discrepancies in the agreement statistics were analysed. Face and content validity were further established, and usability was evaluated, through primary stakeholder post-pilot feedback, uncovering minor concerns, leading to tool revision.

2206,"Introduction Hypertension is one of the primary modifiable risk factors for cardiac and renal diseases. The prevalence of hypertension appears to be around 30-45% of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The administration of blood pressure-lowering drugs is to reduce the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes: stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiovascular deaths. Hypertension guidelines recommend combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk and with subclinical organ damage as well as when monotherapy fails. Areas covered As the etiology of essential hypertension is multifactorial, combination therapy using different classes of antihypertensive agents have greater effect than each on its own (synergistic effect), may have better tolerability (two components minimizing each other's side effects) and lead to improved patient compliance. Several studies assess the hypotensive efficacy on drug combination, there are also studies n triple drug combination. Expert commentary At present, dual and triple combination therapy is available to hypertensive patients with good clinical outcomes, compliance and low profile of side effects. Hypertensive patients usually have other cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. As patients' adherence to the pharmacological therapy significantly decreases the risk of long-term adverse events including mortality, use of single-pill combination therapy are not only good effects of free therapy but also better patient compliance. It appears that combinations not only of hypotensive drugs but also with statins will be widely used.

This study A) assessed whether levels of alcohol-related disciplinary actions on college campuses changed among MD college students after the 2011 Maryland (MD) state alcohol tax increase from 6% to 9%, and B) determined which school-level factors impacted the magnitude of changes detected.


METHOD
A quasi-experimental interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of panel data containing alcohol-related disciplinary actions on 33 MD college campuses in years 2006-2013. Negative binomial regression models were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in counts of alcohol-related disciplinary actions comparing time before and after the tax increase.


RESULTS
The ITS anaysis showed an insignificant relationship between alcohol-related disciplinary actions and tax implementation (Î² = -.27; p =.257) but indicated that alcohol-related disciplinary actions decreased significantly over the time under study (Î² = -.05; p =.022).


DISCUSSION
Alcohol related disciplinary actions did decrease over time in the years of study, and this relationship was correlated with several school-level characteristics, including school price, school funding type, types of degrees awarded, and specialty.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques.


METHODS
Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6Â mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28Â days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations.


RESULTS
FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions.

2210,"Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths.

2213,The amyloid beta (AÎ²) peptide is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insights into AÎ²-interacting proteins are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity. We recently undertook an in-depth in vitro interrogation of the AÎ²1-42 interactome using human frontal lobes as the biological source material and taking advantage of advances in mass spectrometry performance characteristics. These analyses uncovered the small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) to be the most selectively enriched binder to oligomeric AÎ²1-42. Subsequent validation experiments revealed that SST interferes with AÎ² fibrillization and promotes the formation of AÎ² assemblies characterized by a 50-60Â kDa SDS-resistant core. The distributions of SST and AÎ² overlap in the brain and SST has been linked to AD by several additional observations. This perspective summarizes this body of literature and draws attention to the fact that SST is one of several neuropeptide hormones that acquire amyloid properties before their synaptic release. The latter places the interaction between SST and AÎ² among an increasing number of observations that attest to the ability of amyloidogenic proteins to influence each other. A model is presented which attempts to reconcile existing data on the involvement of SST in the AD etiology.,United States,Prion,29192843,2017,Somatostatin in Alzheimer'S disease: A new Role for an Old Player.,y

2215,"OBJECTIVE The acquisition and refinement of cognitive and behavioral skills during development is associated with the maturation of various brain oscillatory activities. Most developmental investigations have identified distinct patterns of low-frequency electrophysiological activity that are characteristic of various behavioral milestones. In this investigation, the authors focused on the cross-sectional developmental properties of high-frequency spectral power from the brain's default mode network (DMN) during goal-directed behavior. METHODS The authors contrasted regionally specific, time-evolving high gamma power (HGP) in the lateral DMN cortex between 3 young children (age range 3-6 years) and 3 adults by use of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings over the left perisylvian cortex during a picture-naming task. RESULTS Across all participants, a nearly identical and consistent response suppression of HGP, which is a functional signature of the DMN, was observed during task performance recordings acquired from ECoG electrodes placed over the lateral DMN cortex. This finding provides evidence of relatively early maturation of the DMN. Furthermore, only HGP relative to evoked alpha and beta band power showed this level of consistency across all participants. CONCLUSIONS Regionally specific, task-evoked suppression of the high-frequency components of the cortical power spectrum is established early in brain development, and this response may reflect the early maturation of specific cognitive and/or computational mechanisms.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

We compared the heterogeneity of handwritten texts in tasks with different cognitive demands; the heterogeneity of texts was analyzed with lacunarity, a measure of geometrical invariance. In Experiment 1, we asked participants to perform two tasks that varied in cognitive demands: transcription and exposition about an autobiographical episode. Lacunarity was significantly lower in transcription. In Experiment 2, we compared a veridical and a fictitious version of a personal event. Lacunarity was lower in veridical texts.

The authors investigate the skills tapped by drawing and the risk factors associated with poor drawing. Self-portraits of 345 preschool children were scored by raters trained in using the Draw-a-Person Intellectual Ability test (DAP:IQ) rubric (C. R. Reynolds & J. A. Hickman, 2004). Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.",United States,The Journal of genetic psychology,29192871,2017,What Does the DAP:IQ Measure?: Drawing Comparisons between Drawing Performance and Developmental Assessments.,y

2220,"OBJECTIVE Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, more patients with a high body mass index (BMI) will require surgical treatment for degenerative spinal disease. In previous investigations of lumbar spine pathology, obesity has been associated with worsened postoperative outcomes and increased costs. However, few studies have examined the association between BMI and postoperative outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes, postoperative narcotics consumption, complications, and hospital costs among BMI stratifications for patients who have undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF procedures. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained surgical database of patients who had undergone primary 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spinal pathology between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified by BMI as follows: normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), or obese II-III (â‰¥ 35.0 kg/m2). Differences in patient demographics and preoperative characteristics were compared across the BMI cohorts using 1-way ANOVA or chi-square analysis. Multivariate linear or Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine the presence of an association between BMI category and narcotics utilization, improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores, incidence of complications, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, and hospital costs. Regression analyses were controlled for preoperative demographic and procedural characteristics. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients were included in the analysis, of whom 20.9% (n = 58) were normal weight, 37.5% (n = 104) were overweight, 24.9% (n = 69) were obese I, and 16.6% (n = 46) were obese II-III. A higher BMI was associated with an older age (p = 0.049) and increased comorbidity burden (p = 0.001). No differences in sex, smoking status, insurance type, diagnosis, presence of neuropathy, or preoperative VAS pain scores were found among the BMI cohorts (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found among these cohorts as regards operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and number of operative levels (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in postoperative narcotics consumption, VAS score improvement, complication rates, arthrodesis rates, reoperation rates, or total direct costs existed across BMI stratifications (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher BMI demonstrated surgical outcomes, narcotics consumption, and hospital costs comparable to those of patients with a lower BMI. Thus, ACDF procedures are both safe and effective for all patients across the entire BMI spectrum. Patients should be counseled to expect similar rates of postoperative complications and eventual clinical improvement regardless of their BMI.",United States,Journal of neurosurgery.

2221,"In response to varying stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor is able to promote repair, survival, or elimination of damaged cells - processes that have great relevance to organismal aging. Although the link between p53 and cancer is well established, the contribution of p53 to the aging process is less clear. Delineating how p53 regulates distinct aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered metabolic pathways will be critical. Mouse models have further revealed the centrality and complexity of the p53 network in aging processes. While naturally aged mice have linked longevity with declining p53 function, some accelerated aging mice present with chronic p53 activation, whose phenotypes can be rescued upon p53 deficiency. Further, direct modulation of the p53-MDM2 axis has correlated elevated p53 activity with either early aging or with delayed-onset aging. We speculate that p53-mediated aging phenotypes in these mice must have (1) stably active p53 due to MDM2 dysregulation or chronic stress or (2) shifted p53 outcomes. Pinpointing which p53 stressors, modifications, and outcomes drive aging processes will provide further insights into our understanding of the human aging process and could have implications for both cancer and aging therapeutics.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 1 December 2017; doi:10.1038/cdd.2017.187.",England,Cell death and differentiation,29192902,2017,Relevance of the p53-MDM2 axis to aging.,y

In recent years, the recovery-oriented approaches (along with experiences and thoughts of patients and patient's relatives) have been taken into account for establishing mental health services and policies. This study aims to identify the factors contributing to recovery, as observed from the perspective of schizophrenia patients working at The Blue Horse CafÃ© which was founded by the Federation of Schizophrenia Associations.


METHOD
The sample for the study consisted of 24 patients who worked at The Blue Horse CafÃ©. A phenomenological approach was used in the study, whereby interviews with patients were analyzed qualitatively.


RESULTS
Certain common factors, which were expressed as having contributed to recovery, were identified from the perspective of schizophrenia patients. These factors are: 1-The fact that the setting is informal and welcoming without being constrictive; 2-Predominance of the human element; 3-Hope and encouragement; 4-Being cared about; 5-Being able to reach someone when in need of support; 6-Friendly sharing; 7-Having a purpose, assuming responsibility, and being motivated; and 8-Giving meaning to life.


CONCLUSION
The findings may serve as a stimulus since schizophrenia patients that contribute to recovery give mental health professionals the opportunity to question there need for a change in their professional roles. Additionally, schizophrenia patients that have experienced The Blue Horse CafÃ© draw attention to certain points and these points can serve as a guide, especially for establishing the working METHODS of Community Mental Health Centers.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192939,2017,[Lessons Learned from Experiencing Mavi At CafÃ© (Blue Horse CafÃ©) during Six Years: A Qualitative Analysis of Factors Contributing to Recovery from the Perspective of Schizophrenia Patients].,y

Impairment in immune functions is proposed as a key factor in the cognitive decline in bipolar disorder (BD) however there is scarcity of research on the impact of inflammation on cognitive functions. Our aim is to compare IL-18 and IL-6 levels in BD patients and controls and to study the relationship between IL-18 and IL-6 levels and cognitive impairment METHOD: Thirty-six euthymic BD-I patients and 38 age, sex and educational level matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants were evaluated with neurocognitive tests. The plasma IL-6 and IL-18 levels of both groups were measured with ELISA kits.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between IL-6 and IL-18 levels of patient and healthy control groups. In the patient group, IL-18 level was positively correlated with completed categories score wheras there was a negative correlation with perseverative response and perseverative errors. Moreover IL-18 level was positively correlated with immediate recall, delayed recall and learning scores while there was a negative correlation with stroop interference scores. No correlation was found between IL-6 level and neuropsychological test scores in the patient group.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study that investigates the relation of IL-18 with cognitive functions.

This study aimed to examine the cognitive profiles of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the latter of which was recently standardized in Turkey. In addition, the reading abilities and intelligence scores of these children were also investigated.


METHODS
A total of 48 children with ADHD between the ages of 6 and 16 years who were outpatients in MuÅŸ State Hospital were included in this study. The children were administered the WISC-R, the WISC-IV, and the Oral Reading Skills and Reading Comprehension Test (ORCT).


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between the WISC-R IQ scores and WISC-IV index scores. Moreover, reading comprehension skills (derived from ORCT scores) were predicted with significant accuracy by both the WISC-R Verbal IQ and the WISC-IV WMI (Working Memory Index).


CONCLUSION
Results of this study suggest that the WISC-R and the WISC-IV scale are not sufficient for obtaining a specific cognitive profile for ADHD - there is no significant difference between them. However, the four-factor structure of the WISC-IV is believed to provide more specific information. In addition, results of this study related to reading skills indicate that the importance of reading skills should not be overlooked when assessing children with ADHD.",Turkey,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,29192943,2017,[Comparing Two Editions of Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Assessing Reading Skills in Children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder].,y

We aimed to review the literature related to attention, memory, and executive functions in PTSD. Although studies on the subject are limited (in that there is no uniformity in terms of trauma type, selection of the control groups or types of neuropsychological tests used), most reported similar deficits in PTSD subjects in terms of memory and executive functions including attention. Since the presence of psychiatric comorbidities may disrupt neuropsychological functions, results of studies that have not controlled comorbidity may be questionable. However, studies that excluded the comorbid conditions reported similar deficits in cognitive functions in PTSD patients. The relationship between recovery from PTSD symptoms and change in cognitive functions has been examined in only a few studies, and most have reported an improvement for both memory and executive functions in remitted patients. The improvement in executive functions, however, has been limited by the difficulty of task. Cognitive deficits have been among the major causes of disabilities in PTSD patients.

In addition, damage to the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) can result in decreased spontaneity. Neuropsychological tests are important components in the assessment of EF including goal-directed behavior, decision-making, risk assessment, making plans for the future, setting of priorities and order of our actions.

Dementia-related behavioral symptoms and functional dependence result in poor quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The goal was to determine whether a home-based activity program (Tailored Activity Program; TAP-VA) would reduce behavioral symptoms and functional dependence of veterans with dementia and caregiver burden.


DESIGN
Single-blind (interviewer), parallel, randomized, controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01357564).


SETTING
Veteran's homes.


PARTICIPANTS
Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 160 dyads).


INTERVENTION
Dyads in TAP-VA underwent 8 sessions with occupational therapists to customize activities to the interests and abilities of the veterans and educate their caregivers about dementia and use of customized activity. Caregivers assigned to attention control received up to 8 telephone-based dementia education sessions with a research team member.


MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcomes included number of behaviors and frequency of their occurrence multiplied by severity of occurrence; secondary outcomes were functional dependence, pain, emotional well-being, caregiver burden (time spent caregiving, upset with behaviors) and affect at 4 (primary endpoint) and 8 months.


RESULTS
Of 160 dyads (n = 76 TAP-VA; n = 84 control), 111 completed 4-month interviews (n = 51 TAP-VA; n = 60 control), and 103 completed 8-month interviews (n = 50 TAP-VA; n = 53 control). At 4 months, compared to controls, the TAP-VA group showed reductions in number (difference in mean change from baseline = -0.68, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.13) and frequency by severity (-24.3, 95% CI = -45.6 to -3.1) of behavioral symptoms, number of activities needing assistance with (-0.80, 95% CI = -1.41 to -0.20), functional dependence level (4.09, 95% CI = 1.06, 7.13), and pain (-1.18, 95% CI = -2.10 to -0.26). Caregivers of veterans in TAP-VA reported less behavior-related distress. Benefits did not extend to 8 months.

Smoke-free laws reduce disease prevalence. The impact of municipal smoke-free laws on lung cancer incidence in Kentucky was examined. The authors hypothesized that lung cancer incidence rates would be associated with the strength of smoke-free laws.


METHODS
This was a secondary analysis of 83,727 Kentucky residents agedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50 years who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 1995 to 2014. In 2014, 33 municipalities had 1 or more smoke-free laws. County-level characteristics included adult smoking rate, sex, race/ethnicity, income, physician supply, observed radon values, and rurality.


RESULTS
Individuals living in communities with comprehensive smoke-free laws were 7.9% less likely than those living in communities without smoke-free protections to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The difference in lung cancer incidence between counties with moderate/weak laws and those without laws was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with fewer new cases of lung cancer, whereas weak or moderate smoke-free laws did not confer the same benefit. One hundred percent smoke-free laws, covering all workers and the public with few or no exceptions, may be key in reducing new cases of lung cancer.

For this purpose, we developed a large-scale clustered randomised experiment involving over 9,000 high school seniors from 62 Italian schools. We designed a counseling intervention to correct student misperceptions of the profitability of HE, that is, the costs, economic returns and chances of success of investments in different tertiary programs. We employed a longitudinal survey to test whether treated students' educational trajectories evolved differently relative to a control group. We find that, overall, treated students enrolled less often in less remunerative fields of study in favour of postsecondary vocational programmes. Most importantly, this effect varied substantially by parental social class and level of education. The shift towards vocational programmes was mainly due to the offspring of low-educated parents; in contrast, children of tertiary graduates increased their participation in more rewarding university fields. Similarly, the redistribution from weak fields to vocational programmes mainly involved the children of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class, while upper class students invested in more rewarding university fields. We argue that the status-maintenance model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe can explain these socially differentiated treatment effects. Overall, our results challenge the claim that student misperceptions contribute to horizontal inequalities in access to HE.",England,The British journal of sociology,29193014,2017,Information barriers and social stratification in higher education: evidence from a field experiment.,y

To examine the diagnostic ability of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; <36wks postmenstrual age) to detect later adverse motor outcomes or cerebral palsy (CP) in infants born preterm.


METHOD
Studies of infants born preterm with MRI earlier than 36 weeks postmenstrual age and quantitative motor data or a diagnosis of CP at or beyond 1 year corrected age were identified. Study details were extracted and meta-analyses performed where possible. Quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 (a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies).


RESULTS
Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which reported diagnostic accuracy and five reported data sufficient for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. Early structural MRI global scores detected a later diagnosis of CP with a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86-100) and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 59-100). Global structural MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 44-100) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 90-100). White matter scores determined adverse motor outcomes with a pooled sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 20-48) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 78-88).


INTERPRETATION
Early structural MRI has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine adverse motor outcomes and CP in infants born preterm. Greater reporting of diagnostic accuracy in studies examining relationships with motor outcomes and CP is required to facilitate clinical utility of early MRI.


WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reasonable sensitivity and specificity to determine later adverse motor outcomes and cerebral palsy (CP). Detection of infants who progressed to CP was stronger than motor outcomes. Global MRI scores determined adverse motor outcomes more accurately than white matter scores.

To examine the factors contributing to nurses choosing to exit the nursing profession before retirement age.


BACKGROUND
Population growth, ageing and growing demand for health services mean increased demand for nurses. Better retention could help meet this demand, yet little work has been done in New Zealand to understand early attrition.


METHODS
An online survey of registered and enrolled nurses and nurse practitioners who had left nursing was used. This study reports analysis of responses from 285 ex-nurses aged under 55.


FINDINGS
The primary reasons nurses left the profession were as follows: workplace concerns; personal challenges; career factors; family reasons; lack of confidence; leaving for overseas; unwillingness to complete educational requirements; poor work-life balance; and inability to find suitable nursing work. Most nurses discussed their intentions to leave with a family member or manager and most reported gaining transferrable skills through nursing.


CONCLUSIONS
Nurses leave for many reasons. Implementing positive practice environments and individualized approaches to retaining staff may help reduce this attrition. Generational changes in the nature of work and careers mean that nurses may continue to leave the profession sooner than anticipated by policymakers.


IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
If the nursing workforce is to be able to meet projected need, education, recruitment and retention policies must urgently address issues leading to early attrition. In particular, policies improving the wider environmental context of nursing practice and ensuring that working environments are safe and nurses are well supported must be developed and implemented. Equally, national nursing workforce planning must take into account that nursing is no longer viewed as a career for life.",England,International nursing review,29193041,2017,Early nurse attrition in New Zealand and associated policy implications.,y

2236,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic sleep deficiency is associated with early mortality. In the epileptic population, there is a higher prevalence of sleep disorders, and individuals with severe refractory epilepsy are at greater risk of premature mortality than the general population. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affects 1:1000 cases of epilepsy each year. Ketogenic diet (KD) treatment is one of the few effective options for refractory seizures. Despite KD reducing seizures and increasing longevity in Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, they still succumb to sudden death. This study aims to determine whether (1) the rest profiles of KO and KD-treated KO (KOKD) mice resemble each other as a function of either age or proximity to death and (2) the timing of death correlates with acute or chronic changes in rest.


METHODS
Noninvasive actimetry was used to monitor rest throughout the lives of KO and wild-type (WT) littermates administered standard diet or KD.


RESULTS
As KO mice age, rest is reduced (PÂ <Â .0001). Rest is significantlyÂ improved in KDKO mice (PÂ <Â .0001), resembling WT values at several ages. When age is removed as a variable and data are realigned to the day of death, the rest profiles of KO and KOKD groups worsen to similar degrees as a function of proximity to death. The amount of rest acutely is not sensitive to the timing of death, whereas chronic rest deficiency profiles (10-15Â days prior to death) of both groups were indistinguishable. Chronic accumulation of rest deficiency over the final 15Â days was associated with 75% of deaths.


SIGNIFICANCE
Our data suggest that the accumulated rest deficiency is associated with sudden death in Kv1.1 KO mice. These data (1) support the proposed clinical hypothesis that chronic sleep deficiency may be associated with early mortality in epileptic patients and (2) warrant future preclinical and clinical studies on sleep monitoring in epileptic patients.",United States,Epilepsia,29193044,2017,"Accumulation of rest deficiency precedes sudden death of epileptic Kv1.1 knockout mice, a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",y
2237,"In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of cross-cultural validation and replicability (i.e. measurement invariance) of the Belief in a Zero-Sum Game (BZSG) scale, measuring antagonistic belief about interpersonal relations over scarce resources. The factorial structure of the BZSG scale was investigated in student samples from 36 countries (N = 9907), using separate confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) for each country. The cross-cultural validation of the scale was based on multigroup confirmatory factor analyses (MGCFA). The results confirmed that the scale had a one-factor structure in all countries, in which configural and metric invariance between countries was confirmed. As a zero-sum belief about social relations perceived as antagonistic, BZSG is an important factor related to, for example, social and international relations, attitudes toward immigrants, or well-being. The paper proposes different uses of the BZSG scale for cross-cultural studies in different fields of psychology: social, political, or economic.",England,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,29193046,2017,Measurement invariance of the Belief in a Zero-Sum Game scale across 36 countries.,y
2238,"Since culturally salient stimuli for emotion recognition are scarce in India, we developed and validated a set of 140 coloured pictures of six basic emotions along with a neutral expression. The expressions were posed by four expressers, two males and two females, with mean age of 25.25 (SD 3.77) years. The expressions were captured from five different angles keeping the background uniform. These pictures were shown to 350 undergraduates who labelled the emotion and rated their intensity.

2239,"OBJECTIVE
Using a ""double-pulse"" adaptation paradigm, in which two stimuli are presented in quick succession, this study examines the neural mechanisms underlying potentiation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) in visual snow syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Visual snow is a persistent visual disturbance characterized by rapid flickering dots throughout the visual field. Like the related condition of migraine with aura, visual snow has been hypothesized to arise from abnormal neuronal responsiveness, as demonstrated by a lack of typical VEP habituation to repeated visual stimulation. Yet the exact neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Previous ""double-pulse"" experiments suggest that typical VEP habituation reflects disruptive gamma-band (50-70 Hz) neural oscillations, possibly driven by inhibitory interneurons. Given that migraine has been associated with reduced cortical inhibition, we propose here that visual snow may likewise reflect diminished inhibitory activity, resulting in decreased gamma power following initial visual stimulation and concomitant potentiation of the subsequent VEP response.


METHODS
We compared VEP responses to double-pulse adaptation in a 22-year-old man with a 2-year history of visual snow versus a group of age- and gender-matched controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). The patient does not have a comorbid diagnosis of episodic migraine or migraine with aura, and controls had no personal or family history of migraine.


RESULTS
In contrast to the pattern of habituation observed in controls, visual snow was associated with persistent potentiation of the VEP response. Consistent with our predictions, time-frequency analysis revealed reduced gamma-band power following the initial stimulus in visual snow relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support an antagonistic interplay between gamma power and rapid neural adaptation, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms of VEP potentiation in visual snow.",United States,Headache,29193050,2017,Antagonistic Relationship Between VEP Potentiation and Gamma Power in Visual Snow Syndrome.,y
2240,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies show migraineurs are at an increased risk of developing suicidal behaviors, even after controlling for comorbid depression. However, previous research has not examined the impact of psychiatric mood disorders on suicidal behaviors in migraineurs within a nationally representative sample.


OBJECTIVE
A cross-sectional study was used to investigate the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors and determine whether psychiatric comorbidities modify this association in a nationwide inpatient cohort.


METHODS
We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations compiled from USA billing data. Migraine, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric disorders were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes from hospitalization discharges (2007-2012). Weighted national estimates were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
156,172,826 hospitalizations were included, of which 1.4% had a migraine diagnosis and 1.6% had a diagnosis of suicidal behavior. Migraineurs had a 2.07-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.96-2.19) compared with non-migraineurs. We repeated analyses after stratifying by depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among hospitalizations with depression, migraine was associated with a 20% reduced odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 0.76-0.85). Among hospitalizations without depression, migraine was associated with 2.35-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 2.20-2.51). In stratified analyses, we noted that among hospitalizations with anxiety, migraineurs had slightly increased odds of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.13). Among hospitalizations without anxiety, migraine was associated with a 2.06-fold increased odds of suicidal behaviors (95%CI: 1.94-2.20). Similarly, in analyses stratified by PTSD, migraine was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.94-1.07) among those with PTSD. However, the odds of suicidal behaviors were increased among hospitalizations without PTSD (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.84-2.08).


CONCLUSION
Chronic conditions that do not affect the current hospitalization may not have been reported. The presence of psychiatric diagnoses influences associations of suicidal behaviors with migraine in a national inpatient sample. Migraineurs with diagnosed comorbid psychiatric disorders may be receiving care that mitigates their risk for suicidal behaviors.",United States,Headache,29193052,2017,Association Between Migraine and Suicidal Behaviors: A Nationwide Study in the USA.,y
2241,"Variation in the shape of the human face and in stature is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental influences. One such environmental influence is malnourishment, which can result in growth faltering, usually diagnosed by means of comparing an individual's stature with a set of age-appropriate standards. These standards for stature, however, are typically ascertained in groups where people are at low risk for growth faltering. Moreover, genetic differences among populations with respect to stature are well established, further complicating the generalizability of stature-based diagnostic tools. In a large sample of children aged 5-19 years, we obtained high-resolution genomic data, anthropometric measures and 3D facial images from individuals within and around the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. With genome-wide complex trait analysis, we partitioned genetic and environmental variance for growth outcomes and facial shape. We found that children with growth faltering have faces that look like those of older and taller children, in a direction opposite to the expected allometric trajectory, and in ways predicted by the environmental portion of covariance at the community and individual levels. The environmental variance for facial shape varied subtly but significantly among communities, whereas genetic differences were minimal. These results reveal that facial shape preserves information about exposure to undernourishment, with important implications for refining assessments of nutritional status in children and the developmental-genetics of craniofacial variation alike.",England,Journal of anatomy,29193055,2017,Facial shape manifestations of growth faltering in Tanzanian children.,y

Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive change resulting from challenging life events. The current study examined factors associated with PTG in traumatically injured patients 1 year postinjury.


METHOD
Participants (NÂ =Â 221) in this prospective cohort study included adults admitted to a Level I trauma center. Over half the participants (60%) were male, with a mean age of 47. Participants completed baseline measures during hospitalization. PTG was assessed at 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Greater PTG was associated with minority race/ethnicity, lower income, automotive collision, and premorbid psychological disorder other than depression or posttraumatic stress (PTS). These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients. Analysis confirmed that greater PTS at follow-up was associated with more growth.

2243,"The adolescent brain is vulnerable to long-lasting cognitive disturbances resulting from nicotine exposure. Although exercise has been used as an intervention for ameliorating cognitive deficits in various disorders, the effect on cognitive changes induced by nicotine exposure and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on nicotine reward-associated cognitive behaviors in adolescent rats subjected to nicotine conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Male adolescent rats were trained on the Go/NoGo task, then subjected to nicotine CPP, and then randomly separated into four groups: sedentary (SED) and high- (HE), moderate- (ME) and low-intensity (LE) exercise. Rats in exercise groups performed treadmill running 30 min daily for 10 days. Results showed that MEs had shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze (MWM) test compared to SEDs. Although time spent and distance swam in the target quadrant significantly increased in both the MEs and HEs, the number of target quadrant crosses increased significantly only in MEs. MEs and HEs showed higher performance accuracy on NoGo and lower scores on CPP tasks. Expression of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and downstream signaling molecules increased in MEs in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus, with Î±7 nAChRs expression positively associated with NoGo accuracy and MWM probe test performance, but negatively correlated with CPP scores. The findings of this study suggest that moderate-intensity exercise can improve nicotine induced cognitive behaviors, and implicates prefrontal cortical Î±7 nAChR-mediated signal transduction as a possible mechanism.

The highest break points occurred during the token reinforcement condition for two out of three participants, but response rates tended to be higher with edibles. We then evaluated the effects of presession access to edibles on the break points of edible items and tokens with two participants. Break points decreased only in the edible reinforcement condition, and the participants chose to work for leisure items rather than edibles when presession access to edibles was in place.

In an Internet study, participants who first completed verbal attitude measures were more likely to donate to a Jewish organisation compared to those who completed the measures after making the decision to donate. Moreover, responses to attitude measures of various types and donating to the Jewish organisation were correlated when attitudes had been expressed in the first step. When attitudes were measured after the decision to donate, only the responses to the traditional anti-Semitic scale were correlated with this behaviour. In the field study, in which the time interval between attitude and behaviour measures was introduced, no question-behaviour effect was observed.

2246,"Auditory brainstem neurons are functionally primed to fire action potentials (APs) at markedly high-rates in order to rapidly encode acoustic information of sound. This specialization is critical for survival and the comprehension of behaviourally relevant communication functions, including sound localization and understanding speech in noise. Here, we investigated underlying ion channel mechanisms essential for high-rate AP firing in neurons of the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM) - the avian analog of bushy cells of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. In addition to the established function of high-voltage activated potassium channels, we found that resurgent sodium current (INaR ) plays a role in regulating rapid firing activity of late-developing (embryonic [E] days 19-21) NM neurons. INaR of late-developing NM neurons showed similar properties with mammalian neurons in that its unique mechanism of an ""open channel block state"" facilitated the recovery and increased the availability of sodium (NaV ) channels after depolarization. Using a computational model of NM neurons, we demonstrated that removal of INaR reduced high-rate AP firing. We found weak INaR during a prehearing period (E11-12), which transformed to resemble late-developing INaR properties around hearing onset (E14-16). Anatomically, we detected strong NaV 1.6 expression near maturation, which became increasingly less distinct at hearing onset and prehearing periods, suggesting that multiple NaV channel subtypes may contribute to INaR during development. We conclude that INaR plays an important role in regulating rapid AP firing for NM neurons, a property that may be evolutionarily conserved for functions related to similar avian and mammalian hearing.

Six male Wistar rats were exposed to sessions in which behavioral variability was reinforced according to a Lag contingency: Sequences of three responses on two levers had to differ from one, two or three previous sequences for shocks to be avoided (Lag 1, Lag 2 and Lag 3, respectively). Performance under the Lag conditions was compared with performance on a Yoke condition in which the animals received the same reinforcement frequency and distribution as in the Lag condition but behavioral variability was not required. The results showed that most of the subjects varied their sequences under the Lag contingencies, avoiding shocks with relatively high probability (â‰¥ 0.7). Under the Yoke procedure, responding continued to occur with high probability, but the behavioral variability decreased. These results suggest that behavioral variability can be negatively reinforced.",United States,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,29193141,2017,Behavioral variability as avoidance behavior.,y
2248,"BACKGROUND
Exposure to alcohol content in movies has been shown to be associated with adolescent use of alcohol, including earlier onset. This study examined the influence of movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol onset, considering the social context (whether the movie was viewed with a friend or parent). We examined whether media's influence holds across a spectrum of early drinking milestones: sipping (but not consuming a full drink of) alcohol, consuming a full drink of alcohol, and engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED).


METHODS
Data were taken from a sample of 882 middle school youth (52% female; 24% non-White) enrolled in an ongoing study on alcohol initiation and progression. Exposure to alcohol content in films was measured using a method that combines content analysis and random assignment of movie titles to youth surveys. The hazard of initiating alcohol use (sip, full drink, HED) as a function of exposure was estimated using survival analysis. Associations were adjusted for demographic, personality, and social influence factors known to be associated with both movie exposure and alcohol use.


RESULTS
Exposure to alcohol content was common. Hours of exposure prospectively predicted earlier onset of alcohol involvement across all outcomes. Viewing movies with friends appeared to augment the media exposure effect, in contrast to viewing movies with parents, which was not a significant predictor of initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to alcohol in films is involved in the entry into early stages of alcohol involvement. Findings support further investigation into the role of the media in underage drinking, especially in the context of consuming media with friends and peers. Limiting media exposure and/or stronger Federal Trade Commission oversight of movie ratings should be a priority for preventing underage drinking.",England,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",29193150,2017,Exposure to Alcohol Content in Movies and Initiation of Early Drinking Milestones.,y

2250,"The primary goal of this study was to examine and describe the importance of childbearing as perceived by infertile women in the Chinese familial and social context. We adopted a qualitative descriptive method and conducted semi-structured interviews with female patients diagnosed with infertility. Participants were recruited at a high-volume fertility clinic in Tianjin, China. Fifteen women with a diagnosis of infertility were interviewed for 60-90â€‰min. Data were analyzed by thematic analysis. Two themes supported the importance of childbearing for Chinese women with infertility: childbearing as natural law, and childbearing for relational harmony. Childbearing as natural law referred to intrinsic forces to seek a child, including (i) achieving motherhood and womanhood and (ii) experiencing a developmental transition with childbearing as a landmark. Relational harmony included three primary factors: (i) to maintain marital quality by preventing marital failure and rejuvenating an unsatisfactory marital relationship; (ii) to fulfill both authoritative and reciprocal filial piety; (iii) to build a sense of normalcy within family and social networks. In summary, infertility resulted in loss of motherhood, womanhood, and a smooth developmental transition. Moreover, it threatened relationship harmony in the marriage, family, and social life. These insights on the value of childbearing in the Chinese context can inform healthcare professionals in identify infertility-related demands and developing relevant psychosocial services for people with infertility.",United States,Research in nursing & health,29193167,2017,Childbearing importance: A qualitative study of women with infertility in China.,y

As the workforce ages, occupational injuries from falls on the same level will increase. Some industries may be more affected than others.

RESULTS
Same-level fall injury incidence rates increase with age in all four sectors. However, patterns of rate ratios and rate differences vary by age group, gender, and industry. Younger workers, men, and manufacturing workers generally have lower rates.

However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases. Therefore, in terms of mitigating emerging infectious diseases, both media publicity focused on how to guide people's behaviour change and positive responses of individuals are critical.",England,Statistics in medicine,29193194,2017,Impact of individual behaviour change on the spread of emerging infectious diseases.,y

While it is known that informal caregiving is associated with care-derived self-esteem cross-sectionally, little is known about the impact of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. Thus, we aimed at examining whether informal caregiving affects general self-esteem using a longitudinal approach.


METHODS
Data were gathered from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 40 and over in Germany from 2002 to 2014 (n = 21 271). General self-esteem was quantified using the Rosenberg scale. Individuals were asked whether they provide informal care regularly.


RESULTS
Fixed effects regressions showed no significant effect of informal caregiving on general self-esteem longitudinally. General self-esteem decreased with increasing morbidity, increasing age, decreasing social ties, whereas it was not associated with changes in employment status, marital status and body mass index. Additional models showed that decreases in self-esteem were associated with decreases in functional health and increases in depressive symptoms.

Ethical standards were followed throughout the study. The findings revealed one main theme: 'ambivalence in the need of knowledge' showing that lifelong medical treatment and the need for medical controls, in general, meant experiencing feelings of 'it doesn't matter, but it does matter' and 'being in the hands of the healthcare system'. The older persons lacked knowledge about their condition, which generated poor insight into their medical treatment and this in turn affected their daily life. They had thoughts and questions about their medication, but did not have an opportunity to ask the questions because of lack of follow-up from the healthcare system.

2256,"Animals maintained in captivity exhibit rapid changes in phenotypic traits, which may be maladaptive for natural environments. The phenotype can shift away from the wild phenotype via transgenerational effects, with the environment experienced by parents influencing the phenotype and fitness of offspring. There is emerging evidence that controlling transgenerational effects could help mitigate the effects of captivity, improving the success of captively bred animals post release. However, controlling transgenerational effects requires knowledge of the mechanisms driving transgenerational changes. To better understand the genetic mechanisms that contribute to transgenerational effects in captivity we investigated the heritability of behavioral phenotypes using mid parent- and single parent-offspring regressions in a population of captive-reared house mouse (Mus musculus) that we had previously shown exhibit transgenerational changes in boldness and activity behavioral types. Slopes for boldness and activity were all positive, indicating a low to moderate degree of heritability. Though, none of the heritability estimates were statistically significant due to the large surrounding errors. However, the large error surrounding the heritability estimates may also indicate that there is variability in heritability between behavioral traits within the boldness and activity behavioral types. The implication of this finding is that the potential for heritable genetic changes in captivity varies considerably between traits. We conclude that continued investigation of the potential for traits to evolve in captivity is needed to better inform captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",United States,Zoo biology,29193268,2017,What role does heritability play in transgenerational phenotypic responses to captivity?

2258,"For species at risk of decline or extinction in source-sink systems, sources are an obvious target for habitat protection actions. However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for three endangered species. Using empirically-based habitat-population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of time periods of data collection and prioritized the strongest sources for conservation. We then tested the ability of prioritized patches to identify the most habitats most affecting persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Our results indicated that conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection can impact species persistence. Shorter times series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. As source-sink metrics (i.e., births-deaths; births and immigrations - deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many non-equilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.

There was a significant total indirect effect of PTSD through depression and anxiety on somatic complaints, b = 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.12, 0.16], from which an indirect effect of PTSD on somatic complaints through depression was b = 0.08, 95% CI [0.06, 0.10], and through anxiety it equaled b = 0.06, 95% CI [0.04, 0.07]. The ratio of indirect to total effect was 0.66, 95% CI [0.59, 0.75]. The present study helps us to understand the role of depression and anxiety symptoms when the symptoms of PTSD and somatic complaints are present. These new findings may have implications for the management as well as treatment of PTSD because they recognize the importance of symptoms of anxiety and depression when somatic complaints are present.",United States,Journal of traumatic stress,29193294,2017,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Somatic Complaints in a Deployed Cohort of Georgian Military Personnel: Mediating Effect of Depression and Anxiety.,y
2260,"PURPOSE
Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+.


METHODS
Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income.


FINDINGS
In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064).


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional. Distinct elements of rural-urban status may influence health in nuanced ways that require additional exploration in future studies.",England,The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,29193298,2017,What Aspects of Rural Life Contribute to Rural-Urban Health Disparities in Older Adults?

2261,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a novel feature refinement MR reconstruction method from highly undersampled multichannel acquisitions for improving the image quality and preserve more detail information.


THEORY AND METHODS
The feature refinement technique, which uses a feature descriptor to pick up useful features from residual image discarded by sparsity constrains, is applied to preserve the details of the image in compressed sensing and parallel imaging in MRI (CS-pMRI). The texture descriptor and structure descriptor recognizing different types of features are required for forming the feature descriptor. Feasibility of the feature refinement was validated using three different multicoil reconstruction methods on in vivo data.


RESULTS
Experimental results show that reconstruction methods with feature refinement improve the quality of reconstructed image and restore the image details more accurately than the original methods, which is also verified by the lower values of the root mean square error and high frequency error norm.


CONCLUSION
A simple and effective way to preserve more useful detailed information in CS-pMRI is proposed. This technique can effectively improve the reconstruction quality and has superior performance in terms of detail preservation compared with the original version without feature refinement.

2263,"Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures and abnormal electrical activity in the brain, is one of the most prevalent brain disorders. Over two million people in the United States have been diagnosed with epilepsy and 3% of the general population will be diagnosed with it at some point in their lives. While most developmental epilepsies occur due to genetic predisposition, a class of ""acquired"" epilepsies results from a variety of brain insults. A leading etiological factor for epilepsy that is currently on the rise is traumatic brain injury (TBI), which accounts for up to 20% of all symptomatic epilepsies. Remarkably, the presence of an identified early insult that constitutes a risk for development of epilepsy provides a therapeutic window in which the pathological processes associated with brain injury can be manipulated to limit the subsequent development of recurrent seizure activity and epilepsy. Recent studies have revealed diverse pathologies, including enhanced excitability, activated immune signaling, cell death, and enhanced neurogenesis within a week after injury, suggesting a period of heightened adaptive and maladaptive plasticity. An integrated understanding of these processes and their cellular and molecular underpinnings could lead to novel targets to arrest epileptogenesis after trauma. This review attempts to highlight and relate the diverse early changes after trauma and their role in development of epilepsy and suggests potential strategies to limit neurological complications in the injured brain.",United States,Journal of neuroscience research,29193309,2017,Converging early responses to brain injury pave the road to epileptogenesis.,y
2264,"The signaling network involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not yet fully understood. This review aims to describe possible mechanisms through which the bacterial modulators may be linked directly or indirectly to the process of alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. From the late 1970s to present, new paradigm shifts have been developed regarding our understanding of pathological bone remodeling in periodontal disease. Upcoming evidence suggests that in periodontal disease the local immune response is exacerbated and involves the existence of signaling pathways that have been shown to modulate bone-cell function leading to alveolar bone loss. Those complex signaling pathways have been observed not only between bacteria but also between bacteria and the gingival surface of the host. More specifically, it has been shown that bacteria, through their secretion molecules, may interact indirectly and directly with immune-type cells of the host, resulting in the production of osteolytic agents that enhance bone resorption. Further research is required to provide a clear understanding of the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, and the availability of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis, may be useful tools in achieving this.",Denmark,Periodontology 2000,29193310,2017,Bacterial modulators of bone remodeling in the periodontal pocket.,y
2265,"Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should combine individual level participant data across studies of children's responses to disasters to better understand PTSS trajectories.",United States,Journal of traumatic stress,29193316,2017,Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Trajectories Among Children After Disaster Exposure: A Review.,y

2267,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the longitudinal association of dual and single (vision and hearing) sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults.


METHODS
Two thousand eight hundred ninety adults aged 60Â years or over who participated in the longitudinal population-based TromsÃ¸ Study, Norway, were included. The impact of objective vision loss, self-report hearing loss, or dual sensory loss on symptoms of depression and anxiety, as assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 10, was examined at baseline and 6-year follow-up using linear mixed models.


RESULTS
Hearing loss had a cross-sectional relationship with increased depression (bÂ =Â 0.1750, SEÂ =Â 0.07, PÂ =Â .02) and anxiety symptoms (bÂ =Â 0.1765, SEÂ =Â 0.08, PÂ =Â .03); however, these relationships were not significant at the 6-year follow-up. Both vision loss only and dual sensory loss predicted increased depression scores at follow-up (bÂ =Â 0.0220, SEÂ =Â 0.01, PÂ =Â .03; and bÂ =Â 0.0413, SEÂ =Â 0.02, PÂ =Â .01, respectively). Adjustment for social isolation did not attenuate the main depression results.


CONCLUSION
Dual sensory loss resulted in increased depression symptomatology over time and posed an additional long-term risk to depression severity beyond having a single sensory loss only. Only hearing loss is associated with anxiety symptoms. Older adults with vision, hearing, and dual sensory loss have different mental health profiles. Therefore, management and intervention should be tailored to the type of sensory loss.",England,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,29193338,2017,"The association amongst visual, hearing, and dual sensory loss with depression and anxiety over 6Â years: The TromsÃ¸ Study.",y
2268,"PURPOSE
Dynamic manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) allows assessment of tissue viability by tracing manganese uptake. We aimed to develop a rapid T1 mapping method for dynamic MEMRI to facilitate assessments of murine kidney viability.


METHODS
A multi-slice saturation recovery fast spin echo (MSRFSE) was developed, validated, and subsequently applied in dynamic MEMRI at 16.4T on ischemic mouse kidneys after 4 weeks of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Baseline T1 values and post-contrast R1 (1/T1 ) changes were measured in cortex (CO), outer (OSOM), inner (ISOM) strips of outer medulla, and inner medulla (IM).


RESULTS
Validation studies showed strong agreement between MSRFSE and an established saturation recovery Look-Locker method. Baseline T1 (s) increased in the stenotic kidney CO (2.10 [1.95-2.56] vs. 1.88 [1.81-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0317) and OSOM (2.17 [2.05-2.33] vs. 1.96 [1.87-2.00], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0075) but remained unchanged in ISOM and IM. This method allowed a temporal resolution of 1.43â€‰min in dynamic MEMRI. Mn2+ uptake and retention decreased in stenotic kidneys, particularly in the OSOM (Î”R1 : 0.48 [0.38-0.56] vs. 0.64 [0.61-0.69] s-1 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).

2269,"PURPOSE
In typical MRI protocols, time is spent acquiring a field map to calculate the shim settings for best image quality. We propose a fast template-based field map prediction method that yields near-optimal shims without measuring the field.


METHODS
The template-based prediction method uses prior knowledge of the B0 distribution in the human brain, based on a large database of field maps acquired from different subjects, together with subject-specific structural information from a quick localizer scan. The shimming performance of using the template-based prediction is evaluated in comparison to a range of potential fast shimming methods.


RESULTS
Static B0 shimming based on predicted field maps performed almost as well as shimming based on individually measured field maps. In experimental evaluations at 7â€‰T, the proposed approach yielded a residual field standard deviation in the brain of on average 59â€‰Hz, compared with 50â€‰Hz using measured field maps and 176â€‰Hz using no subject-specific shim.


CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that shimming based on predicted field maps is feasible. The field map prediction accuracy could potentially be further improved by generating the template from a subset of subjects, based on parameters such as head rotation and body mass index.

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.


OBJECTIVES
Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.


METHODS
Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: ""tremor"", ""tremor disorders"", ""essential tremor"", ""dystonic tremor"", and ""classification"" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.


RESULTS
Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2.

Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes.


METHODS
Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite scores.


RESULTS
Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.03 units/year, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003); this difference was comparable with 8â€‰years of aging. However, being in the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal (pâ€‰=â€‰0.71) or global score (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory decline (multivariable-adjusted mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰-0.01 units/year, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.002; pâ€‰=â€‰0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive function-attention decline.


CONCLUSIONS
A variable pattern of depressive symptom severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern related to decline in executive function-attention. Findings could signal differences in underlying neuropathologic processes among persons with differing depression patterns and late-life cognitive decline.

2272,"CONTEXT
Medical educators often have prior and primary experience in other academic and clinical disciplines. Individuals seeking successful careers in the education of medical students and doctors must, at some point in their development, make a conscious transition into a new identity as a medical educator. This is a necessary move if individuals are to commit to acquiring and maintaining specialist expertise in medical education. Some achieve this transition successfully, whereas others struggle and may even lose interest and abandon the endeavour. We explored senior educators' experiences of achieving the transition into medical education and their views on what helps and what hinders the process.


METHODS
In 2015 we conducted three focus groups with 15 senior medical educators. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied transition theory to guide our deductive analysis, using Schlossberg's Four S (4S) framework to code and report participants' self-reported perceptions of those factors relating to Self, Situation, Support and Strategy that had assisted them to make a successful transition to a fully acknowledged medical educator identity. Through inductive analysis, we then identified 17 explanatory sub-themes common to all three focus groups.


RESULTS
Background and circumstances, individual motivation, a sense of control, organisational support, and effective networking and information-seeking behaviour were factors identified as contributing to successful transition into, and maintenance of, a strong self-identity as a medical educator.


CONCLUSIONS
The experiences of established medical educators and, in particular, an exploration of the factors that have facilitated their transition to an acknowledged self-identity as a medical educator could assist in supporting new educators to cope with the changes involved in developing as a medical educator.",England,Medical education,29193365,2017,Making the leap to medical education: a qualitative study of medical educators' experiences.,y

To describe what and why nurses self-disclose to patients in mental health care.


BACKGROUND
Self-disclosure is common, but controversial and difficult to delineate. Extant research suggests that self-disclosure might have several potentially beneficial effects on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome for patients in mental health care, but results are often mixed and limited by definitional inconsistencies.


METHOD
Qualitative descriptive study including data from 16 nurses taking part in participant observation, individual interviews and focus group interviews.


RESULTS
Separate analyses resulted in four themes addressing the research question of what nurses self-disclose, and one main theme and four subthemes addressing why nurses self-disclose. The content of self-disclosure was captured in the four themes: Immediate family, Interests and activities, Life experiences, and Identity. In addition, results showed that disclosures were common among the nurses. Self-disclosure's potential to transform the nurse-patient relationship, making it more open, honest, close, reciprocal and equal, was the overarching reason why nurses shared personal information. The nurses also chose to self-disclose to share existential and everyday sentiments, to give real-life advice, because it felt natural and responsive to patients' question to do so.


CONCLUSION
Nurse self-disclosure is common and covers a variety of personal information. Nurses have several reasons for choosing to self-disclose, most of which are connected to improving the nurse-patient relationship.

To evaluate the effects of the implementation of a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings.


BACKGROUND
Care in long-term residential settings for older people is moving away from the biomedical approach and adopting a more person-centred one. Narrative can help shape the way care is planned and organised. The provision of person-centred care that is holistic and that takes account of resident's beliefs and values can be enhanced by incorporating narrative approaches to care within a practice development framework.


DESIGN
The chosen methodology was participatory action research.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2014, a methodological framework of narrative practice was implemented in two residential care settings, comprising 37 residents and 38 staff, using an action research approach. Three action cycles: (i) narrative practice and culture identification, (ii) developing narrative practice and (iii) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation.


RESULTS
Key outcomes emerged in relation to the findings. These were based on narrative being, knowing and doing and centred around the key outcomes of: (i) how people responded to change (narrative being), (ii) the development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and (iii) intentional action (narrative doing).


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a framework of narrative practice demonstrated that how people respond to change, the development of shared understandings and intentional action were interrelated and interlinked. It illustrated the importance of ensuring that practice context is taken account of in the implementation of action research and the importance of ensuring that narrative being, knowing and doing are clear and understandable for change to occur.

The two smaller groups represented different types of poly-victimization-a non-parental and a long-term parental victimization group.

In England and Wales, 'approved premises' offer 24-hour staffed accommodation for high-risk offenders, most of whom are returning to the community from prison. With a move towards a standardised operating model, it is essential to be able to measure outcomes.


AIMS
Our aim is to collate and evaluate 'benchmarks' for approved premises.


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to establish the impact of existing practice in all four approved premises in Wales. Data on well-being, life satisfaction, attitudes to violence and problem-solving abilities were recorded with 114 male residents (of 486), and attitudes to personality disorder and personal well-being/burnout with 30 staff (of 86), in both narrative style and according to a number of scales used within criminal justice and healthcare systems. Perceptions of environmental climate were assessed with both groups. Scores were compared with those from reference groups, including prisoners and secure hospital patients. Criminological outcomes (e.g. prison recall) were obtained for all 486 men.


RESULTS
Scores on the scales used were broadly comparable with those in relevant reference groups, but some showed floor or ceiling effects. Recall rates, whether directly from the premises or after further onward movement, were about 42% overall, comparable with those reported for similar offenders elsewhere.

2278,"The present review examines the relations between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children and adolescents. The review begins with a detailed discussion of normative developmental trends in sleep, and the relation between sleep quality and emotion dysregulation in children. The extant literature on sleep disturbance in clinically anxious children with a focus on subjective versus objective measures of sleep is then summarized in detail. Finally, a review of the reciprocal relationship between sleep and emotion regulation is provided. The available research suggests that sleep disturbance is quite prevalent in children with anxiety disorders, although the directionality of the association between sleep disturbance and anxiety in children remains unclear. Despite this limitation, a reciprocal relationship between sleep quality and anxiety appears to be well established. Research using objective measures of sleep quality (e.g. polysomnography, sleep actigraphy, sleep bruxism) is warranted to better understand this relation. Further, complicating factors such as the environment in which sleep quality is measured, the developmental stage of participants, varying severity of anxiety and the timeframe during which assessment takes place should all be considered when examining sleep disturbance in this population.",England,Journal of sleep research,29193443,2017,A review of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with anxiety.,y
2279,"A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16Â years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents. Key Practitioner Message The adoption status (but not attachment representations) was found to be predictive of externalizing and total behaviour problems, suggesting that attachment itself is not the only variable to take into account in explaining possible maladaptive outcomes in late-adopted adolescents. Nevertheless, disorganized attachment positively predicted internalizing problems, being a risk factor for both adopted and nonadopted adolescents. Only for late-adopted adolescents, higher cognitive reappraisal was negatively related with externalizing problems, suggesting that the functional and positive ability to cognitively restructure negative situations may help them to reduce impulsive negative reactions towards others. Both increasing cognitive reappraisal and decreasing expressive suppression may be considered as valuable goals of therapy with adopted adolescents and their parents. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadopted peers, reported lower somatic complaints, suggesting that they may not allow themselves to show physical vulnerability as consequence of their early affective experiences of severe deprivation. Late-adopted adolescents, compared to nonadoptedÂ ones, reported higher level of expressive suppression strategies, which may be considered as an attempt to beÂ compliant with the environment's requests in order to be loved, accepted, and nurtured.",England,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,29193445,2017,Late-adoptions in adolescence: Can attachment and emotion regulation influence behaviour problems?

In total, 35.1% had apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) <Â 5 (no OSA), 31.9% had AHI: 5-14.9 (mild OSA), 17.3% had AHI: 15-29.9 (moderate OSA) and 15.7% had AHI â‰¥Â 30 (severe OSA). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were significantly lower with increased OSA severity, and also when adjusting for sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity (AHI â‰¥Â 15 as dependent variable). Similarly, currently being in treatment for mental disorders and being diagnosed previously with depression were both associated negatively with OSA severity, with only the latter remaining significant in the fully adjusted model. Furthermore, multiple linear regressions showed that HADS anxiety and depression total scores were associated negatively with AHI. In conclusion, symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated negatively with OSA severity in these referred patients.

2281,"BACKGROUND
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence following gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recently, more and more attentions are being focused on gut microbiota in brain and behavior. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is considered as a mediator that links the gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Clostridium butyricum (Cb) on brain damage in a mouse model of TBI.


METHODS
Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a model of TBI-induced by weight-drop impact head injury and were treated intragastrically with Cb.Â The cognitive deficits, brain water content, neuronal death, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) in the brain were also measured.Â Moreover, the intestinal barrier permeability, the expression of TJ protein and GLP-1, and IL-6 level in the intestine were detected.


RESULTS
Cb treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, brain edema, neurodegeneration, and BBB impairment. Meanwhile, Cb treatment also significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins (occludin and zonula occluden-1), p-Akt and Bcl-2, but decreased expression of Bax. Moreover, Cb treatment exhibited more prominent effects on decreasing the levels of plasma d-lactate and colonic IL-6, upregulating expression of Occludin, and protecting intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, Cb-treatedÂ mice showed increased the secretion of intestinal GLP-1 and upregulated expression of cerebral GLP-1R.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Cb in TBI mice and the involved mechanisms were partially attributed to the elevating GLP-1 secretion through the gut-brain axis.",England,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,29193450,2017,Clostridium butyricum exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury via the gut-brain axis.,y
2282,"In the retina, MÃ¼ller glia have the potential to become progenitor cells with the ability to proliferate and regenerate neurons. However, the ability of MÃ¼ller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) to proliferate and produce neurons is limited in higher vertebrates. Using the chick model system, we investigate how retinoic acid (RA)-signaling influences the proliferation and the formation of MGPCs. We observed an upregulation of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABP) in the MÃ¼ller glia of damaged retinas where the formation of MGPCs is known to occur. Activation of RA-signaling was stimulated, whereas inhibition suppressed the proliferation of MGPCs in damaged retinas and in fibroblast growth factor 2-treated undamaged retinas. Furthermore, inhibition of RA-degradation stimulated the proliferation of MGPCs. Levels of Pax6, Klf4, and cFos were upregulated in MGPCs by RA agonists and downregulated in MGPCs by RA antagonists. Activation of RA-signaling following MGPC proliferation increased the percentage of progeny that differentiated as neurons. Similarly, the combination of RA and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) significantly increased neurogenesis from retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ). In summary, RA-signaling stimulates the formation of proliferating MGPCs and enhances the neurogenic potential of MGPCs and stem cells in the CMZ.

2283,"OBJECTIVE
Validate the Parkinson's disease (PD) composite scale (PDCS).


METHODS
The study included One hundred ninety four PD patients in five countries. Investigators completed the following scales: PDCS, MDS-UPDRS, PDSS-2, MoCA, WOK-19, SEND-PD and CISI-PD. For test-retest analysis, a second administration of the PDCS was carried out in 61 stable patients (as per the CISI-PD) in 7 to 14 days after the first evaluation. The PDCS is a novel scale for PD with a total of 17 items divided in 4 domains: motor, non-motor, treatment complication and disability.


RESULTS
PDCS mean and median values were close. Skewness values were into the criterion limits (-1 to +1). The complete range of scores was covered for 14 of the 17 items (83.4%). Floor effect of 25.26% and 28.25% were observed in the Complication and Disability level dimensions due to the proportion of patients free of these difficulties. No relevant floor or ceiling effect was observed for the PDCS Total Score (1.03% and 0.52%, respectively). The stability of the scale appeared excellent with most items meeting weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient values >0.80. The convergent validity of the PDCS with corresponding scores of the MDS-UPDRS showed high correlation values (rS â‰¥0.60). The internal validity was into acceptable limits, with the majority of values higher than the minimal 0.30 threshold. The standard error of measurement suggested a satisfactory precision (SEM=3.81, <30% of the PDCS total score standard deviation).

2284,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism. The phenotypic expression of the disease may, in part, relate to alterations in functional connectivity within and between brain networks. This resting-state study sought to clarify this in DLB, how networks differed from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and whether they were related to clinical symptoms in DLB. Resting-state networks were estimated using independent component analysis. We investigated functional connectivity changes in 31 DLB patients compared to 31 healthy controls and a disease comparator group of 29 AD patients using dual regression and FSLNets. Within-network connectivity was generally decreased in DLB compared to controls, mainly in motor, temporal, and frontal networks. Between-network connectivity was mainly intact; only the connection between a frontal and a temporal network showed increased connectivity in DLB. Differences between AD and DLB were subtle and we did not find any significant correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms in DLB. This study emphasizes the importance of reduced connectivity within motor, frontal, and temporal networks in DLB with relative sparing of the default mode network. The lack of significant correlations between connectivity measures and clinical scores indicates that the observed reduced connectivity within these networks might be related to the presence, but not to the severity of motor and cognitive impairment in DLB patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that AD and DLB may show more similarities than differences in patients with mild disease.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193464,2017,Functional connectivity in dementia with Lewy bodies: A within- and between-network analysis.,y

In Experiment 1, 5- and 6-year-old children consumed more of a food described as popular with other children than a food that was described as unpopular with other children, even though the two foods were identical. In Experiment 2, children ate more of a food described as popular with children than a food described as popular with adults. Experiment 3 tested whether different perceptual experiences of otherwise identical foods contributed to the mechanisms underlying children's consumption. After sampling both endpoints of a sweet-to-sour range (applesauce with 0 mL or 5mL of lemon juice added), children were asked to taste and categorize applesauce samples with varying amounts of lemon juice added. When classifying ambiguous samples that were near the midpoint of the range (2 mL and 3 mL), children were more likely to categorize popular foods as sweet as compared to unpopular foods. Together, these findings provide evidence that social information plays a powerful role in guiding children's consumption and perception of foods.

To investigate the feasibility of a 13-week mentoring program in providing social support to promote hope for recovery in anorexia nervosa.


BACKGROUND
With no clear first line psychological treatment for people with anorexia nervosa, mentoring support programs, as an adjunct to treatment, may provide the social support necessary to promote hope for recovery.


DESIGN
A mixed method study; Participatory action research.


METHODS
Women (n=11), recovering and who had recovered from anorexia nervosa, participated in the program and completed self-report questionnaires related to quality of life, distress and the mentoring relationship at different time points. Qualitative feedback from logbooks, workshop evaluation questionnaires, interviews and focus groups was also collected to assess the program's acceptability.


RESULTS
General compliance for completing most study outcome questionnaires was 90% however the mentoring relationship questionnaires were not completed to the same degree. Five key themes emerged from the focus group/interview data: 1) She understands me and could relate to me; 2) Re-connecting with the world - Asking questions and being challenged; 3) Mentors' altruistic motivations and the transformation and discovery of self; 4) Instilling hope - Recovery is possible; and 5) Effective communication - The key to successful mentoring.


CONCLUSIONS
Further research is needed however the results provide preliminary support for the mentoring program's feasibility as an adjunct to treatment. We found that having someone who understands, to talk and share with, met a clear need for people with anorexia nervosa.

2287,"Stroke patients with motor deficits typically feature enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, also healthy subjects may show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with higher motor demands. Therefore, the question arises to what extent stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural reorganization. We here investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable the flexible adaption to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies performed with the affected/right or unaffected/left hand. In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1) but unlike in healthy controls also in contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Connectivity analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of right SPL onto affected/left M1 in patients but not in controls when moving the affected/right hand independent of the movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of right SPL was positively coupled with the ""active"" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency. In summary, these findings are compatible with a supportive role of right SPL with respect to motor function of the paretic hand in the reorganized brain.",United States,Human brain mapping,29193484,2017,Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients.,y

In the era of neurological subspecialization, most neurologists will have a field of specialist interest. The aim of this cross-sectional multi-national study was to identify the key areas of interest among trainees or junior specialists, assess the potential influence of an interest in research, and consider the results in light of population needs.


METHODS
A total of 300 residents and junior neurologists who received a bursary to attend the European Academy of Neurology conference were invited to participate in this study. Demographic and work-related characteristics, as well as main subspecialty of choice were examined via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Participants holding a higher degree (PhD/MD) or working in research posts were considered research oriented.


RESULTS
In total, 191 Neurologists in training or junior specialists responded (response rate 63.7%). Full data were available for 187 participants (59.4% females). The study sample had a mean age of 30.5Â±3.4 years (range 25 - 45). The most popular subspecialty was movement disorders (18.2%), followed by multiple sclerosis (11.2%) and epilepsy (10.2%). This did not differ significantly between the participants who were or were not research-oriented.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a potential mismatch between the interests of trainees, and the future needs of the populations they serve, which it is important to identify for workforce planning.

No studies have focused on socioeconomic disparities in obesity within and between cohorts. Our objectives were to examine income gradients in obesity between birth-cohorts (inter-cohort variations) and within each birth-cohort (intra-cohort variations) by gender and race/ethnicity.


METHODS
Our sample includes 56,820 white and black adults from pooled, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1971-2012). We fit a series of logistic hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models to control for the effects of age and period, simultaneously. Predicted probabilities of obesity by poverty-to-income ratio were estimated and graphed for 5-year cohort groups from 1901-1990. We also stratified this relationship for four gender and racial/ethnic subgroups.


RESULTS
Obesity disparities due to income were weaker for post-World War I and II generations, specifically the mid-1920s and the mid-1940s to 1950s cohorts, than for other cohorts. In contrast, we found greater income gradients in obesity among cohorts from the 1930s to mid-1940s and mid-1960s to 1970s. Moreover, obesity disparities due to income across cohorts vary markedly by gender and race/ethnicity. White women with higher income consistently exhibited a lower likelihood of obesity than those with lower income since early 1900s cohorts; whereas, black men with higher income exhibited higher risks of obesity than those with lower income in most cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that strategies that address race and/or gender inequalities in obesity should be cognizant of significant historical factors that may be unique to cohorts. Period-based approaches that ignore life-course experiences captured in significant cohort-based experiences may limit the utility of policies and interventions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193504,2017,Cohort-based income gradients in obesity among U.S. adults.,y
2291,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
This study proposed and tested a structural model to explain and predict family empowerment in families of children with special needs.


BACKGROUND
Family empowerment of families of children with special needs can be explained using the Double ABCX model. Although constant stressors such as parenting stress and family demands can have negative effects on family empowerment, family resources and parenting efficacy can mediate the negative effect through effective coping strategies.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional research design was employed.


METHODS
A survey was conducted with 240 parents of children with special needs. Upon exclusion of 4 responses deemed inadequate to the statistics process, 236 responses were selected for the analysis. Based on the items used in the previous research, we used the scale of family demands 38, the scale of parenting stress 24, the scale of parenting efficacy 37, the scale of pattern of organization 30, the scale of communication process 16, and the scale of family empowerment 32.


RESULTS
In families of children with special needs, parenting stress had a negative effect on parenting efficacy and family resources, namely, pattern of organization and communication process. Family needs had a positive effect on parenting efficacy. Parenting stress and family demands influenced family empowerment through parenting efficacy and family resources (pattern of organization and communication process), while parenting efficacy contributed to family empowerment.


CONCLUSIONS
This study empirically analyzed the usefulness of the Double ABCX model in predicting family empowerment. Family resource factors (organization pattern and communication process) and perception or judgement factors (such as parenting efficacy) were found to mediate the negative impact of various stressors experienced by families of children with special needs.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study findings suggest that clinical practice and management should focus on providing efficient intervention methods to lower stress in families of children with special needs. Reinforcing factors contributing to family empowerment, such as parenting efficacy, organization pattern, and communication process will alleviate families' stress, resulting in a positive educational and developmental impact on children with special needs.

2292,"Neurogenesis encompasses an entire set of events that leads to the generation of newborn neurons from neural stem cells and more committed progenitor cells, including cell division, the production of migratory precursors and their progeny, differentiation and integration into circuits. In particular, the precise control of neuronal migration and morphological changes is essential for the development of the neocortex. Postmitotic cells within the intermediate zone have been found to transiently assume a characteristic ""multipolar"" morphology, after which a multipolar-to-bipolar transition occurs before the cells enter the cortical plate; however, the importance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical cytoarchitecture and the precise genetic control of this phase remains largely unknown. Thus, this review article focuses on the multipolar phase in the developing neocortex. It begins by summarizing the molecular mechanism that underlies multipolar migration for the regulation of each step in multipolar phase in intermediate zone. The physiological significance of this multipolar phase in the establishment of mature cortical lamination and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with migration defects is then described.",England,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,29193520,2017,Physiological significance of multipolar cells generated from neural stem cells and progenitors for the establishment of neocortical cytoarchitecture.,y

To analyze whether living conditions, experienced by mothers and adult daughters during their childhood, are associated with age at menarche (AAM) in daughters.


METHODS
From September, 2011, to January, 2014, AAM and childhood living conditions were collected from a sample of 246 dyads of Maya mothers (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰59.60 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰8.64) and their adult daughters (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰33.03 years, SDâ€‰=â€‰5.57) from the cities of Merida and Motul in Yucatan, Mexico. Indicators of childhood living conditions were number of siblings and quality of house construction materials in both generations, and father's absence among daughters in their pre-menarcheal years. Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between childhood conditions in mother-daughter dyads and daughter's AAM.


RESULTS
The recalled mean AAM of adult Maya daughters was 12.05 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰1.53). After adjusting for the influence of mothers' AAM, number of siblings in both the mothers' and daughters' families directly predicted daughters' AAM (more siblings was associated with a later AAM); and a higher (better) index of household conditions in mothers' childhood was associated with earlier AAM in daughters. The household conditions index during the childhood of daughters and father's absence were not associated with their AAM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that better living conditions experienced by the mothers and daughters during their childhood may lower mean AAM in daughters in the context of populations that show important intergenerational changes in their social and economic conditions.",United States,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,29193533,2017,"Living conditions and change in age of menarche in adult Maya mothers and daughters from Yucatan, Mexico.",y
2294,"Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, 'boom-and-bust' demography, hybridization, and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure, and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation, and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C. santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C. santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker, and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses' perspectives of language barriers and their impact on the provision of care to patients with limited English proficiency from diverse linguistic background.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Using individual interviews and focus group discussions, data were collected from 59 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals in England. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.


FINDINGS
Three themes: 'multi-ethnicities and language barriers'; 'the impact of language barriers'; and 'communicating via interpreters', were identified. Communication was identified as the most important aspect of care provision and an essential component of a nurse's professional role regardless of the clinical area or speciality. Language barriers were identified as the biggest obstacles in providing adequate, appropriate, effective and timely care to patients with limited English proficiency. Use of professional interpreters was considered useful; however, the limitations associated with use of interpretation service, including arrangement difficulties, availability and accessibility of interpreters, convenience, confidentiality and privacy related issues and impact on the patient's comfort were mentioned.


CONCLUSION
Language barriers, in any country or setting, can negatively affect nurses' ability to communicate effectively with their patients and thereby have a negative impact on the provision of appropriate, timely, safe and effective care to meet patient's needs.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
An understanding of language barriers can help nurses find appropriate strategies to overcome such barriers and, consequently, enhance the provision of effective care to patients affected by language barriers in any clinical setting in any health care system.

This study reports on the committee's ability to achieve these goals.


PROCEDURE
An online survey was sent to YIs who were registered with the program from 2004 to2015, assessing three major domains: (1) overall experience with the mentor pairing, (2) satisfaction with the program, and (3) academic accomplishments of the mentees.


RESULTS
The response rate was 64% (110/171). Overall, YIs rated the success of their mentorship pairing as 7.2 out of 10 (median) (25th, 75th quartile 3.6, 9.6). The direct effects of the mentorship program included 70% YIs reporting a positive effect on their career, 40% reporting any grant or manuscript resulting from the pairing, 47% forming a new research collaboration, and 43% receiving appointment to a COG committee. Respondents reported success in COG with 38% authoring a manuscript on behalf of COG and 65% reporting a leadership position including seven current or past COG discipline chairs and 20 study chairs.

A method of real-time, accurate probe tracking at the entrance of the MRI bore is developed, which, fused with pre-procedural MR images, will enable clinicians to perform cryoablation efficiently in a large workspace with image guidance.


METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) tracking coupled with optical tracking is used to track the probe. EM tracking is achieved with an MRI-safe EM sensor working under the scanner's magnetic field to compensate the line-of-sight issue of optical tracking. Unscented Kalman filter-based probe tracking is developed to smooth the EM sensor measurements when occlusion occurs and to improve the tracking accuracy by fusing the measurements of two sensors.


RESULTS
Experiments with a spine phantom show that the mean targeting errors using the EM sensor alone and using the proposed method are 2.21Â mm and 1.80Â mm, respectively.

To describe sleep patterns in young children with epilepsy and to examine levels of agreement between measurements derived from actigraphy and diary recordings.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


METHODS
Eighty-nine toddlers and preschool-aged children with epilepsy wore an actigraph on their wrists for 7 consecutive days. Parents and caregivers maintained a concurrent sleep diary while the child was wearing the monitor. Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends.


FINDINGS
Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were Â±35, Â±15, Â±82, Â±70, and Â±29 min, respectively. Differences between actigraphy and diary-derived sleep variables were consistently greater for weekends than for weekdays. Discrepancies between actigraphy and diary-derived actual sleep at night were significantly greater for children who slept alone than for those who co-slept with a parent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates an acceptable agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings for sleep onset, sleep offset, and daytime sleep, but insufficient agreement for actual sleep at night and wake after sleep onset, with parents of children sleeping alone more likely to misestimate child sleep behaviors. Deviation of weekend sleep from weekdays further decreased the accuracy of parental sleep estimates and increased the discrepancies between actigraphy and diary.

A new undergraduate laboratory class for developmental biology was developed in order to offer students the opportunity to explore a wide range of experimental procedures, also incorporating the instructor's on-going research. Thereby the course can serve as a bridge between research and education by combining both into a single theme. The course design involves a sequence of exercises which can be easily adapted to the faculty's ongoing research. This style of laboratory coursework could be a transitional form between a regular laboratory course and a discovery-based laboratory course.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on brain magnetic resonance imaging, represent an abnormality related to the development of geriatric syndromes. Recently, it has been found that low sympathetic nervous activity might be associated with physical and cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the severity of cerebral WMH and sympathetic nervous activity, measured by the heart rate variability.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 39 older patients. Holter recording was carried out for 30 min. From the RR intervals on the electrocardiogram, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals, the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in all the five segments of the entire recording, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF were calculated. In regard to the WMH, periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were rated according to the Fazekas classification. The WMH were also rated semiquantitatively according to the methods developed by Junque (periventricular hyperintensities) and de Groot (DWMH).


RESULTS
The LF/HF showed significant negative correlations with the total and regional periventricular hyperintensities, as well as DWMH. Multiple regression analysis showed that the negative associations remained significant between the LF/HF and DWMH (total, temporal, occipital). Furthermore, fall risk index significantly correlated with the LF/HF, total and the occipital DWMH.


CONCLUSIONS
The severity of the DWMH was associated with the LF/HF and the fall risk, one of the important geriatric syndromes, suggesting that WMH, sympathetic nervous dysfunction and geriatric syndrome are interrelated to each other.

2303,"PURPOSE
Displacement is traumatic and often an unwanted social change that can lead to a loss of identity and socioeconomic, physical, and psychological livelihood. The purpose of the study was to describe the association of perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness to depressive symptom severity in Palestinian refugees, taking into consideration gender and poverty.


DESIGN
The descriptive, correlational study was framed within a socioecological lens. Data collection occurred between October 2015 and November 2015 in Amman, Jordan, which hosts the most Palestinian refugees in the world. The participants in the sample (N = 177) had a mean age of 36.9 years.


METHODS
Participants responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptom severity, the RAND-36 perceived health item, and a statement about hopefulness to return to Palestine. Descriptive, correlation, and logistic and linear regression analyses were computed.


FINDINGS
Results showed that 43% of participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 42% lived in poverty, and 20% had fair or poor health; yet, 60% were hopeful about returning to Palestine. Participants who had better perceived health and right-of-return hopefulness were less likely to have symptoms of major depression. Perceived health was the only factor-not gender, poverty, or right-of-return hopefulness-that explained the variance in depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Palestinian adult refugees in Jordan exhibited symptoms of major depression that were associated with poorer perceived health and less hopefulness about repatriation to Palestine.

Mental health nursing is a concept that has lost any real explanatory or conceptual power, yet nevertheless persists in public discourse and the collective imagination. In recent decades, powerful forces have contributed to the zombification of the mental health nursing workforce and the academy. An increase in medical hegemony, the ascendancy of allied health in mental health service provision, the need for uncritical and servile workers, protocol-driven work practices, and a failure of leadership to mobilize any substantial resistance to these trends have enabled the infection to spread.

Many older adults face limitations to participating in active leisure activities as a result of their physical constraints from aging. Passive leisure activities become alternative leisure activities for older adults as a result of limited physical capacity. The present study sought to determine whether there exists a difference in the frequency of participation in passive and active leisure activities, and the effect of participation in passive and active leisure activities on the life satisfaction level of old adults.


METHODS
A total of 460 participants aged 60-95â€‰years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index - Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities.


RESULTS
The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), homemaking/maintenance (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and traveling (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index - Z for older adults.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates. The current study suggests marketing and programming plans to overcome the constraints that influence older adults' life satisfaction.

Little is known about the role of PRS in densely affected multigenerational families. We tested PRS differences between affected SZ and BD family members from their non-affected adult relatives (NAARs) in Eastern Quebec Kindreds and from controls. We examined 1227 subjects: from 17 SZ and BD kindreds, we studied 153 patients (57 SZ, 13 schizoaffective, and 83 BD) and 180 NAARs, and 894 unrelated controls from the Eastern Quebec population. PRS were derived from published case-control association studies of SZ and BD. We also constructed a combined SZ and BD PRS by using SNPs from both SZ and BD PRS. SZ patients had higher SZ PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0039, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027) and BD patients had higher BD PRS than controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013, R2 â€‰=â€‰0.027). Differences between affected subjects and NAARs and controls were significant with both SZ and BD PRS.

Dietary cholesterol has been shown to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed that oxysterol especially 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) may play a potential role in Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) production and accumulation during AD progression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To investigate the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol and 27-OHC on learning and memory impairment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with cholesterol diet with or without 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole) injection. We determined the levels of cholesterol, 27-OHC, 24S-OHC, 7Î±-OHC and 7Î²-OHC in plasma; ApoA, ApoB, HDL-C and LDL-C in plasma or brain; CYP27A1 and CYP7A1 in liver and CYP46A1 and CYP7B1 in brain; cathepsin B, cathepsin D and acid phosphatase in lysosome; AÎ²1-40 and AÎ²1-42 in brain. Results showed increased levels of 27-OHC (PÂ <Â 0.01), LDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.01), ApoB (PÂ <Â 0.01) and decreased level of HDL-C (PÂ <Â 0.05) in plasma, upregulated CYP27A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) and CYP7A1 (PÂ <Â 0.01) expression in liver, altered lysosomal function and increased level of AÎ² in brain (PÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
This study indicated that the mechanisms of dietary cholesterol on learning and memory impairment may be involved in cholesterol metabolism and lysosome function with the increase of plasma 27-OHC, thus resulting in AÎ² formation and accumulation.

2308,"Recent studies showed cultural worldviews are a key determinant of environmental risk perceptions; thus, they could influence climate change adaptation strategies. African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45 % of agro-pastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a compliment to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation.

Strengthening neighborhood social networks is important for promoting health among older adults. However, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing older adults' social networks have not yet been established. The present study examined whether a university-led community intervention that provided communication opportunities could increase older Japanese adults' neighborhood social networks.


METHODS
The present study used a quasi-experimental design. Before the intervention, using postal mail, we carried out a baseline questionnaire survey that was sent to all people living in the Tsurukabuto community aged â‰¥60â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰1769), of whom 1068 responded. For the community intervention, 18 event-based programs were provided over the course of 1â€‰year at Kobe University. Academic staff at Kobe University organized all the programs. During the program, social interactions among participants were promoted. A follow-up survey was distributed to those who responded to the baseline survey, and 710 individuals answered the question about their participation in the intervention programs (138 respondents were participants, 572 were non-participants). The neighborhood social network was measured in both the baseline and follow-up surveys.


RESULTS
Analysis of covariance showed that the changes in neighborhood social network among participants in the program was significantly higher than the changes among non-participants (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046) after adjusting for the baseline score of social network.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study found that participants of the intervention expanded their neighborhood social network, but non-participants did not.

2310,"Neural crest cells (NCC) can migrate into different parts of the body and express their strong inductive potential. In addition, they are multipotent and are able to differentiate into various cell types with diverse functions. In the primitive gut, NCC induce differentiation of muscular structures and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and they themselves differentiate into the elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), neurons and glial cells. ICC develop by way of mesenchymal cell differentiation in the outer parts of the primitive gut wall around the myenteric plexus (MP) ganglia, with the exception of colon, where they appear simultaneously also at the submucosal border of the circular muscular layer around the submucosal plexus (SMP) ganglia. However, in a complex process of reciprocal induction of NCC and local mesenchyma, c-kit positive precursors are the first to differentiate, representing probably the common precursors of ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). C-kit positive precursors could represent a key impact factor regarding the final differentiation of NCC into neurons and glial cells with neurons subsequently excreting stem cell factor (SCF) and other signalling molecules. Under the impact of SCF, a portion of c-kit positive precursors lying immediately around the ganglia differentiate into ICC, while the rest differentiate into SMC.",England,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,29193736,2017,Development of interstitial cells of Cajal in the human digestive tract as the result of reciprocal induction of mesenchymal and neural crest cells.,y
2311,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A.

2312,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity for comparing multiple treatments in a single analysis. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a unifying framework for NMA, allow us to analyze datasets with dichotomous, continuous or count endpoints, and take into account multi-arm trials, potential heterogeneity between trials and network inconsistency. To perform inference within such NMA models, the use of Bayesian methods is often advocated. The standard inference tool is Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC), which is computationally expensive and requires convergence diagnostics. A deterministic approach to do fully Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs) can be achieved by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which is a fast and accurate alternative to MCMC. We show how NMA models fit in the class of LGMs, how NMA models are implemented using INLA and demonstrate that the estimates obtained by INLA are in close agreement with the ones obtained by MCMC. Specifically, we emphasize the design-by-treatment interaction model with random inconsistency parameters (also known as the Jackson model). Also, we have proposed a network meta-regression model which is constructed by incorporating trial-level covariates to the Jackson model in order to explain possible sources of heterogeneity and/or inconsistency in the network. A publicly available R package, nmaINLA, is developed to automate the INLA implementation of NMA models which are considered in this paper.

Measures of social attention, assessed via eye-gaze tracking (EGT), have been proposed as an early efficacy biomarker for clinical trials targeting social communication skills. EGT measures have been shown to differentiate children with ASD from typical children; however, there is less known about their relationships with social communication outcome measures that are typically used in ASD clinical trials. In the present study, an EGT task involving viewing a videotape of an actor making bids for a child's attention was evaluated in 25 children with ASD aged 24-72 months. Children's attention to the actor during the dyadic bid condition measured via EGT was found to be strongly associated with five well-validated caregiver-reported outcome measures that are commonly used to assess social communication in clinical trials. These results highlight the convergent validity of EGT measures of social attention in relation to caregiver-reported clinical measures.

2314,"Neuropsychiatric disorders in which reduced social interest is a common symptom, such as autism, depression, and anxiety, are frequently associated with genetic mutations affecting GABAergic transmission. Benzodiazepine treatment, acting via GABAA receptors, improves social interaction in male mouse models with autism-like features. The protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) can act as an endogenous benzodiazepine, but a role for DBI in social behavior has not been described. Here we investigated the role of DBI in the social interest and recognition behavior of mice. The responses of DBI wild-type and knockout male and female mice to ovariectomized female wild-type mice (a neutral social stimulus) were evaluated in a habituation/dishabituation task. Both male and female knockout mice exhibited reduced social interest, and DBI knockout mice lacked the sex difference in social interest levels observed in wild-type mice, in which males showed higher social interest levels than females. The ability to discriminate between familiar and novel stimulus mice (social recognition) was not impaired in DBI-deficient mice of either sex. DBI knockouts could learn a rotarod motor task, and could discriminate between social and non-social odors. Both sexes of DBI knockout mice showed increased repetitive grooming behavior, but not in a manner that would account for the decrease in social investigation time. Genetic loss of DBI did not alter seminal vesicle weight, indicating that the social interest phenotype of males lacking DBI is not due to reduced circulating testosterone. Together, these studies reveal a novel role of DBI in driving social interest and motivation.",England,"Genes, brain, and behavior",29193847,2017,Genetic loss of diazepam binding inhibitor in mice impairs social interest.,y

2316,"Currently, the predominant hypothesis explains cellular differentiation and behaviour as an essentially genetically driven intracellular process, suggesting a gene-centrism paradigm. However, although many living species genetic has now been described, there is still a large gap between the genetic information interpretation and cell behaviour prediction. Indeed, the physical mechanisms underlying the cell differentiation and proliferation, which are now known or suspected to guide such as the flow of energy through cells and tissues, have been often overlooked. We thus here propose a complementary conceptual framework towards the development of an energy-oriented classification of cell properties, that is, a mitochondria-centrism hypothesis based on physical forces-driven principles. A literature review on the physical-biological interactions in a number of various biological processes is analysed from the point of view of the fluid and solid mechanics, electricity and thermodynamics. There is consistent evidence that physical forces control cell proliferation and differentiation.

Treatments that stimulate adenosine A2A receptors may represent a promising approach for reducing RRBs in ASD. This is because A2A receptors are expressed on striatal neurons of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Under activation of this pathway has been associated with RRBs while activation of A2A receptors leads to increased activity of the indirect basal ganglia pathway. The present studies investigated whether acute, systemic treatment with CGS21680, an A2A receptor agonist attenuates elevated self-grooming and a probabilistic reversal learning deficit in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf /J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism. The effects of this treatment were also investigated in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as a comparison strain. Using a spatial reversal learning test with 80/20 probabilistic feedback, comparable to one in which ASD individuals exhibit deficits, CGS 21680 (0.005 and 0.01mg/kg) attenuated a reversal learning deficit in BTBR mice. Enhancement in probabilistic reversal learning performance resulted from CGS 21680 improving the consistent maintenance of new adaptive behavioral choice patterns after reversal. CGS 21680 at 0.01 mg, but not 0.005 mg, also reduced self-grooming behavior in BTBR mice. CGS 21680 did not affect self-grooming or reversal learning in B6 mice.
