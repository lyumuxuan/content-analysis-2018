The impact of happy and angry faces on working memory in depressed adolescents.,"Recent cognitive models suggest that the ability to control emotional information
in working memory (WM) may be implicated in the etiology and maintenance of
depression. However, few studies have examined the effects of processing relevant
and irrelevant emotional stimuli on WM performance in depressed adolescents. In
the current study, depressed adolescents (n = 27) and healthy adolescents
(n = 49) completed two versions of an emotional n-back task: a low WM load
(0-back) task and a high WM load (2-back) task. In the emotion-relevant condition
participants were asked to attend to the emotional expression of an angry, happy,
or neutral face, whereas in the emotion-irrelevant condition participants were
asked to attend to the gender of the face. The results showed a WM improvement
for happy faces in the emotion-relevant condition and a WM impairment for happy
faces in the emotion-irrelevant condition for healthy adolescents but not for
depressed adolescents. No biases toward angry faces were found. These results
demonstrate that depressed adolescents do not show a preferential processing of
angry faces but rather fail to show a positivity bias as seen in healthy
adolescents. This supports the theoretical notion that a depressive disorder is
characterized by a blunted reactivity toward positive information and may provide
new insights into the underlying mechanisms of youth depression.",10.1016/j.jecp.2017.12.012 
"Using versus liking: Young children use ownership to predict actions but not to
infer preferences.","Three experiments show that young children (N = 384) use ownership to predict
actions but not to infer preferences. In Experiment 1, 3- to 6-year-olds
considered ownership when predicting actions but did not expect it to trump
preferences. In Experiment 2, 4- and 5-year-olds, but not 3-year-olds, used
ownership to predict actions, and 5-year-olds grasped that an agent would use his
or her own property despite preferring someone else's. This experiment also
showed that relating an agent to an object interfered with 3- and 4-year-olds'
judgments that a more attractive object is preferred. Finally, Experiment 3 found
that 3- and 4-year-olds do not believe that owning an object increases regard for
it. These findings are informative about the kinds of information children use to
predict actions and the inferences they make from ownership. The findings also
reveal specificity in how children use ownership to make judgments about others, 
and suggest that children more closely relate ownership to people's actions than 
to their desires.",10.1016/j.jecp.2017.12.007 
"Lateral asymmetry in the freely occurring behaviour of budgerigars (Melopsittacus
undulatus) and its relation to cognitive performance.
","USA.

Hemispheric laterality and its provision of potential fitness advantages to aves 
is a widespread topic of research in budgerigars and other parrot species [e.g., 
Magat, M. & Brown, C. (2009). Laterality enhances cognition in Australian
parrots. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276,
4155-4162]. In the current study, lateral preferences were tracked for 11
captive-reared budgerigars that subsequently underwent 2 cognitive
problem-solving tests: a tool-use problem and a dig-discrimination task. Two
significant individual-level lateral preferences (a leftward unipedal support
preference and a rightward preening side preference) and 1 significant
population-level preference (a right-side preening preference) were obtained.
Lateral preening side preference indices for individual subjects correlated with 
various measures of performance on the dig task, such that right-side preening
preferences and stronger lateral preferences irrespective of direction were
associated with enhanced dig task performance. The data generally support the
idea that laterality in aves serves as a good predictor of increased cognitive
capability, while also offering new evidence for population-level lateral
preferences in the species.",10.1080/1357650X.2017.1361964 
Driven to distraction: A lack of change gives rise to mind wandering.,"How does the dynamic structure of the external world direct attention? We
examined the relationship between event structure and attention to test the
hypothesis that narrative shifts (both theoretical and perceived) negatively
predict attentional lapses. Self-caught instances of mind wandering were
collected while 108 participants watched a 32.5 min film called The Red Balloon. 
We used theoretical codings of situational change and human perceptions of event 
boundaries to predict mind wandering in 5-s intervals. Our findings suggest a
temporal alignment between the structural dynamics of the film and mind wandering
reports. Specifically, the number of situational changes and likelihood of
perceiving event boundaries in the prior 0-15 s interval negatively predicted
mind wandering net of low-level audiovisual features. Thus, mind wandering is
less likely to occur when there is more event change, suggesting that narrative
shifts keep attention from drifting inwards.",10.1016/j.cognition.2018.01.007 
"Do enhanced states exist? Boosting cognitive capacities through an action video-game
video-game.
","This research reports the existence of enhanced cognitive states in which
dramatic temporary improvements in temporal and spatial aspects of attention were
exhibited by participants who played (but not by those who merely observed)
action video-games meeting certain criteria. Specifically, Experiments 1 and 2
demonstrate that the attentional improvements were exhibited only by participants
whose skills matched the difficulty level of the video game. Experiment 2 showed 
that arousal (as reflected by the reduction in parasympathetic activity and
increase in sympathetic activity) is a critical physiological condition for
enhanced cognitive states and corresponding attentional enhancements. Experiment 
3 showed that the cognitive enhancements were transient, and were no longer
observed after 30 min of rest following video-gaming. Moreover, the results
suggest that the enhancements were specific to tasks requiring visual-spatial
focused attention, but not distribution of spatial attention as has been reported
to improve significantly and durably as a result of long-term video-game playing.
Overall, the results suggest that the observed enhancements cannot be simply due 
to the activity of video-gaming per se, but might rather represent an enhanced
cognitive state resulting from specific conditions (heightened arousal in
combination with active engagement and optimal challenge), resonant with what has
been described in previous phenomenological literature as ""flow""
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) or ""peak experiences"" (Maslov, 1962). The findings
provide empirical evidence for the existence of the enhanced cognitive states and
suggest possibilities for consciously accessing latent resources of our brain to 
temporarily boost our cognitive capacities upon demand.

"Voulez-vous jouer avec moi? Twelve-month-olds understand that foreign languages
can communicate.
","Infants understand that speech in their native language allows speakers to
communicate. Is this understanding limited to their native language or does it
extend to non-native languages with which infants have no experience?
Twelve-month-old infants saw an actor, the Communicator, repeatedly select one of
two objects. When the Communicator could no longer reach the target but a
Recipient could, the Communicator vocalized a nonsense phrase either in English
(infants' native language), Spanish (rhythmically different), or Russian
(phonotactically different), or hummed (a non-speech vocalization). Across all
three languages, native and non-native, but not humming, infants looked longer
when the Recipient gave the Communicator the non-target object. Although, by
12 months, infants do not readily map non-native words to objects or discriminate
most non-native speech contrasts, they understand that non-native languages can
transfer information to others. Understanding language as a tool for
communication extends beyond infants' native language: By 12 months, infants view
language as a universal mechanism for transferring and acquiring new information.

"Children exhibit different performance patterns in explicit and implicit theory
of mind tasks.","
Three studies tested scope and limits of children's implicit and explicit theory 
of mind. In Studies 1 and 2, three- to six-year-olds (N = 84) were presented with
closely matched explicit false belief tasks that differed in whether or not they 
required an understanding of aspectuality. Results revealed that children
performed equally well in the different tasks, and performance was strongly
correlated. Study 3 tested two-year-olds (N = 81) in implicit interactive
versions of these tasks and found evidence for dis-unity: children performed
competently only in those tasks that did not require an understanding of
aspectuality. Taken together, the present findings suggest that early implicit
and later explicit theory of mind tasks may tap different forms of cognitive
capacities.",10.1016/j.cognition.2018.01.001 
Rehabilitation in the real-life environment of a shopping mall.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how shopping malls could be used during
rehabilitation and to identify the facilitators and barriers to their use.
METHOD: Two focus groups, conducted with 15 rehabilitation professionals from
various disciplines and working with people with disabilities of all ages were
structured around two topics: (i) The usage of malls for rehabilitation and (ii) 
Factors that facilitate or limit rehabilitation professionals' use of the mall as
an environment for clinical assessment and/or intervention.
RESULTS: The thematic analysis revealed that shopping malls were used to achieve 
several rehabilitation goals targeting physical and cognitive skills,
psychological health and socialization. This real-life environment is motivating 
and helps foster independence and normalization. Factors affecting mall use
during rehabilitation included personal factors (e.g. clients' personality and
level of readiness) and environmental factors (e.g. clinical context,
accessibility of the mall and social attitudes of store owners).
CONCLUSION: Shopping malls may be a relevant rehabilitation assessment and
treatment environment that could contribute to optimizing community integration
of people with disabilities. Implications for rehabilitation To ensure successful
community reintegration, clients could be trained at some point during their
rehabilitation, to perform activities in real-life settings, such as a shopping
mall. Shopping malls appear to enable the attainment of rehabilitation goals
targeting a variety of skills. This real-life environment appears to be
motivating and helps foster independence and normalization. Factors felt to
affect mall use during rehabilitation include personal factors (e.g. clients'
personality and level of readiness) and environmental factors (e.g. clinical
context, accessibility of the mall and social attitudes of store owners). The
shopping mall may be an untapped resource as it appears to be a relevant
rehabilitation assessment and treatment environment that could contribute to
optimizing community integration of people with disabilities.",10.1080/09638288.2016.1277394 
"Positive effects of a computerised working memory and executive function training
on sentence comprehension in aphasia.
","Aphasia, the language disorder following brain damage, is frequently accompanied 
by deficits of working memory (WM) and executive functions (EFs). Recent studies 
suggest that WM, together with certain EFs, can play a role in sentence
comprehension in individuals with aphasia (IWA), and that WM can be enhanced with
intensive practice. Our aim was to investigate whether a combined WM and EF
training improves the understanding of spoken sentences in IWA. We used a
pre-post-test case control design. Three individuals with chronic aphasia
practised an adaptive training task (a modified n-back task) three to four times 
a week for a month. Their performance was assessed before and after the training 
on outcome measures related to WM and spoken sentence comprehension. One
participant showed significant improvement on the training task, another showed a
tendency for improvement, and both of them improved significantly in spoken
sentence comprehension. The third participant did not improve on the training
task, however, she showed improvement on one measure of spoken sentence
comprehension. Compared to controls, two individuals improved at least in one
condition of the WM outcome measures. Thus, our results suggest that a combined
WM and EF training can be beneficial for IWA.",10.1080/09602011.2016.1159579 
"The neuroscience of persuasion: A review with an emphasis on issues and
opportunities.","Persuasion, a prevalent form of social influence in humans, refers to an active
attempt to change a person's attitudes, beliefs, or behavior. There is a growing 
literature on the neural correlates of persuasion. As is often the case in an
emerging literature, however, there are a number of questions, concerns, and
alternative interpretations that can be raised about the research and
interpretations. We provide a critical review of the research, noting potential
problems and issues that warrant attention to move the field forward. Among the
recommendations are greater integration of neuroimaging approaches with existing 
behavioral theories and methods on the information processes (cognitive and
affective) underlying persuasion, and moving beyond solely correlative approaches
for specifying underlying neural mechanisms. Work in this area has the potential 
to contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior relationships as well as to 
advance our understanding of persuasion and social influence more generally.",10.1080/17470919.2016.1273851
