559,"This work presents (131)I (t(½) = 8.04 d) concentrations in sewage effluent from the Stony Brook Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), a small plant serving a regional thyroid cancer treatment facility in Stony Brook, NY, USA. The concentrations detected in sewage effluent ranged from 1.8 ± 0.3 to 227 ± 2 Bq L(-1). The primary source of (131)I is excreta from thyroid cancer inpatients treated at the Stony Brook University Medical Center. Based on several time series measurements following known inpatient treatments, the mean sewage half-life (T(s)) of iodine is 3 d in this plant. The T(s), analogous to a radioactive half-life, describes the time it takes for half of a wastewater component to be removed from a WPCP. Flow recycling, or activated sludge, used to maintain bacterial populations necessary for sewage treatment causes iodine to remain in this plant far longer than its hydraulic retention time. The experimental results suggest that most (131)I entering the Stony Brook WPCP leaves in sewage effluent, not in sewage sludge. Patient treatments can result in continuous discharges of (131)I to surface waters where it can be used as a tracer of sewage-derived material and to understand the behavior of (131)I in aquatic environments.",22925394,2012,Medically-derived 131I in municipal sewage effluent.
560,"Deterioration in the frontal and prefrontal cortex associated with executive functions (EF) occurs with age and may be associated with changes in daily performance. The aim of the present study was to describe changes occurring with age in Executive Functions (EF) and handwriting activity, as well as to analyze relationships between age, EF and handwriting performance. The study population included 80 healthy participants (aged 31 to 76+) living in the community. After answering five questions about their writing habits, the participants completed the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS). In addition, they performed a handwriting task on a digitizer included in the Computerized Penmanship Evaluation Tool (ComPET), which provides kinematic measures of the handwriting process. Significant differences were found between the four age groups for both EF and temporal and spatial handwriting measures. A series of regressions indicated that age predicted 35% of the variance of the BADS profile score (EF control) and 32% of the variance of in-air time while writing. The results of this study indicated age effect on both EF control and handwriting performance. Possible implications for further research and clinical evaluation and intervention are discussed.",24128884,2013,Reprint of 'Age-related changes in executive control and their relationships with activity performance in handwriting'.
561,"CONTEXT
The Chronic Care Model (CCM) has been developed to improve the quality of medical care delivered by general practitioners to patients with multiple chronic conditions. Despite an increasing use of this model, it remains unclear to what extent the different recommendations are valued by the patients.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to identify the preferences of patients with multiple chronic conditions for recommendations of the Chronic Care Model.


METHODS
The patients' preferences were identified with a discrete choice experiment. The hypothetical general practice cares were described using 10 recommendations of the Chronic Care Model (i.e. shared decision making; informational continuity (INF); regular follow-up; planned care; communication; collaboration with a nurse; advices on health habits; patient empowerment; psychological support; coordination). Respondents were consecutively recruited in a hospital setting during routine follow-up visits to their pulmonary specialist. The sample of respondents included 150 patients with multiple chronic conditions in addition to an obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.


RESULTS
The INF is highly valued by the patients. At the opposite, patients do not appear to value collaboration between nurses and GPs. To a large extent, the patients' preferences for the recommendations of the CCM depend on their gender, number of chronic conditions and self-perceived health condition.


DISCUSSION
The INF appeared to be a minimal requirement to ensure high-quality general practice care. The significant interactions between the patients' socio-demographic characteristics and their preferences for the CCM highlighted the necessity to deliver personalized services.",24948135,2015,What are the patients' preferences for the Chronic Care Model?

562,"OBJECTIVE
To synthesise the views of patients on patient-held records (PHR) and to determine from a patient's perspective the effectiveness and any benefits or drawbacks to the PHR.


DESIGN
Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies, which investigate the perspective of patients on the effectiveness of the PHR.


DATA SOURCES
Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMed, Cochrane.


REVIEW METHODS
Systematic review of literature relevant to the research question and thematic synthesis involving line by line coding of the quotations from participants and the interpretations of the findings offered by authors.


RESULTS
Ten papers that reported the experiences of 455 patients were included in the thematic synthesis. Five studies focused on cancer care, two on mental health, one on antenatal care, one on chronic disease and one on learning disability. The completeness of reporting was variable. Three main themes were identified: (i) practical benefits of the PHR (having a record of one's condition, an aide memoire, useful information source and tool for sharing information across the health system); (ii) psychological benefits of the PHR (empowered to ask questions, a place to record thoughts and feelings and feeling in control); and (iii) drawbacks to the PHR (PHR imposes unwanted responsibility and ineffectiveness).


CONCLUSIONS
The effectiveness of the PHR is largely dependent upon uptake across the health system from patients and health-care providers alike. Robust qualitative studies are needed, which offer more complete reporting and examine what patients want and need from a PHR.",25059439,2015,Patients' views on the effectiveness of patient-held records: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
563,"BACKGROUND
Internet discussion forums provide new, albeit less used data sources for exploring personal experiences of illness and treatment strategies.


OBJECTIVE
To gain an understanding of how discussion forum participants value nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in smoking cessation (SC).


SETTING
Finnish national Internet-based discussion forum, STUMPPI, supporting SC and consisting of ten free discussion areas, each with a different focus. The analysis was based on STUMPPI forum participants' postings (n = 24 481) in five discussion areas during January 2007-January 2012.


DESIGN
Inductive content analysis of the postings concerning NRT use or comparing NRT to other SC methods.


RESULTS
Three major themes related to NRT in SC emerged from the discussions. These were as follows: (I) distrust and negative attitude towards NRT; (II) neutral acceptance of NRT as a useful SC method; and (III) trust on the crucial role of NRT and other SC medicines. The negative attitude was related to following perceptions: NRT use maintains tobacco dependence, fear of NRT dependence or experience of not gaining help from NRT use. NRT was perceived to be useful particularly in the initiation of SC attempts and in dealing with physiological dependence. The most highlighted factors of successful quitting were quitters' own psychological empowerment and peer support from the discussion community.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of STUMPPI forum participants had low or balanced expectations towards the role of NRT in SC. More research from the smokers' and quitters' perspective is needed to assess the real value of NRT compared to other methods in SC.",25292017,2015,Is nicotine replacement therapy overvalued in smoking cessation?

564,"OBJECTIVES
The National Institutes of Health, led by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, organized a working group of experts to discuss the problem of weight regain after weight loss. A number of experts in integrative physiology and behavioral psychology were convened with the goal of merging their perspectives regarding the barriers to scientific progress and the development of novel ways to improve long-term outcomes in obesity therapeutics. The specific objectives of this working group were to: (1) identify the challenges that make maintaining a reduced weight so difficult; (2) review strategies that have been used to improve success in previous studies; and (3) recommend novel solutions that could be examined in future studies of long-term weight control.


RESULTS
Specific barriers to successful weight loss maintenance include poor adherence to behavioral regimens and physiological adaptations that promote weight regain. A better understanding of how these behavioral and physiological barriers are related, how they vary between individuals, and how they can be overcome will lead to the development of novel strategies with improved outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
Greater collaboration and cross-talk between physiological and behavioral researchers is needed to advance the science and develop better strategies for weight loss maintenance.",25469998,2015,NIH working group report: Innovative research to improve maintenance of weight loss.
565,"OBJECTIVE
Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain and various associated symptoms, including psychological distress. This study presents a secondary analysis of the interviews of patients with fibromyalgia to appraise the affective load of the patient narratives as assessed by independent clinicians.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
Three clinicians, an internist, a psychiatrist and a psychologist, who were experienced in chronic pain reviewed the interview transcripts of 56 women eliciting their views regarding fibromyalgia onset. A Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was used (0 = no affective load to 5 = maximum affective load) to provide a subjective appraisal of the intensity of the affective impact, as suggested in the transcripts and from the clinician perspectives.


RESULTS
The mean affective load was 3.6 (SD = ±1), indicating the perception of a high affective load in the clinicians. Values indicating a high or very high affective load (≥4 points on the CGI scale) were more frequent than those in the lower range [23 narratives (41%) vs. 3 (5%)]. The inter-rater agreement of the affective load of the narratives was high (K > 0.85). These results of the clinician perspectives parallel those of the patient narratives, emphasizing disruptive circumstances, psychological distress and hopelessness surrounding symptom onset.


CONCLUSION
The affective load in the narratives of these patients with fibromyalgia was high and had a negative undertone when considered from the clinicians' perspective. This study highlights the importance of considering the affective resonance in the context of therapeutic relationships that are often emotionally laden and highly challenging for the clinician.",25494577,2015,Assessing the affective load in the narratives of women suffering from fibromyalgia: the clinicians' appraisal.
566,"Self-criticism is a form of negative self-evaluation that has strong associations with many forms of psychopathology. Rumination is a maladaptive form of repetitive thinking that is associated with many psychological disorders. Although measures of several different types of rumination (e.g., general rumination, depressive rumination, anger rumination) have been developed, none focuses specifically on self-critical rumination. An initial pool of items addressing self-critical rumination was developed by adapting items from existing rumination measures and through a writing task administered to both student and clinical samples. Following an evaluation of content validity, 24 items were administered to a large sample of undergraduates along with measures of related constructs. The final 10-item version of the Self-Critical Rumination Scale showed excellent internal consistency, a clear single-factor structure, convergent relationships with related constructs, and incremental validity over other measures of self-criticism and rumination in predicting both general distress and features of borderline personality disorder.",25712674,2016,Development and Validation of a Measure of Self-Critical Rumination.
567,"Gay and bisexual men (GBM) who participate in gay community subcultures have different profiles, including differing risk behaviors. We examined men's participation in gay community subcultures, and its association with risk behavior. In a cross-sectional survey, 849 GBM provided information about men in their personal networks. We devised measures of their participation in five subcultural groupings and explored their associations with sexual behavior. We identified five subcultural groupings: sexually adventurous; bear tribes; alternative queer; party scene; and sexually conservative. Higher scores on the sexually adventurous measure was associated with being older, having more gay friends, being HIV-positive, and being more sexually active. It was also independently associated with unprotected anal intercourse with casual partners (AOR 1.82; 95 % CI 1.20-2.76; p = 0.005). HIV prevention strategies need to account for the different subcultural groupings in which GBM participate. Measures of engagement with gay subcultures are useful indicators of differential rates of risk behavior and modes of participation in gay community life. Men in more sexually adventurous subcultures are more likely to engage in sexual risk behavior.",25711301,2015,Understanding Gay Community Subcultures: Implications for HIV Prevention.
568,"Cluster-randomized controlled trials were carried out to examine effects on sexual practices of school-based interventions among adolescents in three sites in sub-Saharan Africa. In this publication, effects on communication about sexuality with significant adults (including parents) and such communication as a mediator of other outcomes were examined. Belonging to the intervention group was significantly associated with fewer reported sexual debuts in Dar es Salaam only (OR 0.648). Effects on communication with adults about sexuality issues were stronger for Dar es Salaam than for the other sites. In Dar, increase in communication with adults proved to partially mediate associations between intervention and a number of social cognition outcomes. The hypothesized mediational effect of communication on sexual debut was not confirmed. Promoting intergenerational communication on sexuality issues is associated with several positive outcomes and therefore important. Future research should search for mediating factors influencing behavior beyond those examined in the present study.",25724974,2015,"Adolescents' Communication with Parents, Other Adult Family Members and Teachers on Sexuality: Effects of School-Based Interventions in South Africa and Tanzania."
569,"Once-daily Truvada (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir) as a method of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is one of the most promising biomedical interventions to eliminate new HIV infections; however, uptake among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men has been slow amidst growing concern in popular/social media that PrEP use will result in reduced condom use (i.e., risk compensation). We investigated demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial differences in willingness to use PrEP as well as the perceived impact of PrEP on participants' condom use in a sample of 206 highly sexually active HIV-negative gay and bisexual men. Nearly half (46.1 %) said they would be willing to take PrEP if it were provided at no cost. Although men willing to take PrEP (vs. others) reported similar numbers of recent casual male partners (<6 weeks), they had higher odds of recent receptive condomless anal sex (CAS)-i.e., those already at high risk of contracting HIV were more willing to take PrEP. Neither age, race/ethnicity, nor income were associated with willingness to take PrEP, suggesting equal acceptability among subpopulations that are experiencing disparities in HIV incidence. There was limited evidence to suggest men would risk compensate. Only 10 % of men who had not engaged in recent CAS felt that PrEP would result in them starting to have CAS. Men who had not tested for HIV recently were also significantly more likely than others to indicate willingness to take PrEP. Offering PrEP to men who test infrequently may serve to engage them more in routine HIV/STI testing and create a continued dialogue around sexual health between patient and provider in order to prevent HIV infection.",25735243,2015,Willingness to Take PrEP and Potential for Risk Compensation Among Highly Sexually Active Gay and Bisexual Men.
570,"This study investigated the stability of extreme response style (ERS) and acquiescence response style (ARS) over a period of 8 years. ERS and ARS were measured with item sets drawn randomly from a large pool of items used in an ongoing German panel study. Latent-trait-state-occasion and latent-state models were applied to test the relationship between time-specific (state) response style behaviors and time-invariant trait components of response styles. The results show that across different random item samples, on average between 49% and 59% of the variance in the state response style factors was explained by the trait response style factors. This indicates that the systematic differences respondents show in their preferences for certain response categories are remarkably stable over a period of 8 years. The stability of ERS and ARS implies that it is important to consider response styles in the analysis of self-report data from polytomous rating scales, especially in longitudinal studies aimed at investigating stability in substantive traits. Furthermore, the stability of response styles raises the question in how far they might be considered trait-like latent variables themselves that could be of substantive interest.",25986062,2016,The Stability of Extreme Response Style and Acquiescence Over 8 Years.
571,"Dyslexia is a learning disability characterized by difficulty learning to read and write. The underlying biological and genetic etiology remains poorly understood. One candidate gene, dyslexia susceptibility 1 candidate 1 (DYX1C1), has been shown to be associated with deficits in short-term memory in dyslexic populations. The purpose of the current study was to examine the behavioral phenotype of a mouse model with a homozygous conditional (forebrain) knockout of the rodent homolog Dyx1c1. Twelve Dyx1c1 conditional homozygous knockouts, 7 Dyx1c1 conditional heterozygous knockouts and 6 wild-type controls were behaviorally assessed. Mice with the homozygous Dyx1c1 knockout showed deficits on memory and learning, but not on auditory or motor tasks. These findings affirm existing evidence that DYX1C1 may play an underlying role in the development of neural systems important to learning and memory, and disruption of this function could contribute to the learning deficits seen in individuals with dyslexia.",25989970,2017,Deficits in learning and memory in mice with a mutation of the candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene Dyx1c1.
572,"Extant theory posits well-differentiated dimensions of perceived social support as measured using the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). However, evidence is inconsistent with this multidimensionality perspective, with SPS factor correlations near unity and higher between-factor than within-factor item correlations. This article reports on research investigating the internal structure, gender invariance, and predictive validity of SPS scores. The analyses are conducted in a novel bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) framework, which is designed to account for presumed psychometric multidimensionality in SPS items due to (a) their fallibility as pure indicators of the constructs they are purported to measure and (b) the coexistence of general and specific factors. Based on 376 item responses, evidence was obtained for a bifactor-ESEM representation of the SPS data. In addition, support was found for the invariance of item thresholds and the latent mean invariance of six of the seven SPS factors in the retained solution. Only mean levels of Social Integration were found to differ by gender, with men scoring higher than women. Finally, evidence was obtained for the predictive validity of SPS scores with respect to loneliness and psychological well-being. Quite apart from yielding evidence validating the SPS, this research demonstrates the utility of bifactor ESEM for psychological assessment.",26063712,2016,Construct Validity of the Social Provisions Scale: A Bifactor Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling Approach.
573,"Using 8-year panel data for 1,355 older adults in rural Anhui province, China, this study examined the trajectories and determinants of elder care provided by adult children to their older parents. The results of two-level latent variable growth models showed that trajectories of elder care differed by the gender of children, with an increase in care from sons but a decrease in care from daughters over time. Children's life stages influenced their care provision but differed by gender. Functional impairment of parents and care provided by siblings in the family also affected the care provided by each child. The findings reflect the patrilineal nature of Chinese family systems and demonstrate the linkages between critical life events and caregiving behaviors of adult children. Findings of this study can inform the formulation of elder care policies that meet the needs of families with different structures and at different life stages.",26133805,2016,Trajectories and Determinants of Elder Care in Rural China During an 8-Year Period: Why Having Sons Makes a Difference.
574,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have become the primary health concern for most countries around the world. Currently, more than 36 million people worldwide die from NCDs each year, accounting for 63% of annual global deaths; most are preventable. The global financial burden of NCDs is staggering, with an estimated 2010 global cost of $6.3 trillion (US dollars) that is projected to increase to $13 trillion by 2030. A number of NCDs share one or more common predisposing risk factors, all related to lifestyle to some degree: (1) cigarette smoking, (2) hypertension, (3) hyperglycemia, (4) dyslipidemia, (5) obesity, (6) physical inactivity, and (7) poor nutrition. In large part, prevention, control, or even reversal of the aforementioned modifiable risk factors are realized through leading a healthy lifestyle (HL). The challenge is how to initiate the global change, not toward increasing documentation of the scope of the problem but toward true action-creating, implementing, and sustaining HL initiatives that will result in positive, measurable changes in the previously defined poor health metrics. To achieve this task, a paradigm shift in how we approach NCD prevention and treatment is required. The goal of this American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation/American College of Preventive Medicine policy statement is to define key stakeholders and highlight their connectivity with respect to HL initiatives. This policy encourages integrated action by all stakeholders to create the needed paradigm shift and achieve broad adoption of HL behaviors on a global scale.",26143646,2015,"Healthy Lifestyle Interventions to Combat Noncommunicable Disease—A Novel Nonhierarchical Connectivity Model for Key Stakeholders: A Policy Statement From the American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, and American College of Preventive Medicine."
575,"One aspect of higher order social cognition is empathy, a psychological construct comprising a cognitive (recognizing emotions) and an affective (responding to emotions) component. The complex nature of empathy complicates the accurate measurement of these components. The most widely used measure of empathy is the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). However, the factor structure of the IRI as it is predominantly used in the psychological literature differs from Davis's original four-factor model in that it arbitrarily combines the subscales to form two factors: cognitive and affective empathy. This two-factor model of the IRI, although popular, has yet to be examined for psychometric support. In the current study, we examine, for the first time, the validity of this alternative model. A confirmatory factor analysis showed poor model fit for this two-factor structure. Additional analyses offered support for the original four-factor model, as well as a hierarchical model for the scale. In line with previous findings, females scored higher on the IRI than males. Our findings indicate that the IRI, as it is currently used in the literature, does not accurately measure cognitive and affective empathy and highlight the advantages of using the original four-factor structure of the scale for empathy assessments.",26253573,2016,Assessing Cognitive and Affective Empathy Through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index: An Argument Against a Two-Factor Model.
576,"Given the heightened risk for HIV and other STIs among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) as well as the racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STI risk, an understanding of longitudinal trends in sexual behaviors is warranted as YMSM emerge into adulthood. Drawing from an ongoing prospective cohort study, the present analysis employed latent growth curve modeling to examine trends in distinct types of sexual activity without condoms over time in sample of YMSM and examine differences by race/ethnicity and perceived familial socioeconomic status (SES). Overall, White and Mixed race YMSM reported more instances of oral sex without condoms as compared to other racial/ethnic groups with rates of decline over time noted in Black YMSM. White YMSM also reported more receptive and insertive anal sex acts without a condom than Black YMSM. Declines over time in both types of anal sex acts without condoms among Black men were noted when compared to White men, while increases over time were noted for mixed race YMSM for condomless insertive anal sex. The effects for race/ethnicity were attenuated with the inclusion of perceived familial SES in these models. These findings build on previous cross sectional studies showing less frequent sex without condoms among Black YMSM despite higher rates of HIV incidence in emerging adulthood, as well as the importance of considering economic conditions in such models. Efforts to understand racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STIs among YMSM must move beyond examination of individual-level sexual behaviors and consider both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic conditions in order to evaluate how these factors shape the sexual behaviors of YMSM.",26319222,2015,Longitudinal Trends in Sexual Behaviors Without a Condom Among Sexual Minority Youth: The P18 Cohort Study.

579,"A growing area of interest and relevance in the study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on the relationship between multisensory temporal function and the behavioral, perceptual, and cognitive impairments observed in ASD. Atypical sensory processing is becoming increasingly recognized as a core component of autism, with evidence of atypical processing across a number of sensory modalities. These deviations from typical processing underscore the value of interpreting ASD within a multisensory framework. Furthermore, converging evidence illustrates that these differences in audiovisual processing may be specifically related to temporal processing. This review seeks to bridge the connection between temporal processing and audiovisual perception, and to elaborate on emerging data showing differences in audiovisual temporal function in autism. We also discuss the consequence of such changes, the specific impact on the processing of different classes of audiovisual stimuli (e.g. speech vs. nonspeech, etc.), and the presumptive brain processes and networks underlying audiovisual temporal integration. Finally, possible downstream behavioral implications, and possible remediation strategies are outlined.

580,"The uremic toxin p-cresol (4-methylphenol) is either of environmental origin or can be synthetized from tyrosine by cresol-producing bacteria present in the gut lumen. Elevated p-cresol amounts have been previously found in the urines of Italian and French autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children up until 8 years of age, and may be associated with autism severity or with the intensity of abnormal behaviors. This study aims to investigate the mechanism producing elevated urinary p-cresol in ASD. Urinary p-cresol levels were thus measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography in a sample of 53 Italian ASD children assessed for (a) presence of Clostridium spp. strains in the gut by means of an in vitro fecal stool test and of Clostridium difficile-derived toxin A/B in the feces, (b) intestinal permeability using the lactulose/mannitol (LA/MA) test, (c) frequent use of antibiotics due to recurrent infections during the first 2 years of postnatal life, and (d) stool habits with the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Chronic constipation was the only variable significantly associated with total urinary p-cresol concentration (P < 0.05). No association was found with presence of Clostridium spp. in the gut flora (P = 0.92), augmented intestinal permeability (P = 0.18), or frequent use of antibiotics in early infancy (P = 0.47). No ASD child was found to carry C. difficile in the gut or to release toxin A/B in the feces. In conclusion, urinary p-cresol levels are elevated in young ASD children with increased intestinal transit time and chronic constipation.

581,"Planning impairment is often observed in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but attempts to differentiate planning in ASD from children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TD) have yielded inconsistent results. This study examined differences between these groups by focusing on development and analyzing performance in searching ahead several steps (""search depth"") in addition to commonly used global performance measures in planning. A cross-sectional consecutive sample of 83 male patients (6-13 years), subgrouped as ASD without (ASD-, n = 18) or with comorbid ADHD (ASD+, n = 23), ADHD only (n = 42) and n = 42 TD children (6-13 years) were tested with the Tower-of-London-task. For global performance, ASD+ showed the lowest accuracy in younger children, but similar performance as TD at older ages, suggesting delayed development. Typically, a prolongation of planning time with increasing problem difficulty is observed in older children as compared to younger children. Here, this was most pronounced in ASD-, but under-expressed in ADHD. In contrast to global performance, effects of search depth were independent of age. ASD-, but not ASD+, showed increased susceptibility to raised demands on mentally searching ahead, along with the longest planning times. Thus, examining both global and search depth performance across ages revealed discernible patterns of planning between groups. Notably, the potentially detrimental impact of two diagnosed disorders does not add up in ASD+ in this task. Rather, our results suggest paradoxical enhancement of performance, ostensibly attributable to disruption of behavioral rigidity through increased impulsivity, which did not take place in ASD-.

582,"Joint attention (JA) and spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM) are fundamental processes in social interactions, and they are closely related to empathic abilities. When tested independently, both of these processes have been usually observed to be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is not known how these processes interact with each other in relation to autistic traits. This study addresses this question by testing the impact of JA on SFM of happy faces using a truly interactive paradigm. Sixty-two neurotypical participants engaged in gaze-based social interaction with an anthropomorphic, gaze-contingent virtual agent. The agent either established JA by initiating eye contact or looked away, before looking at an object and expressing happiness or disgust. Eye tracking was used to make the agent's gaze behavior and facial actions contingent to the participants' gaze. SFM of happy expressions was measured by Electromyography (EMG) recording over the Zygomaticus Major muscle. Results showed that JA augments SFM in individuals with low compared with high autistic traits. These findings are in line with reports of reduced impact of JA on action imitation in individuals with ASC. Moreover, they suggest that investigating atypical interactions between empathic processes, instead of testing these processes individually, might be crucial to understanding the nature of social deficits in autism.

583,"This article explores whether understanding of the effects of children's problems on older parents' well-being can be advanced by exploring differences in parent-child relationships within families. Using data from a study in which mothers reported on all adult children, we addressed the question: Do patterns of maternal favoritism moderate the impact of children's problems on psychological well-being? Based on the literature on the effects of children's problems and on parental favoritism, we hypothesized that problems in the lives of favored adult children will have a more detrimental impact than when they affect unfavored offspring. Results revealed strong and detrimental effects of any offspring's problems on mothers' well-being; these effects occurred, however, regardless of parental preference for an adult child. The findings suggest that the well-documented effects of parental preference may be limited in domains such as problems and difficult transitions in adult children's lives.",26482075,2017,Adult Children's Problems and Mothers' Well-Being.
584,"Older adults with arthritis or joint pain were targeted for a pilot program enhancing the Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program with the 10 Keys™ to Healthy Aging Program. Using a one-group, pre-post design, feasibility was examined and improvements in preventive behaviors, arthritis outcomes, and cardiometabolic outcomes were explored. A 10-week program was developed, instructors were recruited and trained, and four sites and 51 participants were recruited. Measures included attendance, adherence, satisfaction, preventive behaviors, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (pain and stiffness), glucose, and cholesterol. Three fourths of participants attended >50% of the sessions. At 6 and 12 months, more than one half performed the exercises 1 to 2 days per week, whereas 28% and 14% exercised 3 to 7 days per week, respectively. Participants (92%) rated the program as excellent/very good. Nonsignificant changes were observed in expected directions. Effect sizes were small for arthritis and cardiometabolic outcomes. This program engaged community partners, demonstrated feasibility, and showed improvements in some preventive behaviors and health risk profiles.

585,"INTRODUCTION
Some studies alerted for the burden of suicidal attempters at emergency rooms. In this study we characterized the suicidal patients admitted to a Portuguese emergency room.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
For three years, all patients assessed by the first author after suicidal behaviour were included. Suicidal intentionality was evaluated with the Pierce Suicide Intent Scale. Clinical records were searched for follow-up status and satisfaction level was assessed through telephone call.


RESULTS
From 120 included patients 70.8% were female, with mean age of 42.35 years. Pierce Suicide Intent Scale suicidal intentionality was low in 30.1%, medium in 59.3%, and high in 10.6% of the sample. The most important predictors of Pierce Suicide Intent Scale intentionality were male gender (p < 0.001), family history of suicide (p < 0.01), divorced or widowed marital status (p < 0.013), and severe mental illness (p < 0.015). In 41.6% of the patients the follow-up status was unknown. Regarding satisfaction, only 19.5% gave a valid answer: 2.7% 'mildly satisfied', 4.4% 'moderately satisfied', and 12.5% 'very satisfied'.


DISCUSSION
The Pierce Suicide Intent Scale is useful on suicidal behavior assessment at emergency rooms. Highly intentional suicidal behaviour is related to male sex, social problems and personal and familial psychiatric history.


CONCLUSION
The quality of administrative records on this psychiatric emergency room setting are still unacceptable. The most important variables correlated with higher suicidal intentionality are the same described in other countries. Of the reachable patients, one fifth was satisfied with provided follow-up. We still need studies for better understanding of suicidal behaviour observed on this Portuguese emergency room.",26574982,2015,Assessment of Suicidal Behavior in a Psychiatric Emergency Room in Lisbon.
586,"INTRODUCTION
Palliative care is closely linked to the concept of quality of life. In this work we will focus our interest on the need to assess quality of life in oncologic paediatric palliative care.


OBJECTIVE
To describe/compare instruments for measuring quality of life in Oncologic paediatric palliative care.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
A literature review of the sever a instruments for measuring quality of life of children under palliative care, in English and Portuguese, between 2000 and 2013, was carried out in the recognized databases for this purpose.


RESULTS
We found fifteen measuring instruments: 10 of them were generic and 5 specific. For each instrument the country of origin, the target age group, fill manner, number of evaluated dimensions, description of dimensions, and number of questions, psychometric properties and validation for the Portuguese language were identified.


DISCUSSION
There has been a growing concern in measuring quality of life in pediatric age. Most measuring instruments were designed, in the United States, after 1994, coinciding with the World Health Organization definition of quality of life. As regards to age, most of the instruments were developed for children aged eight or more years old and there is no one to be answered only by the child. We can see that the majority of measuring instruments, namely the most current, seeking to involve the child in evaluating his/her own health related quality of life through auto-population (n = 10). However, there is still a substantial dependence on parents for the measurement of health related quality of life of their children, despite studies demonstrates differences between the child and parents, on perception of health related quality of life. But, since many children are not able to provide data on health related quality of life either due to their age or because they are ill or with functional incapacity, the only possibility to get information about the health related quality of life of these children is to appeal to parents, who are asked to reflect on the lack of their child, or teenager. Thus full completion by parents of some measuring instruments may be justified. In Pediatrics measuring instruments of health related quality of life are multidimensional, often intended to measure the subjective point of view in relation to the impact of the disease and the treatment have on the physical, psychological and social well-being. Thus, the wide range of dimensions, the differences in number of dimensions and the number of questions between the various instruments tend to reflect the different stages of psychomotor development of the target population.


CONCLUSION
The most commonly measure dimensions were physical ability, emotional/psychological impact, social and at school impact, followed by pain and discomfort and activity level. The majority of instruments are designed for children aged over 8 years. A large number of the questionnaires are self-completion questionnaires. Others can be completed by parents. Most of the instruments tested their internal coherence (n = 9) and, in a small number, the test-retest reproducibility (n = 7) and agreement among observers(n = 2). Most of the questionnaires reported their content validity (n = 10) and construct validity (n = 9), few have examined the validity of criterion (n = 2). Considering the examined instruments, six questionnaires are validated for the Portuguese population (five generic and one specific for oncologic disease).",26574987,2015,[Measuring Instruments of the Quality of Life Pediatric Palliative Care].
587,"Both electrical microstimulation (EMS) and direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the brain are used to perform functional brain mapping. EMS is applied to animal fundamental neuroscience experiments, whereas DES is performed in the operating theatre on neurosurgery patients. The objective of the present review was to shed new light on electrical stimulation techniques in brain mapping by comparing EMS and DES. There is much controversy as to whether the use of DES during wide-awake surgery is the 'gold standard' for studying the brain function. As part of this debate, it is sometimes wrongly assumed that EMS and DES induce similar effects in the nervous tissues and have comparable behavioural consequences. In fact, the respective stimulation parameters in EMS and DES are clearly different. More surprisingly, there is no solid biophysical rationale for setting the stimulation parameters in EMS and DES; this may be due to historical, methodological and technical constraints that have limited the experimental protocols and prompted the use of empirical methods. In contrast, the gap between EMS and DES highlights the potential for new experimental paradigms in electrical stimulation for functional brain mapping. In view of this gap and recent technical developments in stimulator design, it may now be time to move towards alternative, innovative protocols based on the functional stimulation of peripheral nerves (for which a more solid theoretical grounding exists).",26646021,2016,The difference between electrical microstimulation and direct electrical stimulation - towards new opportunities for innovative functional brain mapping?
588,"The amygdala is a complex structure with distinct subregions and dissociable functional networks. The laterobasal subregion of the amygdala is hypothesized to mediate the presentation and severity of autism symptoms, although very little data are available regarding amygdala dysfunction at the subregional level. In this study, we investigated the relationship between abnormal amygdalar intrinsic connectivity, autism symptom severity, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We collected resting state fMRI data on 31 high functioning adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder and 38 typically developing (TD) controls aged 14-45. Twenty-five participants with ASD and 28 TD participants were included in the final analyses. ASD participants were administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Adult participants were administered the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Functional connectivity analyses were conducted from three amygdalar subregions: centromedial (CM), laterobasal (LB) and superficial (SF). In addition, correlations with the behavioral measures were tested in the adult participants. In general, the ASD group showed significantly decreased connectivity from the LB subregion and increased connectivity from the CM and SF subregions compared to the TD group. We found evidence that social symptoms are primarily associated with under-connectivity from the LB subregion whereas over-connectivity and under-connectivity from the CM, SF and LB subregions are related to co-morbid depression and anxiety in ASD, in brain regions that were distinct from those associated with social dysfunction, and in different patterns than were observed in mildly symptomatic TD participants.

589,"OBJECTIVES
Living donor kidney transplantation offers advantages to the patient, however involves risks to the donor. To optimize donors' mental health after donation, we studied the influence of psychological factors on this outcome. Potential predictors were based on models of Lazarus () and Ursin and Eriksen () that describe predictors of mental health mediated by stress.


DESIGN
Prospective design.


METHODS
Living kidney donors (n = 151) were interviewed before donation and completed questionnaires 2.5 months before and 3 and 12 months post-donation. Using multilevel regression models, we examined whether appraisals, expectations, knowledge, social support, coping, life events, and sociodemographic characteristics predicted psychological symptoms and well-being and whether these relationships were mediated by stress.


RESULTS
A greater increase in psychological symptoms over time was found among donors without a partner. Younger age, lack of social support, expectations of interpersonal benefit, lower appraisals of manageability, and an avoidant coping style were related to more psychological symptoms at all time points. The latter three were mediated by stress. No religious affiliation, unemployment, history of psychological problems, less social support, expectations of negative health consequences, and less positive appraisals were related to lower well-being at all time points.


CONCLUSIONS
This study identified indicators of a lower mental health status among living kidney donors. Professionals should examine this profile before donation and the need for extra psychological support in relation to the number and magnitude of the identified indicators. Interventions should be focused on the changeable factors (e.g., expectations), decreasing stress/psychological symptoms, and/or increasing well-being. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Until now, research on psychological outcomes after living kidney donation revealed that mental health remained the same for the majority of living kidney donors, while mental health improved or deteriorated for a minority after donation. In reaction to these findings, many psychosocial screening guidelines have been developed for potential donors; however, the components of these guidelines are based on professional opinions and experience rather than on longitudinal empirical data. There is a lack of research that identifies pre-donation donor characteristics that are related to a lower mental health among donors. Such studies are essential in order to tailor psychosocial support during the donation process. What does this study add? Components that are mostly included in psychosocial screening guidelines for potential living kidney donors are not predictive of deterioration, nor increase, in mental health after donation, except for the lack of a partner. Therefore, there is little evidence on the necessity of rejecting potential donors based on these psychological criteria. The following psychological risk factors are predictive of the absolute level of donors' mental health during the donation process: A history of psychological problems, expectations of interpersonal benefit and negative health outcomes, an avoidant coping style, lack of social support, appraisals of the donation process as an unmanageable and/or negative event, a younger age, no religious affiliation, and unemployment. We argue that potential donors should not be rejected for donation based on these factors, but the indicators should be used to identify donors who might be in need for more psychological support.",26791347,2016,Predicting mental health after living kidney donation: The importance of psychological factors.

To overcome these limitations and more accurately model solid tumors, we developed a highly versatile 3D PEG-fibrin hydrogel model of human lung adenocarcinoma. Our model relevantly recapitulates the effect of oncolytic adenovirus; tumor responses in this setting nearly reproduce those observed in vivo. We have also validated the use of this model for complex, long-term, 3D cultures of cancer cells and their stroma (fibroblasts and endothelial cells). Both tumor proliferation and invasiveness were enhanced in the presence of stromal components.

591,"OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy of a manualized, cognitively oriented psychological intervention, called Mental Fitness, in improving the mental and physical health of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Mental Fitness is a small-group four-session treatment aimed at increasing awareness of one's own bodily perceptions, emotions, and thoughts and is overall tailored on participants' perception of control over their health.


DESIGN
Prospective randomized controlled single-blind trial.


METHODS
Patients with ACS were recruited within a week from their acute cardiac event. Patients in the intervention group underwent one of two variants of Mental Fitness, depending on their perceived (internal or external) control over their health. Patients in the control group underwent standard treatment. All the patients were submitted to a clinical and psychological follow-up for 8 months.


RESULTS
The patients who underwent the Mental Fitness intervention (N = 31) showed, compared to the control patients (N = 34), increased quality of life in its physical, psychological, social and environmental domains, more functional emotional and problem-centred coping strategies, and higher emotional awareness. They also showed improved high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, heart rate, and left ventricular ejection fraction compared to the controls. In addition, they were more successful in maintaining physical exercise.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the efficacy of Mental Fitness in modifying specific psychological and physical variables conditioning cardiological patients' prognosis. It also confirms the importance of differentiating psychological interventions based on the psychological characteristics of the patients. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Traditional symptom-based interventions in heart disease are aimed at diagnosing and reducing psychological symptomatology (e.g., depression), but recent work has shown the usefulness of orienting psychological interventions to patients' representations of themselves and of the world and to how such representations influence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours (e.g., Chiavarino et al., ). What does this study add? Mental Fitness, by working on awareness of bodily perceptions, emotions, and thoughts, leads to positive changes in physical and psychological health. Mental Fitness is a cost-effective psychological intervention that adds significantly to the effectiveness of standard medical care.",26932132,2016,Mental Fitness for patients with acute coronary syndrome: A randomized clinical trial.
592,"The goal of this study was to examine the perceived usefulness, the perceived ease of use and the perceived behavioral control of a Hospital Information System (HIS) for the care staff. We administrated a questionnaire composed of open-end and closed questions, based on the main concepts of Technology Acceptance Model. As results, the perceived usefulness, ease of use and behavioral control (self-efficacy and organizational support) are correlated with medical occupations. As an example, we found that a half of the medical secretaries consider the HIS is ease of use, at the opposite to the anesthesiologists, surgeons and physicians. Medical secretaries reported also the highest rate of PBC and a high rate of PU. Pharmacists reported the highest rate of PU but a low rate of PBC, which is similar to the rate of the surgeons and physicians. Content analysis of open questions highlights factors influencing these constructs: ergonomics, errors in the documenting process, insufficient compatibility with the medical department or the occupational group. Consequently, we suggest that the gap between the perceptions of the different occupational groups may be explained by the use of different modules and by interdependency of the care stare staff.",26958237,2015,Understanding the acceptance factors of an Hospital Information System: evidence from a French University Hospital.

Accurate understanding of patients' attitudes towards both technology and involvement in managing chronic conditions will be critical for informing effective self-management strategies.

To inform the design and tailoring of self-management interventions, we elicited attitudes toward technology use and participation in care of 40 participants in a maximum variation sample. The analysis revealed three participant clusters-""Proactive Techies,"" ""Indie Self-Managers,"" and ""Remind Me!

This study evolved out of an attempt to alleviate stress by defining the best practice or most optimal way to document office visits, allowing providers to see just one more patient each day. We leveraged a change management model that encourages looking for what is working vs. throwing resources at problem areas.

The main findings were: 1) There were strong similarities across the groups in the information types the physicians looked at most frequently, 2) While there was no overall difference in case duration between the groups, we observed two distinct workflow types between the groups with respect to gathering information in the EHR and creating a note, and 3) A majority of the case time was devoted to note composition in both groups.

Currently, the interventions for promoting healthy eating are either too onerous to keep consumers engaged or too restrictive to keep consumers connected with healthcare professionals. In addition, while social media allows individuals to receive information from many sources, it is unclear how peer support interacts with professional support in the context of such interventions. This study proposes and evaluates three mobile-enabled interventions to address these challenges. We examine their effects on user engagement and food choices via a 4-month randomized field experiment. Mixed models provide strong evidence of the positive effect of image-based dietitian support and negative effects of peer support, and moderate evidence of the positive effects of mobile-based visual diary, highlighting the value of mobile apps for delivering advanced interventions to engage users and facilitate behavior change.",26958294,2015,Evaluating Consumer m-Health Services for Promoting Healthy Eating: A Randomized Field Experiment.

Educational disparities research is less common in developing countries. We evaluate whether educational gradients of disability onset exist in Mexico across groups (birth cohort and sex) and whether the association is unexplained or indirect via health (health behaviors, chronic conditions, and self-rated health) or economic (income, wealth, and health insurance) pathways.


METHOD
Data come from the Mexican Health & Aging study. Activities of daily living are reported in 2001, 2003, and 2012 by respondents and spouses aged 50+ (N = 9,560). Groups are analyzed using logistic regression to test education-disability onset associations.


RESULTS
Significant education-ADL onset associations were observed across groups, and much of these associations were direct (unexplained by pathways). Indirect effects operated primarily through the health pathway.

598,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a range of motor symptoms. Besides the cardinal symptoms (tremor, bradykinesia/akinesia, and rigidity), PD patients also show other motor deficits, including gait disturbance, speech deficits, and impaired handwriting. However, along with these key motor symptoms, PD patients also experience cognitive deficits in attention, executive function, working memory, and learning. Recent evidence suggests that these motor and cognitive deficits of PD are not completely dissociable, as aspects of cognitive dysfunction can impact motor performance in PD. In this article, we provide a review of behavioral and neural studies on the associations between motor symptoms and cognitive deficits in PD, specifically akinesia/bradykinesia, tremor, gait, handwriting, precision grip, and speech production. This review paves the way for providing a framework for understanding how treatment of cognitive dysfunction, for example cognitive rehabilitation programs, may in turn influence the motor symptoms of PD.",26982614,2016,Interrelations between cognitive dysfunction and motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: behavioral and neural studies.
599,"OBJECTIVES
'Habit' is a process whereby situational cues generate behaviour automatically, via activation of learned cue-behaviour associations. This article presents a conceptual and empirical rationale for distinguishing between two manifestations of habit in health behaviour, triggering selection and initiation of an action ('habitual instigation'), or automating progression through subactions required to complete action ('habitual execution'). We propose that habitual instigation accounts for habit-action relationships, and is the manifestation captured by the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI), the dominant measure in health psychology.


DESIGN
Conceptual analysis and prospective survey.


METHODS
Student participants (N = 229) completed measures of intentions, the original, non-specific SRHI, an instigation-specific SRHI variant, an execution-specific variant, and, 1 week later, behaviour, in three health domains (flossing, snacking, and breakfast consumption). Effects of habitual instigation and execution on behaviour were modelled using regression analyses, with simple slope analysis to test habit-intention interactions. Relationships between instigation, execution, and non-specific SRHI variants were assessed via correlations and factor analyses.


RESULTS
The instigation-SRHI was uniformly more predictive of behaviour frequency than the execution-SRHI and corresponded more closely with the original SRHI in correlation and factor analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
Further, experimental work is needed to separate the impact of the two habit manifestations more rigorously. Nonetheless, findings qualify calls for habit-based interventions by suggesting that behaviour maintenance may be better served by habitual instigation and that disrupting habitual behaviour may depend on overriding habits of instigation. Greater precision of measurement may help to minimize confusion between habitual instigation and execution. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Habit is often used to understand, explain, and change health behaviour. Making behaviour habitual has been proposed as a means of maintaining behaviour change. Concerns have been raised about the extent to which health behaviour can be habitual. What does this study add? A conceptual and empirical rationale for discerning habitually instigated and habitually executed behaviour. Results show habit-behaviour effects are mostly attributable to habitual instigation, not execution.

600,"Fatigue symptoms are very common among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Fatigue is related to functional and psychological problems and to treatment nonadherence. Using secondary data from ecological momentary assessment, we examined fatigue as a predictor of PLWH everyday experiences. In bidirectional analyses based on the shape shifters model, we also examined these experiences as predictors of fatigue. Data were examined from 67 PLWH who completed daily surveys on a handheld computer. Brief validated scales were used to assess participants' control beliefs, mood, stress, coping, social support, experience of stigma, and motivation. At the beginning and end of the study, fatigue was measured with two CES-D items that have been used in past HIV symptom research. Multilevel models and logistic regression were used to test reciprocal predictive relationships between variables. Moderate to severe fatigue affected 45% of PLWH in the study. Initial fatigue predicted PLWH subsequent overall level of control beliefs, mood, stress, coping, and social support, all p < .05. These state variables remained relatively constant over time, regardless of participants' initial fatigue. In tests for reciprocal relationships with 33 PLWH, average daily stress, OR = 4.74, and stigma, OR = 4.86, also predicted later fatigue. Fatigue predicted several daily survey variables including stress and social support. Stress and support in turn predicted fatigue at a later time, suggesting a self-perpetuating cycle but also a possible avenue for intervention. Future studies should examine daily variation in fatigue among PLWH and its relation to other everyday experiences and behaviors. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27059443,2016,Bidirectional Relationships Between Fatigue and Everyday Experiences in Persons Living With HIV.
601,"Latent class analyses can be used early in the postpartum period to identify mothers of preterm infants experiencing similar patterns of psychological distress symptoms, but whether these classes of mothers also differ in parental responses to their infants or in their infants' development is largely unknown. In this longitudinal multisite-repeated measures study, we evaluated the usefulness of three psychological distress classes (low distress, high depressive and anxiety symptoms, and extreme distress) in predicting mother-infant interactions, quality of home environment, and infant development in 229 mother-preterm infant pairs. Mothers completed psychological distress questionnaires at study entry; parent-infant interaction was recorded at 2 and 6 months of age corrected for prematurity; and infant developmental data were collected 12 months corrected age. Mothers in the extreme distress class engaged in more developmental stimulation at 2 months (β = .99, p < 0.01) and at 6 months (β = 1.38, p < .01) than mothers in the other classes and had better quality of home environment at 2 months (β = 2.52, p = .03). When not controlling for neurological insult, infants of mothers in the extreme distress class had poorer cognitive (β = -10.28, p = .01) and motor (β = -15.12, p < .01) development scores at 12 months corrected age than infants of mothers in the other distress classes, but after controlling for infant neurological insult, there were no differences in cognitive, motor, and language development based on maternal psychological distress class. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27059608,2016,"Relationship of Maternal Psychological Distress Classes to Later Mother-Infant Interaction, Home Environment, and Infant Development in Preterm Infants."
602,"Cancer patients receiving targeted therapies often develop persistent cutaneous adverse effects, such as papulopustular eruption (rash), xerosis cutis (dry skin), pruritus (itch), and hair and nail changes. These can be dose-limiting or a cause for therapy discontinuation but also can be wearing on patients, negatively influencing their self-image and relationships with others. In a Ricoeurian hermeneutic phenomenological study, we aimed to explore the lived experiences of colorectal, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer patients living with cutaneous toxicities following treatment with targeted agents. Narratives were used to elicit the experiences of 22 cancer patients. Data were analyzed in three steps informed by Ricoeur's interpretation theory: naïve understanding, structural analyses, and comprehensive understanding. Three themes were identified: ""Ashamed of what I have become,"" ""Surrender to cancer,"" and ""Mourning for the loss of my body,"" with nine sub-themes revealing the multidimensional impact of the adverse effects on the patients' lives. The comprehensive understanding produced in analysis revealed a new contextualized interpretation of being in the world while living with cutaneous toxicities. Treatment-induced cutaneous toxicities distorted patients' daily living in ways that led to negative manifestations and effects on their self-image, social engagement, and intimate relationships. Although the dose-limiting and treatment-interrupting effects of these toxicities have been reported, this study sheds light on their existential impact, touching on physical, psychological, and social issues. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27080722,2016,"""I Lost My Image, the Image Others Know Me By"": Findings From a Hermeneutic Phenomenological Study of Patients Living With Treatment-Induced Cutaneous Toxicities."
603,"BACKGROUND
Biological therapy targeting tumor necrosis factor-alfa has revolutionized the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Our study retrospectively reviewed clinical outcomes of 60 patients administratively substituted from Infliximab or Adalimumab to Certolizumab. Maintenance of disease and failure rates after substitution of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa agents in CD patients were monitored over 1 year, and this is the first outcomes study of patients maintained on Infliximab or Adalimumab substituted to Certolizumab.


METHODS
A hospital pharmacy directive required all patients on biological therapy to be administratively substituted to Certolizumab therapy. This single-center retrospective analysis initially included 68 CD patients presenting at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport. Clinical, endoscopic, and serologic data were compared at baseline and at 4 intervals over 1 year.


RESULTS
Of 60 enrolled CD patients, 45 (75%) successfully transitioned to Certolizumab and had stable disease at 1 year. Of the 15 (25%) patients who ""failed"" substitution at 1 year, 5 were returned to Adalimumab and 7 to Infliximab; 3 were maintained on steroids awaiting subsequent therapy. Importantly, when patients were segregated on the basis of initial disease control, it was found that 3 (12.5%) previously well-controlled patients failed therapy, whereas 12 (33.3%) who initially had active disease failed Certolizumab substitution.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study found that 25% of CD patients substituted to Cimzia failed substitution, whereas 75% still exhibited a good clinical response with stable disease at 1 year.

Of eleven neuroanatomical areas evaluated for tumor involvement, the basal ganglia was significantly correlated with co-dominant language function (p<0.001). Moreover, among patients whose tumors invaded the basal ganglia, those with language co-dominance performed significantly better on the Boston Naming Test, a clinical measure of aphasia, compared to their left-lateralized counterparts (56.5 versus 36.5, p=0.025). While further studies are needed to elucidate the role of the basal ganglia in establishing co-dominance, our results suggest that reactive co-dominance may afford a behavioral advantage to patients with left-hemispheric tumors.",27108246,2016,Infiltration of the basal ganglia by brain tumors is associated with the development of co-dominant language function on fMRI.

The purpose of this article is to describe the two-step genetic and epigenetic approach that will be executed to explore Gene × Environment interactions on BP using a longitudinal cohort design. Procedure for the single collection of DNA at Time 1 includes the use of the Oragene 500-format saliva sample collection tube, which provides enough DNA for both the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping and 850K EPIC methylation analyses. BP readings, height, weight, percentage of body fat, and percentage of body water will be measured on all participants every 6 months for 2 years for a total of 4 time points. Genomic data analyses to be completed include multivariate modeling, assessment of population admixture and structure, and extended analyses including Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate methods, Monte Carlo approach, EIGENSTRAT methods, and so on, to determine relationships among both main and interaction effects of genetic, epigenetic, and psychological environmental factors on BP.",27118148,2016,The Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) Study: Design and Methods for Complex DNA Analysis.
607,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects motor skills and cognitive performance. The conventional therapeutic approaches for the management of PD are just able to alleviate symptoms. Exploring for achieving novel substances with therapeutic benefits in PD patients is the focus of a wide range of current investigations. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively review phytochemicals with protective or therapeutic activities in PD and focus on their neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms. Various subgroups of polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignanes) and terpenes are the most abundant groups of phytochemicals with well-established antiparkinsonian effects. Other phytochemical categories, such as alkaloids, cinnamates, carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acid amides, also have some representatives with positive effects in PD. Phytochemicals perform their antiparkinsonian effect through several mechanisms of action, including suppressing apoptosis (via the reduction of Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-3, -8, and -9, and α-synuclein accumulation), decreasing dopaminergic neuronal loss and dopamine depletion, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (such as prostaglandin E2, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and nuclear factor-κB), and modulating nuclear and cellular inflammatory signaling, elevation of neurotrophic factors, and improvement of antioxidant status. Plant-derived natural products can be considered as future pharmaceutical drugs or adjuvant treatment with conventional therapeutic approaches to improve their efficacy and alleviate their psychological adverse effects in the management of PD. Well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to evaluate the protective and healing benefits of phytochemicals as promising future drugs in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.",27124673,2016,Phytochemicals as future drugs for Parkinson's disease: a comprehensive review.
608,"David Mechanic has been a pioneering leader in the social and behavioral sciences of health, health services, and health and mental health policy for more than fifty years. One of David's most distinctive qualities has been his vision in identifying trends and defining new research areas and perspectives in health care policy. His early work on how methods of physician payment by capitation and fee-for-service in England and the United States affected physicians' responses to patients and patient care addressed present challenges and many ongoing studies of payment mechanisms. His papers on rationing of health care established a framework for examining alternative allocation mechanisms and just decision making. Influential papers dealt with risk selection, policy challenges in managed care, reducing racial disparities, trust relationships between patients, doctors, and the public and health institutions, and the predicaments of health reform. Focusing on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, David explored its opportunities and challenges especially in providing comprehensive and effective behavioral health services. A hallmark of his work has been his redirecting our attention to the most severely ill and those in greatest need. Less visible is the leadership and institution building endeavors and the many honors David has received.",27127251,2016,Bringing the Social Sciences to Health Policy: An Appreciation of David Mechanic.
609,"Primary care physicians have assumed an increasingly important role in US outpatient mental health care. They are providing an increasing volume of outpatient mental health services, prescribing a growing number and variety of psychotropic medications, and treating patients with a broader array of mental health conditions. These trends, which run counter to a general trend toward specialization and subspecialization within US health care, place new strains on the clinical competencies of primary care physicians. They also underscore the importance of implementing more effective models of collaboration between primary care physicians and mental health specialists. Several elements of the Affordable Care Act provide options for financing and organizing the delivery of integrated general medical and behavioral services. Such integrated services have the potential to improve access and quality of outpatient mental health care for a range of psychiatric disorders. Because people with severe and persisting mental disorders commonly require a higher-level medical expertise than is readily available within primary care as well as a complex array of social services, separate specialized mental health will likely continue to play a vitally important role in caring for this population.",27127264,2016,The Rise of Primary Care Physicians in the Provision of US Mental Health Care.

This article addresses what is needed for social and behavioral interventions to be successful. We draw on important insights for reducing social inequalities in health that David Mechanic articulated more than a decade ago in his article ""Disadvantage, Inequality, and Social Policy."" We begin by outlining the challenge that interventions that have the potential to improve health at the population level can widen social inequalities in health. Next, given that there are racial differences in SES at every level of SES, we review research on race/ethnicity-related aspects of social experience that can contribute to racial inequalities in SES and health. We then explore what is needed for social and behavioral interventions to be successful in addressing disparities and consider the significance of race/ethnicity in designing and developing good policies to address this added dimension of inequality. We conclude that there is a pressing need to develop a scientific research agenda to identify how to build and sustain the political will needed to create policy to eliminate racial/ethnic health disparities.",27127267,2016,Needed Interventions to Reduce Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health.
611,"For children with chronic conditions, well-being is closely related to how well their families function. Most prior research syntheses on family functioning and child well-being have focused on children with a single condition, thereby limiting the potential to aggregate and build on what is known across conditions. To address this challenge, research reports were reviewed and meta-analyses conducted of findings on the relationship between family functioning and child well-being across a range of chronic physical conditions. The sample was derived from a larger systematic review study that included 1,028 reports published between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2014. The current review includes 53 studies in which a relationship between family functioning and child well-being was analyzed using one of four family measures: Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales, Family Environment Scale, Family Relationship Index, or Family Assessment Device. Most studies were cross-sectional and observational (n = 43, 81%). The most frequently studied conditions were diabetes, cancer, sickle cell disease, and asthma. In 37 studies, findings were sufficiently comparable to conduct meta-analyses. Significant correlations were identified between children's psychological health and seven of nine dimensions of family functioning. Significant correlations also were found between dimensions of family functioning and children's problem behaviors, social competence, quality of life, and, to a lesser extent, adherence and physical health. Of the family dimensions, cohesion and conflict were associated most strongly with child outcomes. Understanding the specific family variables, such as conflict, linked to varied child outcomes is key for intervention development. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27128982,2016,Family Functioning and the Well-Being of Children With Chronic Conditions: A Meta-Analysis.
612,"PURPOSE
This study examines two commonly proposed mechanisms, violation and trust, to see if they mediate the relationships between the components of the psychological contract (i.e., promises, fulfillment, and breach) and their impact on the work-related outcomes of job satisfaction, intent to quit, and organizational commitment.


DESIGN
Online surveys were completed by 459 Australian nurses.


FINDINGS
Structural equation modeling revealed that breach and fulfillment have direct and mediated effects on the outcomes, whereas promises had no impact. Violation partially mediated the relationship between breach and job satisfaction and intent to quit, while trust partially mediated the relationships between fulfillment and organizational commitment, and breach and organizational commitment.


CONCLUSIONS
Negative experiences (i.e., breaches) were related to both increased feelings of violation and decreased feelings of trust. In contrast, positive experiences (i.e., fulfillment) increased trust but did not significantly reduce feelings of violation. Nurse and organizational managers can use these findings to improve communication with nurses so as to minimize the negative effects of breach and maximize the positive effects of fulfillment and thus improve attitudes.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Nurse managers need to be careful to make promises regarding their nurses' employment that they can fulfill and to particularly avoid breaking the psychological contract. The potentially disproportionate negative effect of breach means that a breach can undo a lot of efforts to fulfill employment-related promises.",27145168,2016,"Fulfill Promises and Avoid Breaches to Retain Satisfied, Committed Nurses."
613,"BACKGROUND
Patients with chronic pain, depression, and substance use disorder (SUD) are often treated in primary care settings. An estimated 52% of patients have a diagnosis of chronic pain, 5% to 13% have depression, and 19% have SUD. These estimates are likely low when considering the fact that 50% of primary care patients with depression and 65% with SUD are undiagnosed or do not seek help. These three conditions have overlapping neurophysiological processes, which complicate the treatment outcomes of a primary physical illness. Behavioral interventions have been widely utilized as adjunctive treatments, yet little is known about what types of behavioral interventions were effective to treat these comorbidities. This systematic review aimed to identify behavioral interventions targeting chronic pain, depression, and SUD in primary care settings.


METHODS
The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials, using a behavioral intervention, involving adults with at least two of the three conditions.


RESULTS
This search yielded 1,862 relevant records, and six articles met final selection criteria. A total of 696 participants were studied. Behavioral interventions varied in content, format, and duration. Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy adapted for pain (IPT-P), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) showed promising improvements across all studies, albeit with small to moderate effects.


CONCLUSIONS
MORE, ACT, and CBT combined with mindfulness and Motivational Interviewing had the most promising results for treating chronic pain, depression, and SUD in various combinations in primary care settings.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
The evidence is mounting that behavioral interventions such as mindfulness-based or cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective strategies for managing patients with comorbidities of chronic pain, depression, and SUD in primary care. Integrated delivery of behavioral interventions via group sessions, computers, and smart phones may increase patient access to treatment; save time and cost; reduce stigma, patient distress, family burden, and healthcare fragmentation; and provide a ray of hope to amplify conventional treatments.",27149578,2016,"Behavioral Interventions Targeting Chronic Pain, Depression, and Substance Use Disorder in Primary Care."
614,"The purpose of the current study was to evaluate efficacy of techniques adapted from situation awareness research for describing how older adults perceive and understand fall risk factors in the context of daily routine. Eleven older adults watched a video of an older woman performing daily activities. Thirteen intrinsic, extrinsic, and behavioral fall risks were embedded throughout the scenario. The video was periodically frozen/blanked from view while participants answered questions about their understanding of the situation and associated story elements. Participants perceived a variety of fall risk factors but did not necessarily interpret them as indicating fall risk. Many fall risks held non-fall meaning for participants (e.g., newspapers on the floor meant the woman liked to read). Although four participants readily identified a fall risk situation, seven did not until they were explicitly asked to consider safety. Study techniques were effective for describing situation awareness of fall risk and several suggestions for improvement are described.

Individual qEEG indices predicted up to 60% of the variability in SLA, whereas behavioral indices of fluid intelligence, executive functioning, and working-memory capacity were not correlated with learning rate. Specifically, power in beta and low-gamma frequency ranges over right temporoparietal regions were strongly positively correlated with SLA.

616,"Obesity is undoubtedly one of the major public health challenges worldwide because of its rapid progression and deleterious effects of associated diseases. The easier access to tasty and energy-dense foods is thought to greatly contribute to this epidemic. Studies also report that obese subjects and animals (rats and mice) preferentially consume foods rich in fat when they can choose. The origin of this eating behavior remains elusive. Over the last decade, the existence of a taste of fat, besides textural and olfactory cues, was supported by a growing number of studies. The existence of a sixth taste modality devoted to the detection/perception of dietary lipids might offer additive information on the quality of food. While the sense of taste is recognized to be a driving-force guiding food choice, interest in the putative relationships between lipids, gustation and obesity is only now emerging. This mini-review will attempt to summarize our current knowledge on this new field of research.",27165256,2016,Lipids and obesity: Also a matter of taste?
617,"BACKGROUND
The use of psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants, is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in spite of a lack of their robust efficacy in this population. This review provides an overview of the use trends of different classes of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication and their effects on mood, nervous system function, gastrointestinal physiology and immunity drawing from the literature available in the general population, other medical conditions, and when available, patients with IBD. It also covers the evidence base for the actions, efficacy, and potential complications of antidepressants organized by different classes.


METHODS
We conducted a PubMed search of articles relating the different drug classes probed to the terms above in different populations of interest. All types of articles were accepted including case reports and series, open and randomized trials, reviews, and expert opinion. We also examined the reference lists of the publications found.


RESULTS
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the most commonly prescribed agents for anxiety and depression in patients with IBD, though their efficacy for these conditions in the general population are mild to moderate at best. SSRIs are generally well tolerated, though at higher doses, they, like most antidepressant classes, can be associated with activation, serotonergic syndrome, and increased suicidal ideation. TCAs have many more serious side effects but have some shown efficacy for functional GI symptoms. A newer class, the serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can be effective for refractory depression, anxiety and chronic pain syndromes with a side effect profile similar to both SSRIs and more mild manifestations of TCAs. Mirtazapine has moderate efficacy for depression if sedation and weight gain side effects are tolerated and some small support for use in nausea and vomiting. Bupropion targets dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake and has moderate efficacy for depression, and some small support for use in fatigue and smoking cessation. Buspirone has an indication for generalized anxiety disorder though studies show only a minimal benefit. It has some growing evidence for use in functional dyspepsia. Most of these agents have physiological effects on the brain, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract (with the exception of bupropion) hence their therapeutic and side effects manifested in these systems.


CONCLUSION
Antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed for depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain syndromes, but overall support for their efficacy is modest at best. Psychological interventions have growing support for having much more robust effects without the side effects of antidepressants and should be considered first-line treatment or at least an adjunct to psychotropic medications for these conditions.",27167571,2016,Empirically Supported Use of Psychiatric Medications in Adolescents and Adults with IBD.
618,"OBJECTIVES
The role of stress in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has so far been neglected. We investigated the impact of stress exposure (pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events), psychological stress responses (perceived stress, subjective experience of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep), and physiological stress responses (salivary cortisol, plasma copeptin levels) on glucose concentrations during pregnancy.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study, including 203 pregnant women at the maternity department of a Swiss university hospital.


METHODS
All women underwent routine screening for GDM with a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test at 24-30 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events, perceived stress, general psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and amount of sleep were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. Cortisol was measured using fasting and bedtime saliva samples, and copeptin using fasting plasma. All data were collected before communication of the screening test results.


RESULTS
Significant positive associations were found between the number of pregnancy-related major life events and fasting glucose, while there was no association with pregnancy-unrelated major life events. More anxiety and depressive symptoms, a higher general level of distress, and a shorter duration of sleep were related to fasting glucose, although the latter two were no longer significant when age and BMI were controlled for. However, physiological stress responses were not associated with glucose concentrations. When testing for unique associations with fasting glucose, more general distress and shorter duration of sleep independently accounted for higher fasting glucose levels. Finally, when comparing women with and without GDM, we found that women who subsequently received the diagnosis of GDM reported more pregnancy-related life events.


CONCLUSIONS
Some indicators of stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant women, thus representing important risk factors for GDM development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Only approximately half of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) report any known risk factors. Women after GDM diagnosis reported more major life events compared to healthy pregnant controls. What does this study add? Stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant before women were aware of their GDM diagnosis. These represent important risk factors for GDM development and potential targets for intervention.",27169679,2016,Stress exposure and psychological stress responses are related to glucose concentrations during pregnancy.
619,"Do differences between the syntactic categories of nouns and adjectives for describing persons translate into different patterns of brain activation? In this fMRI study, we compared reading person and object descriptions denoted by nouns or adjectives. Previous behavioral studies found that nouns, describing the more abstract construct of social categories, compared to adjectives, describing the more concrete construct of personality traits, have an impact on the inferences made about a person. Additionally, previous neuroimaging findings suggest that abstract constructs recruit a different pattern of brain activation, compared to more concrete constructs. Participants read sentences describing a protagonist by means of a noun or an adjective, as well as sentences describing objects through a noun or an adjective. The results revealed that reading nouns as opposed to adjectives showed increased activation in the left lingual gyrus for persons, and additionally in the right lingual gyrus for objects.

In the social and behavioral sciences, missing data frequently are handled with multiple imputation methods or full information maximum likelihood (FIML) techniques, but healthcare researchers have not embraced these methodologies to the same extent and more often use either traditional imputation techniques or complete case analysis, which can compromise power and introduce unintended bias. This article is a review of options for handling missing data, concluding with a case study demonstrating the utility of multilevel structural equation modeling using full information maximum likelihood (MSEM with FIML) to handle large amounts of missing data. MSEM with FIML is a parsimonious and hypothesis-driven strategy to cope with large amounts of missing data without compromising power or introducing bias.

However, self-management of dysmenorrhea is not well understood in the US, and little evidence is available on factors that influence dysmenorrhea self-management. Guided by the Common Sense Model, we examined women's representations of dysmenorrhea (beliefs about causes, symptoms, consequences, timeline, controllability, coherence, and emotional responses), described their dysmenorrhea self-management behaviors, and investigated the relationship between representations and self-management behaviors. We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 762 adult women who had dysmenorrhea symptoms in the last six months. Participants had varied beliefs about the causes of their dysmenorrhea symptoms, which were perceived as a normal part of life. Dysmenorrhea symptoms were reported as moderately severe, with consequences that moderately affected daily life. Women believed they understood their symptoms moderately well and perceived them as moderately controllable but them to continue through menopause. Most women did not seek professional care but rather used a variety of pharmacologic and complementary health approaches. Care-seeking and use of self-management strategies were associated with common sense beliefs about dysmenorrhea cause, consequences, timeline, and controllability. The findings may inform development and testing of self-management interventions that address dysmenorrhea representations and facilitate evidence-based management. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27177093,2016,Beliefs About Dysmenorrhea and Their Relationship to Self-Management.

Here, we review the ontogeny and biopsychology of sweet taste, highlighting how a biological drive to prefer sweetness at high concentrations during childhood, which would have conferred an advantage in environments of scarcity, now predisposes children to overconsume all that is sweet in a modern food system replete with added sugars. We review the power of sweet taste to blunt expressions of pain and mask bad tastes in foods as well as factors that predispose some to consume high-sugar diets, including experiential learning and taste preferences driven in part by genetics. Understanding children's unique vulnerability to our current food environment, rich in both nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners, is highlighted as a priority for future research to develop evidence-based strategies to help establish healthy dietary behaviors early in life.",27193110,2016,The development of sweet taste: From biology to hedonics.

Analyses controlling for major life events, demographic factors, and school site revealed that victimization indirectly affected delinquency and drug use, but not aggression, through its relationship with sleep problems. Further, the effects of sleep problems on drug use were specific to females.

625,"Suicidal behavior imposes a tremendous cost, with current US estimates reporting approximately 1.3 million suicide attempts and more than 40,000 suicide deaths each year. Several recent research efforts have identified an association between suicidal behavior and the expression level of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) gene. To date, several SAT1 genetic variants have been inconsistently associated with altered gene expression and/or directly with suicidal behavior. To clarify the role SAT1 genetic variation plays in suicidal behavior risk, we present a whole-gene sequencing effort of SAT1 in 476 bipolar disorder subjects with a history of suicide attempt and 473 subjects with bipolar disorder but no suicide attempts. Agilent SureSelect target enrichment was used to sequence all exons, introns, promoter regions, and putative regulatory regions identified from the ENCODE project within 10 kb of SAT1. Individual variant, haplotype, and collapsing variant tests were performed. Our results identified no variant or assessed region of SAT1 that showed a significant association with attempted suicide, nor did any assessment show evidence for replication of previously reported associations. Overall, no evidence for SAT1 sequence variation contributing to the risk for attempted suicide could be identified. It is possible that past associations of SAT1 expression with suicidal behavior arise from variation not captured in this study, or that causal variants in the region are too rare to be detected within our sample. Larger sample sizes and broader sequencing efforts will likely be required to identify the source of SAT1 expression level associations with suicidal behavior. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27229768,2016,Whole-gene sequencing investigation of SAT1 in attempted suicide.

The purpose of this study was to test both instruments in a second low-income population that differed geographically and economically from the original sample. Participants (N = 199) were recruited from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. Paper and pencil surveys were collected at WIC sites by research-trained student nurses. Exploratory principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted, and comparisons were made to the original PCA for the purpose of data reduction. Instruments showed satisfactory Cronbach alpha values for all components. HRP components were reduced from five to four, which explained 70% of variance. The components were labeled sensed risks, unseen risks, severity of risks, and knowledge. In contrast to the original testing, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) items was not a separate component of the HRP. The SEERR analysis demonstrated four components explaining 71% of variance, with similar patterns of items as in the first study, including a component on ETS, but some differences in item location. Although low-income populations constituted both samples, differences in demographics and risk exposures may have played a role in component and item locations. Findings provided justification for changing or reducing items, and for tailoring the instruments to population-level risks and behaviors. Although analytic refinement will continue, both instruments advance the measurement of environmental health risk perception and self-efficacy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27227487,2016,Retest of a Principal Components Analysis of Two Household Environmental Risk Instruments.

Although many nursing studies have focused on moral distress, very few have looked at moral distress and emergency nurses despite the fact that this group works in stressful, fast-paced environments that often involve situations that can lead to moral distress.


OBJECTIVES
The goals of this qualitative study are to determine how emergency nurses define moral distress, describe the experiences of moral distress by emergency nurses and its impact, and identify possible strategies to combat moral distress.


METHOD
This study used a phenomenological qualitative design. A convenience sample was used and included 8 registered nurses from 3 different emergency departments in a midsized urban county in the South Central United States. A structured open-ended interview technique was used.

Furthermore, the common comorbidity with metabolic syndrome points to possible interactions between endocrinological and metabolic alterations in the development of HS. Taking into account the endocrine functions of the human skin, several studies investigated the effects of hormones and the behavior of the pilosebaceous unit in the skin of patients with HS. In this review we describe the current view on the hormonal dysregulation and metabolic syndrome and their role in HS.",27294593,2016,Hidradenitis suppurativa/Acne inversa: an endocrine skin disorder?
631,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this article is to describe how nursing students learned and used motivational interviewing (MI) in a community-based clinical context at a primary care vascular risk reduction clinic focused on health promotion.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A focused ethnography was used to access a sample of 20 undergraduate nursing students, 16 patients, and 2 instructors. Data were generated from participant observations, field notes, student journals, and interviews (one-on-one and focus group).


FINDINGS
Central to the students' experience was their transformation because of learning and using MI. Three sub themes describe the social processes that shaped the student experience: learning a relational skill, engaging patients, and collaborating as partners.


CONCLUSIONS
It is feasible for nursing students to learn MI and use this approach to enhance collaborative care in a primary care setting. The experience can be transformative for students.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Supporting patients to adopt healthy lifestyles is a significant role for nurses in practice. The findings provide key insights and strategies for nurse educators teaching students a collaborative communication approach, such as MI, to engage patients in health behavior change.",27314559,2016,A Focused Ethnography of Baccalaureate Nursing Students Who Are Using Motivational Interviewing.
632,"BACKGROUND
Poor health-promoting behaviors increase the risk of chronic disease and disability in older adults. Nevertheless, the predictors of health-promoting behaviors and their relationship with metabolic syndrome have been poorly characterized in older Taiwanese adults.


OBJECTIVE
To explore the determinants of health-promoting behaviors in community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan and the relationship of health-promoting behaviors with metabolic syndrome.


METHODS
A cross-sectional design was used. A convenience sample of 200 community residents aged 60 years and over was recruited from two large communities in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Data collection included physical examination and a structured questionnaire including measures of health status, health-promoting behaviors, self-efficacy, social support, and metabolic syndrome.


RESULTS
Metabolic syndrome was found in 60% of older Taiwanese adults. These participants had higher scores in interpersonal relationships but lower scores in physical activity. Half of the health-promoting behaviors were explained by behavior-specific cognitions and affect, and 44% of behavior-specific cognitions and affect was explained by the health status of the older adult.


CONCLUSIONS
Physical activity should be promoted in older Taiwanese adults. Positive behavior-specific cognitions and affect and better health status might impact the health-promoting behaviors of these adults.",27340227,2016,The Relationship Between Health-Promoting Behaviors and Metabolic Syndrome in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
633,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this integrative review was to identify, review, synthesize, and analyze the existing literature addressing compassion fatigue (CF) in healthcare providers (HCPs), with careful attention to provider role and practice area. CF needs to be better understood to identify, prevent, and treat it before it becomes problematic for HCPs. CF is representative of the cost of caring and results in physical, emotional, and psychological symptoms that contribute to the decision of the HCP to leave the profession.


METHODS
A literature search, guided by search terms related to CF, was conducted using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PubMed encompassing publications between 2005 and 2015. The selected literature was then systemically reviewed and synthesized for this narrative review.


RESULTS
These preliminary searches resulted in 307 articles, of which 43 met inclusion criteria. These 43 articles were reviewed and reported that CF and related concepts (CF and RCs) were pervasive and affected a wide variety of HCPs working in many clinical settings; however, advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists were not well represented. The literature provided information regarding prevalence, risk factors, prevention measures, and symptoms of CF and RCs.


CONCLUSIONS
While CF and RCs have been explored in a myriad of medical professionals, there is little published regarding APRNs, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. More research is needed to evaluate for the presence of CF in HCPs working in a variety of settings and the degree to which it affects personal and professional well-being, including interactions with patients, patient outcomes, and the quality of professional life. Additionally, as the definition and use of the term compassion fatigue has evolved, a need for a well-developed concept analysis has also become evident.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
A better understanding of current research on CF through narrative review, development of a concept analysis, and further exploration of its impact on HCPs has the potential to improve the overall well-being of HCPs, ultimately leading to better patient care and retention within the profession.",27351469,2016,Understanding Compassion Fatigue in Healthcare Providers: A Review of Current Literature.
634,"Athletes experience a range of mental health problems with at least an equivalent prevalence to the general population. This chapter explores the psychiatrist's role in sport, along a pathway of mental healthcare from 'upstream' prevention, screening, and early detection of mental stress to 'downstream' assessment, treatment, rehabilitation, and recovery from mental illness. At each stage on this pathway the psychiatrist has a broad spectrum of bio-psycho-social strategies to employ in clinical practice. Upstream, the importance of psychological resilience is described along with the concept of mental 'pre-habilitation' (a term usually associated with the prevention of physical injury). Alongside these preventative measures, early detection is improved by education, increased awareness, and by the use of effective mental health screening measures. Further downstream ready access to psychiatric expertise and good collaboration between the psychiatrist and the world of sport improve access to treatment, delivery of that treatment, rehabilitation, and return to sport during recovery.",27347772,2016,Psychiatric disorders: The psychiatrist's contribution to sport.
635,"In developed countries, obesity has become an epidemic resulting in enormous health care costs for society and serious medical complications for individuals. The homeostatic regulation of food intake is critically dependent on top-down control of reward-driven food craving. There is accumulating evidence from animal studies that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is involved in regulating hunger states and eating behavior, but whether OXT also contributes to cognitive control of food craving in humans is still unclear. We conducted a counter-balanced, double-blind, within-subject, pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging experiment involving 31 healthy women who received 24 IU of intranasal OXT or placebo and were scanned twice while they were exposed to pictures of palatable food. The participants were instructed either to imagine the immediate consumption or to cognitively control the urge to eat the food. Our results show a trend that OXT specifically reduced food craving in the cognitive control condition. On the neural level, these findings were paralleled by an increase of activity in the middle and superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate cortex under OXT. Interestingly, the behavioral OXT effect correlated with the OXT-induced changes in the prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Collectively, the present study provides first evidence that OXT plays a key role in the cognitive regulation of food craving in women by strengthening activity in a broad neurocircuitry implicated in top-down control and self-referential processing.

636,"The Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale-Global Rating Method (SCORS-G; Stein, Hilsenroth, Slavin-Mulford, & Pinsker, 2011 ; Westen, 1995b ) reliably measures the quality of object relations in narrative material. It assesses 8 dimensions (on a continuum from maladaptive to adaptive) that mediate interpersonal functioning. The 8 dimensions can be averaged to create a global or composite score to represent a person's overall object relational functioning. This study aimed to create levels of personality organization using the SCORS-G global score ratings of Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) narratives and to explore the construct validity of these levels using a multimethod approach (i.e., psychopathology, normal personality, and life-event data). Meaningful relationships were found between the SCORS-G level of personality organization and aspects of psychopathology (Personality Assessment Inventory; Morey, 1991 ), regulation and control (NEO Five-Factor Inventory; Costa & McCrae, 1989, 1992b ), and number of psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and educational level. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential value of creating levels of personality organization (LPO) using the SCORS-G composite or global ratings as a supplement to the psychological assessment process and further highlights the utility of this measure in the field of personality assessment.

637,"OBJECTIVE
To demonstrate that ephrin-B2 (the ligand of EphB2 receptor) antagonizes the pathogenic effects of patients' N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies on memory and synaptic plasticity.


METHODS
One hundred twenty-two C57BL/6J mice infused with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis or controls, with or without ephrin-B2, were investigated. CSF was infused through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps over 14 days. Memory, behavioral tasks, locomotor activity, presence of human antibodies specifically bound to hippocampal NMDAR, and antibody effects on the density of cell-surface and synaptic NMDAR and EphB2 were examined at different time points using reported techniques. Short- and long-term synaptic plasticity were determined in acute brain sections; the Schaffer collateral pathway was stimulated and the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.


RESULTS
Mice infused with patients' CSF, but not control CSF, developed progressive memory deficit and depressive-like behavior along with deposits of NMDAR antibodies in the hippocampus. These findings were associated with a decrease of the density of cell-surface and synaptic NMDAR and EphB2, and marked impairment of long-term synaptic plasticity without altering short-term plasticity. Administration of ephrin-B2 prevented the pathogenic effects of the antibodies in all the investigated paradigms assessing memory, depressive-like behavior, density of cell-surface and synaptic NMDAR and EphB2, and long-term synaptic plasticity.


INTERPRETATION
Administration of ephrin-B2 prevents the pathogenic effects of anti-NMDAR encephalitis antibodies on memory and behavior, levels of cell-surface NMDAR, and synaptic plasticity. These findings reveal a strategy beyond immunotherapy to antagonize patients' antibody effects.

638,"Several studies have shown sensorimotor deficits in speech processing in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study, 18 individuals with PD and 18 healthy controls were exposed to frequency-altered feedback (FAF) while producing a sustained vowel and listening to the playback of their own voice. Behavioral results revealed that individuals with PD produced significantly larger vocal compensation for pitch feedback errors than healthy controls, and exhibited a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of their vocal responses and the variability of their unaltered vocal pitch. At the cortical level, larger P2 responses were observed for individuals with PD compared with healthy controls during active vocalization due to left-lateralized enhanced activity in the superior and inferior frontal gyrus, premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and superior temporal gyrus. These two groups did not differ, however, when they passively listened to the playback of their own voice. Individuals with PD also exhibited larger P2 responses during active vocalization when compared with passive listening due to enhanced activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, precental gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. This enhancement effect, however, was not observed for healthy controls. These findings provide neural evidence for the abnormal auditory-vocal integration for voice control in individuals with PD, which may be caused by their deficits in the detection and correction of errors in voice auditory feedback.

639,"The nature of the relationship between structure and function is a fundamental question in neuroscience, especially at the macroscopic neuroimaging level. Although mounting studies have revealed that functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity, whether similar structural and functional connectivity patterns can reveal corresponding similarities in the structural and functional topography remains an open problem. In our current study, we used the right inferior parietal lobule (RIPL), which has been demonstrated to have similar anatomical and functional connectivity patterns at the subregional level, to directly test the hypothesis that similar structural and functional connectivity patterns can inform the corresponding topography of this area. In addition, since the association between the RIPL regions and particular functions and networks is still largely unknown, post-hoc functional characterizations and connectivity analyses were performed to identify the main functions and cortical networks in which each subregion participated. Anatomical and functional connectivity-based parcellations of the RIPL have consistently identified five subregions. Our functional characterization using meta-analysis-based behavioral and connectivity analyses revealed that the two anterior subregions (Cl1 and Cl2) primarily participate in interoception and execution, respectively; whereas the posterior subregion (Cl3) in the SMG primarily participates in attention and action inhibition. The two posterior subregions (Cl4, Cl5) in the AG were primarily involved in social cognition and spatial cognition, respectively. These results indicated that similar anatomical and functional connectivity patterns of the RIPL are reflected in corresponding structural and functional topographies. The identified cortical connectivity and functional characterization of each subregion may facilitate RIPL-related clinical research.

640,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) often occur in early-age-of-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and cluster into sub-syndromes (SSy). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 18 F-FDG-PET regional and connectivity-based brain metabolic dysfunctions and neuropsychiatric SSy. NPSs were assessed in 27 EOAD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and further clustered into four SSy (apathetic, hyperactivity, affective, and psychotic SSy). Eighty-five percent of EOAD showed at least one NPS. Voxel-wise correlations between SSy scores and brain glucose metabolism (assessed with 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography) were studied. Interregional correlation analysis was used to explore metabolic connectivity in the salience (aSN) and default mode networks (DMN) in a larger sample of EOAD (N = 51) and Healthy Controls (N = 57). The apathetic, hyperactivity, and affective SSy were highly prevalent (>60%) as compared to the psychotic SSy (33%). The hyperactivity SSy scores were associated with increase of glucose metabolism in frontal and limbic structures, implicated in behavioral control. A comparable positive correlation with part of the same network was found for the affective SSy scores. On the other hand, the apathetic SSy scores were negatively correlated with metabolism in the bilateral orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal cortex known to be involved in motivation and decision-making processes. Consistent with these SSy regional correlations with brain metabolic dysfunction, the connectivity analysis showed increases in the aSN and decreases in the DMN. Behavioral abnormalities in EOAD are associated with specific dysfunctional changes in brain metabolic activity, in particular in the aSN that seems to play a crucial role in NPSs in EOAD.

642,"BACKGROUND
In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended eligibility for dependent coverage under private health insurance. Emerging evidence shows that young adults, including those with behavioral health disorders (BHDs), have benefited from this expansion.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to explore the population characteristics of the remaining uninsured individuals with and without BHDs and to examine whether the factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in the likelihood of being uninsured were different after the implementation of the ACA provision that extended insurance eligibility for young adults in 2010.


DESIGN
We use cross-sectional data analysis.


PARTICIPANTS
We use a nationally representative dataset of the non-institutionalized civilian population in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2007 to 2012.


METHODS
We compare population characteristics of the remaining uninsured individuals ages 19-25, before and after the implementation of the ACA expansion in 2010. We use multivariate logistic regression to estimate the predictors (such as family income and English proficiency) that are associated with the likelihood of having no health insurance. We utilize the Fairlie decomposition method to examine the factors that contribute to racial (non-Latino White (White) vs. non-Latino African-American (African-American)) and ethnic (non-Latino White (White) vs. Latino) differences in the probability of being uninsured. Finally, we apply our analysis among populations with and without BHDs respectively, to examine the differences in the predictors of being uninsured between these two groups.


RESULTS
Among individuals with BHDs, after adjusting for covariates, the estimated probabilities of being uninsured for Whites were 0.21 and 0.16 pre- and post- the ACA expansion, respectively. The predicted probabilities of being uninsured for Latinos were 0.29 and 0.26 and for African-American were 0.19 and 0.17 pre- and post- the ACA expansion, respectively. The ethnic disparity between Whites and Latinos was 19 %. The racial disparity was moderate. Reductions in the uninsured rate of individuals without BHDs were observed as well. However, the ethnicity disparity remained at 19 % and the racial disparity increased by 5 %. Overall, our decomposition model explained 63-89 % of the racial and ethnic disparities in insurance coverage. The major factor associated with the ethnic disparity among those with BHDs was the immigrant status of Latinos, and the major factor associated with racial disparity was geographic location. The major factor associated with the ethnic disparity among those without BHDs included the immigrant status of Latinos, lack of English proficiency, and geographic location, whereas the major factor associated with racial disparity was family income.


DISCUSSION
Our study presents health insurance coverage trends among racial and ethnic minorities after the implementation of insurance expansion, a major provision of the ACA.

643,"Post-task resting state dynamics can be viewed as a task-driven state where behavioral performance is improved through endogenous, non-explicit learning. Tasks that have intrinsic value for individuals are hypothesized to produce post-task resting state dynamics that promote learning. We measured simultaneous fMRI/EEG and DTI in Division-1 collegiate baseball players and compared to a group of controls, examining differences in both functional and structural connectivity. Participants performed a surrogate baseball pitch Go/No-Go task before a resting state scan, and we compared post-task resting state connectivity using a seed-based analysis from the supplementary motor area (SMA), an area whose activity discriminated players and controls in our previous results using this task. Although both groups were equally trained on the task, the experts showed differential activity in their post-task resting state consistent with motor learning. Specifically, we found (1) differences in bilateral SMA-L Insula functional connectivity between experts and controls that may reflect group differences in motor learning, (2) differences in BOLD-alpha oscillation correlations between groups suggests variability in modulatory attention in the post-task state, and (3) group differences between BOLD-beta oscillations that may indicate cognitive processing of motor inhibition. Structural connectivity analysis identified group differences in portions of the functionally derived network, suggesting that functional differences may also partially arise from variability in the underlying white matter pathways. Generally, we find that brain dynamics in the post-task resting state differ as a function of subject expertise and potentially result from differences in both functional and structural connectivity.

644,"We estimate a structural dynamic model of the determinants of obesity. In addition to including many of the well-recognized endogenous factors mentioned in the literature as obesity determinants, we also model the individual's residential location as a choice variable, which is the main contribution of this paper to the literature. This allows us to control for an individual's self-selection into communities that possess the types of amenities in the built environment, which in turn affect their obesity-related behaviors such as physical activity (PA) and fast food consumption. We specify reduced form equations for a set of endogenous demand decisions, together with an obesity structural equation. The whole system of equations is jointly estimated by a semi-parametric full information log-likelihood method that allows for a general pattern of correlation in the errors across equations. Our model predicts a reduction in adult obesity of 7 percentage points as a result of a continued high level PA from adolescence into adulthood; a reduction of 0.7 (3) percentage points in adult obesity as a result of one standard deviation reduction in weekly fast food consumption for women (men); and a reduction of 0.02 (0.05) in adult obesity as a result of one standard deviation change in several neighborhood amenities for women (men). Another key finding is that controlling for residential self-selection has substantive implications.

645,"Sensor-based time series data can be utilized to monitor changes in human behavior as a person makes a significant lifestyle change, such as progress toward a fitness goal. Recently, wearable sensors have increased in popularity as people aspire to be more conscientious of their physical health. Automatically detecting and tracking behavior changes from wearable sensor-collected physical activity data can provide a valuable monitoring and motivating tool. In this paper, we formalize the problem of unsupervised physical activity change detection and address the problem with our Physical Activity Change Detection (PACD) approach. PACD is a framework that detects changes between time periods, determines significance of the detected changes, and analyzes the nature of the changes. We compare the abilities of three change detection algorithms from the literature and one proposed algorithm to capture different types of changes as part of PACD. We illustrate and evaluate PACD on synthetic data and using Fitbit data collected from older adults who participated in a health intervention study. Results indicate PACD detects several changes in both datasets. The proposed change algorithms and analysis methods are useful data mining techniques for unsupervised, window-based change detection with potential to track users' physical activity and motivate progress toward their health goals.",27471222,2016,Unsupervised detection and analysis of changes in everyday physical activity data.
646,"Cognitive control is adaptive in the sense that it inhibits automatic processes to optimize goal-directed behavior, but high levels of control may also have detrimental effects in case they suppress beneficial automatisms. Until now, the system neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomy underlying these adverse effects of cognitive control have remained elusive. This question was examined by analyzing the automatic exploitation of a beneficial implicit predictive feature under conditions of high versus low cognitive control demands, combining event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localization. It was found that cognitive control prohibits the beneficial automatic exploitation of additional implicit information when task demands are high. Bottom-up perceptual and attentional selection processes (P1 and N1 ERPs) are not modulated by this, but the automatic exploitation of beneficial predictive information in case of low cognitive control demands was associated with larger response-locked P3 amplitudes and stronger activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG, BA47). This suggests that the rIFG plays a key role in the detection of relevant task cues, the exploitation of alternative task sets, and the automatic (bottom-up) implementation and reprogramming of action plans. Moreover, N450 amplitudes were larger under high cognitive control demands, which was associated with activity differences in the right medial frontal gyrus (BA9). This most likely reflects a stronger exploitation of explicit task sets which hinders the exploration of the implicit beneficial information in case of high cognitive control demands.

647,"Schizophrenia patients show widespread impairments in brain activity during oddball tasks, which involve responding to infrequent target stimuli while refraining from responding during continuous non-target stimuli. In a network-based investigation comparing schizophrenia or schizoaffective patients to healthy controls, we sought to clarify which networks were specifically associated with target detection using a multivariate analysis technique that identifies task-specific functional brain networks. We acquired data from the publicly available function biomedical informatics research network collaboration, including 58 patients and 50 controls. Two task-based functional brain networks were identified: (1) a response modulation network including bilateral temporal pole, supramarginal gyrus, striatum, and thalamus, on which patients showed decreased activity relative to controls; and (2) an auditory-motor response activation network, on which patients showed a slower return to baseline than controls, but no difference in peak activation. For both groups, baseline to peak activation of the response modulation network correlated negatively with peak to baseline activity in the response activation network, suggesting a role in suppressing the motor response following targets. Patients' impaired activity in the response modulation network, and subsequent longer return to baseline in the response activation network, correspond with their later and less accurate behavioral performance, suggesting that impairment in suppression of the auditory-motor response activation network could underlie oddball task deficits in schizophrenia. In addition, the magnitude of the activity in the response modulation network was correlated with intensity of delusions of reference, supporting the notion that increased referential ideation is associated with hyperactivity within the subcortical striatal-limbic network.

648,"We introduce a novel method for delineating context-dependent functional brain networks whose connectivity dynamics are synchronized with the occurrence of a specific psychophysiological process of interest. In this method of context-related network dynamics analysis (CRNDA), a continuous psychophysiological index serves as a reference for clustering the whole-brain into functional networks. We applied CRNDA to fMRI data recorded during the viewing of a sadness-inducing film clip. The method reliably demarcated networks in which temporal patterns of connectivity related to the time series of reported emotional intensity. Our work successfully replicated the link between network connectivity and emotion rating in an independent sample group for seven of the networks. The demarcated networks have clear common functional denominators. Three of these networks overlap with distinct empathy-related networks, previously identified in distinct sets of studies. The other networks are related to sensorimotor processing, language, attention, and working memory. The results indicate that CRNDA, a data-driven method for network clustering that is sensitive to transient connectivity patterns, can productively and reliably demarcate networks that follow psychologically meaningful processes.

649,"Suicidal behavior has been shown to have a heritable component that is partly driven by psychiatric disorders [Brent and Mann, 2005]. However, there is also an independent factor contributing to the heritability of suicidal behavior. We previously conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar suicide attempters and bipolar non-attempters to assess this independent factor [Willour et al., 2012]. This GWAS implicated glutamatergic neurotransmission in attempted suicide. In the current study, we have conducted a targeted next-generation sequencing study of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, neurexin, and neuroligin gene families in 476 bipolar suicide attempters and 473 bipolar non-attempters. The goal of this study was to gather sequence information from coding and regulatory regions of these glutamatergic genes to identify variants associated with attempted suicide. We identified 186 coding variants and 4,298 regulatory variants predicted to be functional in these genes. No individual variants were overrepresented in cases or controls to a degree that was statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Additionally, none of the gene-level results were statistically significant following correction. While this study provides no direct support for a role of the examined glutamatergic candidate genes, further sequencing in expanded gene sets and datasets will be required to ultimately determine whether genetic variation in glutamatergic signaling influences suicidal behavior. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27480506,2016,A targeted sequencing study of glutamatergic candidate genes in suicide attempters with bipolar disorder.
650,"PURPOSE
Common data elements (CDEs) are increasingly being used by researchers to promote data sharing across studies. The purposes of this article are to (a) describe the theoretical, conceptual, and definition issues in the development of a set of CDEs for research addressing self-management of chronic conditions; (b) propose an initial set of CDEs and their measures to advance the science of self-management; and (c) recommend implications for future research and dissemination.


DESIGN AND METHODS
Between July 2014 and December 2015 the directors of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)-funded P20 and P30 centers of excellence and NINR staff met in a series of telephone calls and a face-to-face NINR-sponsored meeting to select a set of recommended CDEs to be used in self-management research. A list of potential CDEs was developed from examination of common constructs in current self-management frameworks, as well as identification of variables frequently used in studies conducted in the centers of excellence.


FINDINGS
The recommended CDEs include measures of three self-management processes: activation, self-regulation, and self-efficacy for managing chronic conditions, and one measure of a self-management outcome, global health.


CONCLUSIONS
The self-management of chronic conditions, which encompasses a considerable number of processes, behaviors, and outcomes across a broad range of chronic conditions, presents several challenges in the identification of a parsimonious set of CDEs. This initial list of recommended CDEs for use in self-management research is provisional in that it is expected that over time it will be refined.

651,"The emergence of wearables and smartwatches is making sensors a ubiquitous technology to measure daily rhythms in physiological measures, such as movement and heart rate. An integration of sensor data from wearables and self-report questionnaire data about cognition, behaviors, and emotions can provide new insights into the interaction of mental and physiological processes in daily life. Hitherto no method existed that enables an easy-to-use integration of sensor and self-report data. To fill this gap, we present 'Physiqual', a platform for researchers that gathers and integrates data from commercially available sensors and service providers into one unified format for use in Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) or Experience Sampling Methods (ESM), and Quantified Self (QS). Physiqual currently supports sensor data provided by two well-known service providers and therewith a wide range of smartwatches and wearables. To demonstrate the features of Physiqual, we conducted a case study in which we assessed two subjects by means of data from an EMA study combined with sensor data as aggregated and exported by Physiqual. To the best of our knowledge, the Physiqual platform is the first platform that allows researchers to conveniently aggregate and integrate physiological sensor data with EMA studies.",27498066,2016,Let's get Physiqual - An intuitive and generic method to combine sensor technology with ecological momentary assessments.
652,"Neural networks (NNs), in general, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in particular, represent one of the most efficient classifiers among the machine learning (ML) algorithms. Inspired by the stimulus-sampling paradigm, it is plausible to assume that the association of stimuli with the neurons in the output layer of a MLP can increase its performance. The stimulus-sampling process is assumed memoryless (Markovian), in the sense that the choice of a particular stimulus at a certain step, conditioned by the whole prior evolution of the learning process, depends only on the network's answer at the previous step. This paper proposes a novel learning technique, by enhancing the standard backpropagation algorithm performance with the aid of a stimulus-sampling procedure applied to the output neurons. The network uses the observable behavior that varies throughout the training process by stimulating the correct answers through corresponding rewards/penalties assigned to the output neurons. The proposed model has been applied in computer-aided medical diagnosis using five real-life breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, thyroid, and fetal heartbeat databases. The statistical comparison to well-established ML algorithms proved beyond doubt its efficiency and robustness.",27498068,2016,Boosting backpropagation algorithm by stimulus-sampling: Application in computer-aided medical diagnosis.
653,"This paper addresses a different point of view of videogames, specifically serious games for health. This paper contributes to that area with a multidisciplinary perspective focus on neurosciences and computation. The experiment population has been pre-adolescents between the ages of 8 and 12 without any cognitive issues. The experiment consisted in users playing videogames as well as performing traditional psychological assessments; during these tasks the frontal brain activity was evaluated. The main goal was to analyse how the frontal lobe of the brain (executive function) works in terms of prominent cognitive skills during five types of game mechanics widely used in commercial videogames. The analysis was made by collecting brain signals during the two phases of the experiment, where the signals were analysed with an electroencephalogram neuroheadset. The validated hypotheses were whether videogames can develop executive functioning and if it was possible to identify which kind of cognitive skills are developed during each kind of typical videogame mechanic. The results contribute to the design of serious games for health purposes on a conceptual level, particularly in support of the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive-related pathologies.",27507089,2016,Correlation between videogame mechanics and executive functions through EEG analysis.
654,"BACKGROUND
Overcrowding in emergency departments is a global issue, which places pressure on the shrinking workforce and threatens the future of high quality, safe and effective care. Healthcare reforms aimed at tackling this crisis have focused primarily on structural changes, which alone do not deliver anticipated improvements in quality and performance. The purpose of this study was to identify workforce enablers for achieving whole systems urgent and emergency care delivery.


METHODS
A multiple case study design framed around systems thinking was conducted in South East England across one Trust consisting of five hospitals, one community healthcare trust and one ambulance trust. Data sources included 14 clinical settings where upstream or downstream pinch points are likely to occur including discharge planning and rapid response teams; ten regional stakeholder events (n = 102); a qualitative survey (n = 48); and a review of literature and analysis of policy documents including care pathways and protocols.


RESULTS
The key workforce enablers for whole systems urgent and emergency care delivery identified were: clinical systems leadership, a single integrated career and competence framework and skilled facilitation of work based learning.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, participants agreed that whole systems urgent and emergency care allows for the design and implementation of care delivery models that meet complexity of population healthcare needs, reduce duplication and waste and improve healthcare outcomes and patients' experiences. For this to be achieved emphasis needs to be placed on holistic changes in structures, processes and patterns of the urgent and emergency care system. Often overlooked, patterns that drive the thinking and behavior in the workplace directly impact on staff recruitment and retention and the overall effectiveness of the organization. These also need to be attended to for transformational change to be achieved and sustained. Research to refine and validate a single integrated career and competence framework and to develop standards for an integrated approach to workplace facilitation to grow the capacity of facilitators that can use the workplace as a resource for learning is needed.",27507157,2016,Using systems thinking to identify workforce enablers for a whole systems approach to urgent and emergency care delivery: a multiple case study.
655,"Several brain regions are involved in the processing of emotional stimuli, however, the contribution of specific regions to emotion perception is still under debate. To investigate this issue, we combined behavioral testing, structural and resting state imaging in patients diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and age matched controls, with task-based functional imaging in young, healthy volunteers. As expected, bvFTD patients were impaired in emotion detection as well as emotion categorization tasks, testing dynamic emotional body expressions as stimuli. Interestingly, their performance in the two tasks correlated with gray matter volume in two distinct brain regions, the left anterior temporal lobe for emotion detection and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for emotion categorization. Confirming this observation, multivoxel pattern analysis in healthy volunteers demonstrated that both ROIs contained information for emotion detection, but that emotion categorization was only possible from the pattern in the IFG. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis showed reduced connectivity between the two regions in bvFTD patients. Our results illustrate that the mentalizing network and the action observation network perform distinct tasks during emotion processing. In bvFTD, communication between the networks is reduced, indicating one possible cause underlying the behavioral symptoms.

656,"Neuroscience imaging is a burgeoning, highly sophisticated field the growth of which has been fostered by grant-funded, freely distributed software libraries that perform voxel-wise analyses in anatomically standardized three-dimensional space on multi-subject, whole-brain, primary datasets. Despite the ongoing advances made using these non-commercial computational tools, the replicability of individual studies is an acknowledged limitation. Coordinate-based meta-analysis offers a practical solution to this limitation and, consequently, plays an important role in filtering and consolidating the enormous corpus of functional and structural neuroimaging results reported in the peer-reviewed literature. In both primary data and meta-analytic neuroimaging analyses, correction for multiple comparisons is a complex but critical step for ensuring statistical rigor. Reports of errors in multiple-comparison corrections in primary-data analyses have recently appeared. Here, we report two such errors in GingerALE, a widely used, US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded, freely distributed software package for coordinate-based meta-analysis. These errors have given rise to published reports with more liberal statistical inferences than were specified by the authors. The intent of this technical report is threefold. First, we inform authors who used GingerALE of these errors so that they can take appropriate actions including re-analyses and corrective publications. Second, we seek to exemplify and promote an open approach to error management. Third, we discuss the implications of these and similar errors in a scientific environment dependent on third-party software.

657,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is typified as a brain connectivity disorder in which white matter abnormalities are already present early on in life. However, it is unknown if and to which extent these abnormalities are hard-wired in (older) adults with ASD and how this interacts with age-related white matter changes as observed in typical aging. The aim of this first cross-sectional study in mid- and late-aged adults with ASD was to characterize white matter microstructure and its relationship with age. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging with head motion control in 48 adults with ASD and 48 age-matched controls (30-74 years), who also completed a Flanker task. Intra-individual variability of reaction times (IIVRT) measures based on performance on the Flanker interference task were used to assess IIVRT-white matter microstructure associations. We observed primarily higher mean and radial diffusivity in white matter microstructure in ASD, particularly in long-range fibers, which persisted after taking head motion into account. Importantly, group-by-age interactions revealed higher age-related mean and radial diffusivity in ASD, in projection and association fiber tracts. Subtle dissociations were observed in IIVRT-white matter microstructure relations between groups, with the IIVRT-white matter association pattern in ASD resembling observations in cognitive aging. The observed white matter microstructure differences are lending support to the structural underconnectivity hypothesis in ASD. These reductions seem to have behavioral percussions given the atypical relationship with IIVRT. Taken together, the current results may indicate different age-related patterns of white matter microstructure in adults with ASD.

658,"Recent research highlights that patient engagement, conceived as a patient's behavioral, cognitive and emotional commitment to his own care management, is a key issue while implementing new technologies in the healthcare process. Indeed, eHealth interventions may systematically fail when the patient's subjective experience has not been taken into consideration since the first steps of the technology design. In the present contribution, we argue that such an issue is more and more crucial as regarded to the field of Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Specifically, the exact concept of technologies embedded in the patients' surrounding environment implies a strong impact on their everyday life, which can be perceived as a limitation to autonomy and privacy, and therefore refused or even openly opposed by the final users. The present contribution tackles this issue directly, highlighting: (1) a theoretical framework to include patient engagement in the design of AmI technologies; (2) assessment measures for patient engagement while developing and testing the effectiveness of AmI prototypes for healthcare. Finally (3) this contribution provides an overview of the main issues emerging while implementing AmI technologies and suggests specific design solutions to address them.",27515924,2016,The quest for engaging AmI: Patient engagement and experience design tools to promote effective assisted living.

660,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
Sedentary behavior, physical activity and dietary behavior are formed early during childhood and tend to remain relatively stable into later life. No longitudinal studies have assessed the independent influence of these three energy balance-related behaviors during toddlerhood on later adiposity. We aimed to analyze the associations between TV/DVD watching time, outdoor play time and dietary patterns at the age of 2 years and child adiposity at the age of 5 years, in boys and girls separately.


SUBJECTS/METHODS
This study included 883 children from the French EDEN mother-child cohort. TV/DVD watching time, outdoor play time and dietary intakes were reported by parents in questionnaires when the child was aged 2 years. Two dietary patterns, labeled 'Guidelines' and 'Processed, fast foods', were identified in a previous study. The percentage of body fat (%BF) based on bioelectrical impedance analysis and body mass index were measured at the age of 5 years.


RESULTS
In boys, TV/DVD watching time at the age of 2 years was positively associated with %BF at the age of 5 years (β=0.50 (95% confidence interval: 0.001, 1.00) for those boys with ⩾60 min per day of TV/DVD watching time vs those with ⩽15 min per day, P-value for trend 0.05). In girls, outdoor play was inversely associated with %BF (β=-0.96 (95% confidence interval: -1.60, -0.32) for those in the highest tertile of outdoor play time vs those in the lowest tertile, P=0.001). Overall, at the age of 2 years, dietary patterns were associated with both TV/DVD watching time and outdoor play time, but no significant and independent association was observed between dietary patterns and later adiposity.


CONCLUSION
This study shows longitudinal and gender-differentiated relations between both TV/DVD watching time and outdoor play time in toddlerhood and later adiposity, whereas evidence for a relation between dietary patterns and subsequent fat development was less conclusive. Early childhood-by the age of 2 years-should be targeted as a critical time for promoting healthy energy balance-related behaviors.",27528250,2017,Prospective associations between energy balance-related behaviors at 2 years of age and subsequent adiposity: the EDEN mother-child cohort.
661,"The consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs has become a concern in high-performance athletes. Professional athletes are more exposed to drugs than the general population. Although some drugs are unquestionably detrimental to performance, several studies have nevertheless shown evidence of increased consumption of these substances within this sub-population. This review aimed to elucidate alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, and opioid use among high-performance athletes, discussing the prevalence of substance use, its impacts, and alternatives to treatment in this special population. Unfortunately, no clinical trials for the treatment of substance use disorders were carried out with this specific sub-population. Therefore, the strategies adopted for the general population should be adapted to high-performance athletes. Psychological, psychosocial, psychoeducational, cognitive-behavioural, motivational interviewing approaches can be implemented. As regards pharmacological treatment, medications used in the treatment of alcohol and tobacco dependence, such as naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement treatment can be used without problems. However, some medications used in cocaine and opioid dependence treatment, such as moldafinil and methadone, are prohibited by doping enforcement agencies. Professionals involved with athletes should be aware of the signs and symptoms of the acute effects of substances so as to enable an early identification of substance abuse problems, especially during training periods.",27534440,2016,"Discussing prevalence, impacts, and treatment of substance use disorders in athletes."
662,"The human brain is highly dynamic, supporting a remarkable range of cognitive abilities that emerge over the course of development. While flexible and dynamic coordination between neural systems is firmly established for children, our understanding of brain functional organization in early life has been built largely on the implicit assumption that functional connectivity (FC) is static. Understanding the nature of dynamic neural interactions during development is a critical issue for cognitive neuroscience, with implications for neurodevelopmental pathologies that involve anomalies in brain connectivity. In this work, FC dynamics of neurocognitive networks in a sample of 146 youth from varied sociodemographic backgrounds were delineated. Independent component analysis, sliding time window correlation, and k-means clustering were applied to resting-state fMRI data. Results revealed six dynamic FC states that re-occur over time and that complement, but significantly extend, measures of static FC. Moreover, the occurrence and amount of time spent in specific FC states are related to the content of self-generated thought during the scan. Additionally, some connections are more variable over time than are others, including those between inferior parietal lobe and precuneus. These regions contribute to multiple networks and likely play a role in adaptive processes in childhood. Age-related increases in temporal variability of FC among neurocognitive networks were also found. Taken together, these findings lay the groundwork for understanding how variation in the developing chronnectome is related to risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding how brain systems reconfigure with development should provide insight into the ontogeny of complex, flexible cognitive processes.

663,"Experimental research on behavior and cognition frequently rests on stimulus or subject selection where not all characteristics can be fully controlled, even when attempting strict matching. For example, when contrasting patients to controls, variables such as intelligence or socioeconomic status are often correlated with patient status. Similarly, when presenting word stimuli, variables such as word frequency are often correlated with primary variables of interest. One procedure very commonly employed to control for such nuisance effects is conducting inferential tests on confounding stimulus or subject characteristics. For example, if word length is not significantly different for two stimulus sets, they are considered as matched for word length. Such a test has high error rates and is conceptually misguided. It reflects a common misunderstanding of statistical tests: interpreting significance not to refer to inference about a particular population parameter, but about 1. the sample in question, 2. the practical relevance of a sample difference (so that a nonsignificant test is taken to indicate evidence for the absence of relevant differences). We show inferential testing for assessing nuisance effects to be inappropriate both pragmatically and philosophically, present a survey showing its high prevalence, and briefly discuss an alternative in the form of regression including nuisance variables.",27543688,2016,A common misapplication of statistical inference: Nuisance control with null-hypothesis significance tests.
664,"Within the neuroimaging community, coordinate based meta-analyses (CBMAs) are essential for aggregating findings across studies and testing whether those studies report similar anatomical locations. This approach has been predominantly applied to studies that focus on whether activation of a brain region is associated with a given psychological process. In a recent paper, we used CBMA to examine a distinct set of studies-that is, those focusing on whether connectivity between brain regions is modulated by a given psychological process (Smith et al. [2016]: Hum Brain Mapp 37:2904-2917). Specifically, we reviewed 284 studies examining brain connectivity with psychophysiological interactions (PPI). Our meta-analytic results indicated that PPI yields connectivity patterns that are consistent across studies and that can be specific for a given psychological process and seed region. After publication of our findings, we learned that the analysis software we used to conduct our CBMAs (GingerALE v2.3.3) contained an implementation error that led to results that were more liberal than intended. Here, we comment on the impact of this implementation error on the results of our paper, new recommendations for sample sizes in CBMAs, and the importance of communication between software users and developers. We show that our key claims are supported in a reanalysis and that our results are robust to new guidelines on sample sizes.

In this review, using examples and a simple analogy, we discuss the potential for computational models to inform our understanding of brain function and dysfunction. We argue that they may provide, in unprecedented detail, an understanding of the neurobiological and mental basis of brain disorders and that such insights will be key to progress in diagnosis and treatment. However, there are also potential problems attending this approach. We highlight these and identify simple principles that should always govern the use of computational models in clinical neuroscience, noting especially the importance of a clear specification of a model's purpose and of the mapping between mathematical concepts and reality.",27543973,2016,The promises and pitfalls of applying computational models to neurological and psychiatric disorders.
666,"Dysfunction of corticostriatal loops has been proposed to underlie certain cognitive and behavioral problems associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) characterized by repetitive, unwanted thoughts, and behaviors. Although functional abnormalities in the loops involving the orbitofronto-striato-thalamic (OFST) circuitry in patients with OCD have been reported, our understanding of a link between disruptions in the architecture of the intrinsic functional network of the OFST circuit and their symptoms remain incomplete. Using resting-state functional MRI in conjunction with unsupervised clustering and multilevel functional connectivity (FC) techniques, FC of the OFST network and its topological organization in 61 OCD patients versus 61 matched controls were characterized. Patients exhibited disruptions in small-world properties of the OFST circuit, which indicates an imbalance between functional integration and segregation. Patients also showed decreased FC between the central orbitofrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum but increased FC between the medial thalamus and striatal areas. Using one of the largest samples of unmedicated OCD patients to date, our findings provide evidence supporting the OFST dysconnection hypothesis in OCD as a basic pathophysiological mechanism underlying the disorder, showing the disruption of FC between specific cortical, striatal, and thalamic clusters and aberrant topological patterns of the OFST circuit.

667,"Lipid monolayer rheology plays an important role in a variety of interfacial phenomena, the physics of biological membranes, and the dynamic response of acoustic bubbles and drops. We show here measurements of lipid monolayer elasticity and viscosity for very small strains at megahertz frequency. Individual plasmonic microbubbles of 2-6 μm radius were photothermally activated with a short laser pulse, and the subsequent nanometer-scale radial oscillations during ring-down were monitored by optical scatter. This method provided average dynamic response measurements of single microbubbles. Each microbubble was modeled as an underdamped linear oscillator to determine the damping ratio and eigenfrequency, and thus the lipid monolayer viscosity and elasticity. Our nonisothermal measurement technique revealed viscoelastic trends for different lipid shell compositions. We observed a significant increase in surface elasticity with the lipid acyl chain length for 16 to 20 carbons, and this effect was explained by an intermolecular forces model that accounts for the lipid composition, packing, and hydration. The surface viscosity was found to be equivalent for these lipid shells. We also observed an anomalous decrease in elasticity and an increase in viscosity when increasing the acyl chain length from 20 to 22 carbons. These results illustrate the use of a novel nondestructive optical technique to investigate lipid monolayer rheology in new regimes of frequency and strain, possibly elucidating the phase behavior, as well as how the dynamic response of a microbubble can be tuned by the lipid intermolecular forces.",27552442,2016,Single Microbubble Measurements of Lipid Monolayer Viscoelastic Properties for Small-Amplitude Oscillations.
668,"BACKGROUND
Patient motion during myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging (MPI) may be triggered by a patient's physical and/or psychological discomfort. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of state anxiety (patient's reaction to exam-related stress), trait anxiety (patient's personality characteristic) and depression on patient motion during MPI.


METHODS
All patients that underwent MPI in our department in a six-month period were prospectively enrolled. One hundred eighty-three patients (45 females; 138 males) filled in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), along with a short questionnaire regarding their age, height and weight, level of education in years, occupation, and marital status. Cardiovascular and other co-morbidity factors were also evaluated. Through inspection of raw data on cinematic display, the presence or absence of patient motion was registered and classified into mild, moderate and severe, for both phases involved in image acquisition.


RESULTS
The correlation of patient motion in the stress and delay phases of MPI and each of the other variables was investigated and the corresponding Pearson's coefficients of association were calculated. The anxiety-motion (r = 0.43, P < 0.0001) and depression-motion (r = 0.32, P < 0.0001) correlation results were moderately strong and statistically significant for the female but not the male patients. All the other variables did not demonstrate any association with motion in MPI, except a weak correlation between age and motion in females (r = 0.23, P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
The relationship between anxiety-motion and depression-motion identified in female patients represents the first supporting evidence of psychological discomfort as predisposing factor for patient motion during MPI.",27550022,2016,The effect of patient anxiety and depression on motion during myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging.
669,"Domestic violence affects every age group and is present throughout the life span, but, while the mental health impact of domestic violence is clearly established in working age adults, less is known about the nature and impact of domestic violence among older adults. This review, therefore, aimed to synthesize findings on the prevalence, nature, and impact of domestic violence among older adults, and its identification and management. Electronic searches were conducted of Medline, PsycINFO, Cinahl, and Embase to identify studies reporting on the mental health and domestic violence in older adults. Findings suggested that, although prevalence figures are variable, the likely lifetime prevalence for women over the age of 65 is between 20-30%. Physical abuse is suggested to decrease with age, but rates of emotional abuse appear to be stable over the lifespan. Among older adults, domestic violence is strongly associated with physical and mental health problems, and the scarce research comparing the impact of domestic violence across the age cohorts suggests that the physical health of older victims may be more severely affected than younger victims. In contrast, there is evidence that older victims may experience less psychological distress in response to domestic violence than younger victims. Internationally, evidence on the management of domestic violence in older adults is sparse. Findings suggest, however, that identification of domestic violence is poor among older adults, and there are very limited options for onwards referral and support.",27564268,2016,Domestic violence and mental health in older adults.

Systematic searches of 20 electronic databases were performed from inception to June 2016, using a pre-defined search strategy for English language articles containing data on the prevalence and/or odds of adult lifetime or past year domestic abuse among people with dementia. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Among patients with dementia, the past year median prevalence of physical and psychological domestic abuse victimization is 11% and 19%, respectively. Findings from cross-sectional studies show an increased odds of domestic abuse among people with dementia vs those without. Trajectory information indicated that domestic abuse was more prevalent in relationships with a pre-morbid history of abuse.

671,"Data structures have been explored for several domains of computer applications in order to ensure efficiency in the data store and retrieval. However, data structures can present different behavior depending on applications that they are being used. Three-dimensional interactive environments offered by techniques of Virtual Reality require operations of loading and manipulating objects in real time, where realism and response time are two important requirements. Efficient representation of geometrical models plays an important part so that the simulation may become real. In this paper, we present the implementation and the comparison of two topologically efficient data structures - Compact Half-Edge and Mate-Face - for the representation of objects for three-dimensional interactive environments. The structures have been tested at different conditions of processors and RAM memories. The results show that both these structures can be used in an efficient manner. Mate-Face structure has shown itself to be more efficient for the manipulation of neighborhood relationships and the Compact Half-Edge was more efficient for loading of the geometric models. We also evaluated the data structures embedded in applications of biopsy simulation using virtual reality, considering a deformation simulation method applied in virtual human organs.

One of the biggest challenges in this approach, however, is the rate of attrition. OHCs face similar problems as other social media platforms where user migration happens unless tailored content and appropriate socialization is supported. To provide tailored support for each OHC user, we developed personas in OHCs illustrating users' needs and requirements in OHC use. To develop OHC personas, we first interviewed 16 OHC users and administrators to qualitatively understand varying user needs in OHC. Based on their responses, we developed an online survey to systematically investigate OHC personas. We received 184 survey responses from OHC users, which informed their values and their OHC use patterns. We performed open coding analysis with the interview data and cluster analysis with the survey data and consolidated the analyses of the two datasets. Four personas emerged-Caretakers, Opportunists, Scientists, and Adventurers. The results inform users' interaction behavior and attitude patterns with OHCs. We discuss implications for how these personas inform OHCs in delivering personalized informational and emotional support.",27568913,2016,Personas in online health communities.
673,"There is a convergence in the literature toward a critical role for the basal ganglia in action selection. However, which substructures within the basal ganglia fulfill this role is still unclear. Here we used shape analyses of structural magnetic resonance imaging data to determine the extent to which basal ganglia structures predict performance in easy and complex multilimb reaction-time tasks in young and old adults. Results revealed that inward deformation (i.e., local atrophy) of the nucleus accumbens and caudate were predictive of longer action selection times in complex conditions, but not in easy conditions. Additionally, when assessing the relation between behavioral performance and the shape of the left nucleus accumbens in the two age groups separately, we found a significant performance-structure association in old, but not young adults. This result suggests that the relevance of the nucleus accumbens for the process of action selection increases with age.

674,"According to a non-hierarchical view of human cortical face processing, selective responses to faces may emerge in a higher-order area of the hierarchy, in the lateral part of the middle fusiform gyrus (fusiform face area [FFA]) independently from face-selective responses in the lateral inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area [OFA]), a lower order area. Here we provide a stringent test of this hypothesis by gradually revealing segmented face stimuli throughout strict linear descrambling of phase information [Ales et al., 2012]. Using a short sampling rate (500 ms) of fMRI acquisition and single subject statistical analysis, we show a face-selective responses emerging earlier, that is, at a lower level of structural (i.e., phase) information, in the FFA compared with the OFA. In both regions, a face detection response emerging at a lower level of structural information for upright than inverted faces, both in the FFA and OFA, in line with behavioral responses and with previous findings of delayed responses to inverted faces with direct recordings of neural activity were also reported. Overall, these results support the non-hierarchical view of human cortical face processing and open new perspectives for time-resolved analysis at the single subject level of fMRI data obtained during continuously evolving visual stimulation.

However, little is known about the functional development of the hippocampus during childhood due to methodological challenges of acquiring neuroimaging data in young participants. This is a critical gap given evidence that hippocampally-mediated behaviors (e.g., episodic memory) undergo rapid and important changes during childhood. To address this gap, the present investigation collected resting-state fMRI scans in 97, 4- to 10-year-old children. Whole brain seed-based analyses of anterior, posterior, and whole hippocampal connectivity were performed to identify regions demonstrating stable (i.e., age-controlled) connectivity profiles as well as age-related differences in connectivity. Results reveal that the hippocampus is a highly connected structure of the brain and that most of the major components of the adult network are evident during childhood, including both unique and overlapping connectivity between anterior and posterior regions. Despite widespread age-controlled connectivity, the strength of hippocampal connectivity with regions of lateral temporal lobes and the anterior cingulate increased throughout the studied age range. These findings have implications for future investigations of the development of hippocampally-mediated behaviors and methodological applications for the appropriateness of whole versus segmented hippocampal seeds in connectivity analyses.

676,"With the advancement of cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychological research, the field of language neurobiology is at a cross-roads with respect to its framing theories. The central thesis of this article is that the major historical framing model, the Classic ""Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind"" model, and associated terminology, is no longer adequate for contemporary investigations into the neurobiology of language. We argue that the Classic model (1) is based on an outdated brain anatomy; (2) does not adequately represent the distributed connectivity relevant for language, (3) offers a modular and ""language centric"" perspective, and (4) focuses on cortical structures, for the most part leaving out subcortical regions and relevant connections. To make our case, we discuss the issue of anatomical specificity with a focus on the contemporary usage of the terms ""Broca's and Wernicke's area"", including results of a survey that was conducted within the language neurobiology community. We demonstrate that there is no consistent anatomical definition of ""Broca's and Wernicke's Areas"", and propose to replace these terms with more precise anatomical definitions. We illustrate the distributed nature of the language connectome, which extends far beyond the single-pathway notion of arcuate fasciculus connectivity established in Geschwind's version of the Classic Model. By illustrating the definitional confusion surrounding ""Broca's and Wernicke's areas"", and by illustrating the difficulty integrating the emerging literature on perisylvian white matter connectivity into this model, we hope to expose the limits of the model, argue for its obsolescence, and suggest a path forward in defining a replacement.",27584714,2016,"Broca and Wernicke are dead, or moving past the classic model of language neurobiology."
677,"We report high-resolution measurements that experimentally confirm a spiral cascade structure and a scaling relationship of shrimps in the Chua's circuit. Circuits constructed using this component allow for a comprehensive characterization of the circuit behaviors through high resolution parameter spaces. To illustrate the power of our technological development for the creation and the study of chaotic circuits, we constructed a Chua circuit and study its high resolution parameter space. The reliability and stability of the designed component allowed us to obtain data for long periods of time (∼21 weeks), a data set from which an accurate estimation of Lyapunov exponents for the circuit characterization was possible. Moreover, this data, rigorously characterized by the Lyapunov exponents, allows us to reassure experimentally that the shrimps, stable islands embedded in a domain of chaos in the parameter spaces, can be observed in the laboratory. Finally, we confirm that their sizes decay exponentially with the period of the attractor, a result expected to be found in maps of the quadratic family.",27586603,2016,Parameter space of experimental chaotic circuits with high-precision control parameters.
678,"Chimera states occur when identically coupled groups of nonlinear oscillators exhibit radically different dynamics, with one group exhibiting synchronized oscillations and the other desynchronized behavior. This dynamical phenomenon has recently been studied in computational models and demonstrated experimentally in mechanical, optical, and chemical systems. The theoretical basis of these states is currently under active investigation. Chimera behavior is of particular relevance in the context of neural synchronization, given the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep and the recent observation of asymmetric sleep in human patients with sleep apnea. The similarity of neural chimera states to neural ""bump"" states, which have been suggested as a model for working memory and visual orientation tuning in the cortex, adds to their interest as objects of study. Chimera states have been demonstrated in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable cells and in the Hindmarsh-Rose neural model. Here, we demonstrate chimera states and chimera-like behaviors in a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of thermally sensitive neurons both in a system with Abrams-Strogatz (mean field) coupling and in a system with Kuramoto (distance-dependent) coupling. We map the regions of parameter space for which chimera behavior occurs in each of the two coupling schemes.",27586615,2016,Chimera states in a Hodgkin-Huxley model of thermally sensitive neurons.
679,"Two novel and exciting avenues of neuroscientific research involve the study of task-driven dynamic reconfigurations of functional connectivity networks and the study of functional connectivity in real-time. While the former is a well-established field within neuroscience and has received considerable attention in recent years, the latter remains in its infancy. To date, the vast majority of real-time fMRI studies have focused on a single brain region at a time. This is due in part to the many challenges faced when estimating dynamic functional connectivity networks in real-time. In this work, we propose a novel methodology with which to accurately track changes in time-varying functional connectivity networks in real-time. The proposed method is shown to perform competitively when compared to state-of-the-art offline algorithms using both synthetic as well as real-time fMRI data. The proposed method is applied to motor task data from the Human Connectome Project as well as to data obtained from a visuospatial attention task. We demonstrate that the algorithm is able to accurately estimate task-related changes in network structure in real-time.

680,"This study explores the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy in improving facets of object relations (OR) functioning over the course of treatment. The sample consisted of 75 outpatients engaged in short-term dynamic psychotherapy at a university-based psychological services clinic. Facets of OR functioning were assessed at pre- and posttreatment by independent raters using the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale-Global rating method (SCORS-G; Stein, Hilsenroth, Slavin-Mulford, & Pinsker, 2011 ; Westen, 1995 ) from in-session patient relational narratives. The Comparative Psychotherapy Process Scale (CPPS; Hilsenroth, Blagys, Ackerman, Bonge, & Blais, 2005 ) was used to assess therapist activity and psychotherapy techniques early in treatment. Independent clinical ratings of OR functioning and psychotherapy technique were conducted and all were found to be in the good to excellent range of reliability. Specific facets of OR functioning improved with medium to large effect changes posttreatment. These adaptive changes were significantly related to the incidence of psychodynamic-interpersonal (PI) techniques. Also, this study identified the role specific psychodynamic techniques had in facilitating change in a number of underlying dimensions of OR. Patient self-reported reliable change in symptomatology and reliable change in facets of OR were significantly related as well. This study highlights the utility of incorporating psychological assessment into psychotherapy practice to assess change at the explicit (symptoms) and implicit (OR) level. Limitations of this study, future research directions, and implications for clinical practice are discussed.",27606942,2018,Facets of Object Representation: Process and Outcome Over the Course of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy.
681,"INTRODUCTION
Smart watches have the potential to support health in everyday living by: enabling self-monitoring of personal activity; obtaining feedback based on activity measures; allowing for in-situ surveys to identify patterns of behavior; and supporting bi-directional communication with health care providers and family members. However, smart watches are an emerging technology and research with these devices is at a nascent stage.


METHODS
We conducted a systematic review of smart watch studies that engaged people in their use by searching PubMed, Embase, IEEE XPlore and ACM Digital libraries. Participant demographics, device features, watch applications and methods, and technical challenges were abstracted from included studies.


RESULTS
Seventy-three studies were returned in the search. Seventeen studies published were included. Included studies were published from 2014 to 2016, with the exception of one published in 2011. Most studies employed the use of consumer-grade smart watches (14/17, 82%). Patient-related studies focused on activity monitoring, heart rate monitoring, speech therapy adherence, diabetes self-management, and detection of seizures, tremors, scratching, eating, and medication-taking behaviors. Most patient-related studies enrolled participants with few exclusion criteria to validate smart watch function (10/17, 58%). Only studies that focused on Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and diabetes management enrolled persons living with targeted conditions. One study focused on nursing work in the ICU and one focused on CPR training for laypeople.


CONCLUSION
Consumer-grade smart watches have penetrated the health research space rapidly since 2014. Smart watch technical function, acceptability, and effectiveness in supporting health must be validated in larger field studies that enroll actual participants living with the conditions these devices target.",27612974,2016,Health at hand: A systematic review of smart watch uses for health and wellness.
682,"Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, but also by impairments of expressive and receptive linguistic prosody. The facilitating effect of music with a salient beat on patients' gait suggests that it might have a similar effect on vocal behavior, however it is currently unknown whether singing is affected by the disease. In the present study, fifteen Parkinson patients were compared with fifteen healthy controls during the singing of familiar melodies and improvised melodic continuations. While patients' speech could reliably be distinguished from that of healthy controls matched for age and gender, purely on the basis of aural perception, no significant differences in singing were observed, either in pitch, pitch range, pitch variability, and tempo, or in scale tone distribution, interval size or interval variability. The apparent dissociation of speech and singing in Parkinson's disease suggests that music could be used to facilitate expressive linguistic prosody.",27618779,2016,Speech dysprosody but no music 'dysprosody' in Parkinson's disease.
683,"Previous studies have suggested that disorders of consciousness (DOC) after severe brain injury may result from disconnections of the thalamo-cortical system. However, thalamo-cortical connectivity differences between vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state minus (MCS-, i.e., low-level behavior such as visual pursuit), and minimally conscious state plus (MCS+, i.e., high-level behavior such as language processing) remain unclear. Probabilistic tractography in a sample of 25 DOC patients was employed to assess whether structural connectivity in various thalamo-cortical circuits could differentiate between VS, MCS-, and MCS+ patients. First, the thalamus was individually segmented into seven clusters based on patterns of cortical connectivity and tested for univariate differences across groups. Second, reconstructed whole-brain thalamic tracks were used as features in a multivariate searchlight analysis to identify regions along the tracks that were most informative in distinguishing among groups. At the univariate level, it was found that VS patients displayed reduced connectivity in most thalamo-cortical circuits of interest, including frontal, temporal, and sensorimotor connections, as compared with MCS+, but showed more pulvinar-occipital connections when compared with MCS-. Moreover, MCS- exhibited significantly less thalamo-premotor and thalamo-temporal connectivity than MCS+. At the multivariate level, it was found that thalamic tracks reaching frontal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, could discriminate, up to 100% accuracy, across each pairwise group comparison. Together, these findings highlight the role of thalamo-cortical connections in patients' behavioral profile and level of consciousness. Diffusion tensor imaging combined with machine learning algorithms could thus potentially facilitate diagnostic distinctions in DOC and shed light on the neural correlates of consciousness.

684,"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can cause central nervous system dysfunction and widespread structural anomalies as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study focused on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of white matter in a large sample of PAE participants that allowed us to examine correlations with behavioral outcomes. Participants were confirmed PAE (n = 69, mean age = 12.5 ± 3.2 years) or typically developing control children (n = 67, mean age = 12.1 ± 3.2 years) who underwent brain MRI, eye movement tasks, and psychometric tests. A semi-automated tractography method extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values from 15 white matter tracts. The PAE group displayed decreased FA compared with controls in multiple tracts including 3 corpus callosum regions, right corticospinal tract, and 3 left hemisphere tracts connecting to the frontal lobe (cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus). Significant group by sex interactions were found for the genu, left superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the left uncinate, with females in the PAE group exhibiting lower FA compared with control females. Correlations were found between DTI and eye movement measures in the control group, but these same relationships were absent in the PAE group. In contrast, no correlations were found between DTI and any of the psychometric tests used in this study. These findings support the hypothesis that measures of eye movement control may be valuable functional biomarkers of the brain injury induced by PAE as these tasks reveal group differences that appear to be linked to deficits in white matter integrity in the brain.

685,"Cognitive control is the process of employing executive functions, such as attention, planning or working memory, to guide appropriate behaviors in order to achieve a specific goal. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest a superordinate cognitive control network, comprising the dorsal regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and parietal cortex (DPC). How gray matter structure changes across this network throughout neurodevelopment and how these changes impact cognitive control are not yet fully understood. Here we investigate changes in gray matter volume of the key nodes of the cognitive control network using structural MRI scans from 176 participants aged 8-38 years. One hundred and eleven of these also completed a longitudinal follow-up at two years. We compare these with performance on a cognitive battery also measured at these two time points. We found that volume decreases in the cognitive control network were associated with improved performance in executive function (in left DLPFC and bilateral DPC), information processing (in bilateral dACC and right DPC) and emotion identification tasks (left DLPFC). These results were significant after controlling for age. Furthermore, gray matter changes were coordinated across the network. These findings imply age-independent synaptic pruning in the cognitive control network may have a role in improving performance in cognitive domains. This study provides insight into the direct impact of structural changes on behavior within this network during neurodevelopment and provides a normative evidence base to better understand development of cognitive dysfunction in brain disorders.

686,"OBJECTIVE
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are not only often comorbid but also overlapped in behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Little is known about whether these shared phenotypes are based on common or different underlying neuropathologies. Therefore, this study aims to examine the disorder-specific alterations in white matter (WM) structural property.


METHOD
The three comparison groups included 23 male adults with ASD (21.4 ± 3.1 years), 32 male adults with ADHD (23.4 ± 3.3 years), and 29 age-matched healthy male controls (22.4 ± 3.3 years). After acquisition of the diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), whole brain tractography was reconstructed by a tract-based automatic analysis. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values were computed to indicate tract-specific WM property with adjusted P value < 0.05 for false discovery rate correction.


RESULTS
Post hoc analyses revealed that men with ASD exhibited significant lower GFA values than men with ADHD and male controls in six identified fiber tracts: the right arcuate fasciculus, right cingulum (hippocampal part), anterior commissure, and three callosal fibers (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex part, precentral part, superior temporal part). There was no significant difference in the GFA values of any of the fiber tracts between men with ADHD and controls. In men with ASD, the GFA values of the right arcuate fasciculus and right cingulum (hippocampal part) were negatively associated with autistic social-deficit symptoms, and the anterior commissure GFA value was positively correlated with intelligence.

This study highlights the disorder-specific alteration of the microstructural property of WM tracts in male adults with ASD.

687,"Subcortical functions for language capacities are poorly defined, but may be investigated in the context of deep brain stimulation. Here, we studied event-related potentials recorded from electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) together with surface-EEG. Participants completed a lexical decision task (LDT), which required the differentiation of acoustically presented words from pseudo-words by button press. Target stimuli were preceded by prime-words. In recordings from VIM, a slow potential shift apparent at the lower electrode contacts persisted during target stimulus presentation (equally for words and pseudo-words). In contrast, recordings from STN electrodes showed a short local activation on prime-words but not target-stimuli. In both depth-recording regions, further components related to contralateral motor responses to target words were evident. On scalp level, mid-central activations on (pseudo)lexical stimuli were obtained, in line with the expression of N400 potentials. The prolonged activity recorded from VIM, exclusively accompanying the relevant LDT phase, is in line with the idea of thalamic ""selective engagement"" for supporting the realization of the behavioral focus demanded by the task. In contrast, the phasic prime related activity rather indicates ""procedural"" STN functions, for example, for trial sequencing or readiness inhibition of prepared target reactions.

688,"After peripheral nerve damage, injured or stressed primary sensory neurons (PSNs) transmitting pathological pain (pathopain) sensitize central nervous system (CNS) neural circuits and determine behavioral phenotypes of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). Therefore, phenotypic profiling of pathopain-transmitting PSNs is vital for probing and discovering PNP conditions. Following peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs), PNP might be potentially transmitted by distinct classes of damaged or stressed PSNs, such as axotomized PSNs without regeneration (axotomy-non-regenerative neurons), axotomized PSNs with accurate regeneration (axotomy-regenerative neurons), and spared intact PSNs adjacent to axotomized neurons (axotomy-spared neurons). Both axotomy-non-regenerative neurons and axotomy-spared neurons have been definitely shown to participate in specific PNP transmission. However, whether axotomy-regenerative neurons could transmit PNP with unique features has remained unclear. Recent studies in rodent models of axonotmesis have clearly demonstrated that axotomy-regenerative neurons alone transmit persistent pathological pain with unique behavioral phenotypes. In this review, we exclusively review this novel category of PNP, reasonably term it 'regenerative peripheral neuropathic pain', and finally discuss its potential clinical significance as a new therapeutic dimension for PNIs beyond nerve regeneration.",27664772,2017,"Regenerative peripheral neuropathic pain: novel pathological pain, new therapeutic dimension."
689,"Reducing off-label antipsychotic medication use for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in nursing home residents has been a centerpiece of government regulation, but without insight into utilization differences based on resident and facility characteristics. To examine whether resident and facility characteristics can predict off-label antipsychotic medication treatment for BPSD, residents prescribed antipsychotic medication (N = 216) from 17 Maryland nursing facilities were randomly selected. Based on physician diagnoses, 59.7% of participants were taking off-label antipsychotic medications for BPSD. Hierarchical logistic regression results suggest that dementia level (indicated by Brief Cognitive Assessment Tool scores) and age, but not facility characteristics, significantly predict greater likelihood of using off-label antipsychotic medications for BPSD. Having moderate-severe dementia was associated with more than a four-fold increase in off-label antipsychotic medication use for BPSD. Off-label use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD remains high, especially for older nursing home residents with more severe dementia, indicating that more targeted reduction approaches are needed.

690,"Research in auditory neuroscience illustrated the importance of superior temporal sulcus (STS) for speech sound processing. However, evidence for abstract processing beyond the level of phonetics in STS has remained elusive. In this study, we follow an underspecification approach according to which the phonological representation of vowels is based on the presence vs. absence of abstract features. We hypothesized that phonological mismatch in a same/different task is governed by underspecification: A less specified vowel in second position of same/different minimal pairs (e.g. [e]) compared to its more specified counterpart in first position (e.g. [o]) should result in stronger activation in STS than in the reverse presentation. Whole-brain analyses confirmed this hypothesis in a bilateral cluster in STS. However, this effect interacted with the feature-distance between first and second vowel and was most pronounced for a minimal, one-feature distance, evidencing the benefit of phonological information for processing acoustically minimal sound differences.",27669107,2016,Mental representations of vowel features asymmetrically modulate activity in superior temporal sulcus.
691,"Impulsivity is considered a multidimensional construct that encompasses a range of behaviors, including poor impulse control, premature decision-making, and the inability to delay gratification. In order to determine the extent to which impulsivity and its components share a common network, a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis was performed in a large sample of patients (N = 131) with focal, penetrating traumatic brain injuries (pTBI). Impulsivity was assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), a standard self-report measure that allows for unique estimates of global impulsivity and its factor analysis-derived components (e.g., ""motor impulsivity""). Heightened global impulsivity was associated with damage to multiple areas in bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), left superior, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, and left hippocampus. Moreover, a cluster was identified within the left PFC associated specifically with motor impulsivity (defined as ""acting without thinking""). The results were consistent with the existing literature on bilateral prefrontal cortical involvement in behavioral impulsivity, but also provided new evidence for a more complex neuroanatomical representation of this construct, characterized by left-lateralized temporal and hippocampal involvement, as well as a left-lateralized prefrontal network specifically associated with motor impulsivity.

692,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate associations between self-reported and objectively measured physical activity, sedentary behavior and overweight/obesity based on percent body fat measured with Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio and body mass index, focusing on different intensities and domains of physical activity.


METHODS
Data from NHANES 2003-2006 were analyzed using linear and ordered logistic regression analyses. A total of 4794 individuals aged 18-69 years with valid physical activity and DXA data were included. Objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using accelerometers, self-reported physical activity using the NHANES physical activity questionnaire. Weight, height, WC and DXA measures were assessed in the mobile examination centers.


RESULTS
We observed statistically significant associations between objectively measured moderate and vigorous physical activity and all definitions of overweight/obesity. For total physical activity, the odds of being in the higher percent body fat category were 0.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41, 0.77) for the medium and 0.30 (95% CI 0.22, 0.40) for the highest physical activity tertile compared with the lowest. For light activities, lifestyle activities and sedentary behavior, associations were only observed in the linear models with percent total body fat but not in the ordered logistic regression models. Regarding self-reported physical activity, consistent significant associations with overweight/obesity were only observed for vigorous and for transport activity.


CONCLUSIONS
Regarding moderate and vigorous physical activity, more active individuals were less affected by overweight/obesity than less active individuals, emphasizing the public health effect of physical activity in the prevention of overweight/obesity. The fact that associations were more consistent for objectively measured than for self-reported physical activity may be due to bias related to self-reporting. Associations between lower intensity activities and overweight/obesity were weak or inexistent.",27677618,2017,"Associations between self-reported and objectively measured physical activity, sedentary behavior and overweight/obesity in NHANES 2003-2006."
693,"Working memory is responsible for keeping information in mind when it is no longer in view, linking perception with higher cognitive functions. Despite such crucial role, short-term maintenance of visual information is severely limited. Research suggests that capacity limits in visual short-term memory (VSTM) are correlated with sustained activity in distinct brain areas. Here, we investigated whether variability in the structure of the brain is reflected in individual differences of behavioral capacity estimates for spatial and object VSTM. Behavioral capacity estimates were calculated separately for spatial and object information using a novel adaptive staircase procedure and were found to be unrelated, supporting domain-specific VSTM capacity limits. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses revealed dissociable neuroanatomical correlates of spatial versus object VSTM. Interindividual variability in spatial VSTM was reflected in the gray matter density of the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, object VSTM was reflected in the gray matter density of the left insula. These dissociable findings highlight the importance of considering domain-specific estimates of VSTM capacity and point to the crucial brain regions that limit VSTM capacity for different types of visual information.

694,"Experiences of domestic and sexual violence are common in patients attending primary care. Most often they are not identified due to barriers to asking by health practitioners and disclosure by patients. Women are more likely than men to experience such violence and present with mental and physical health symptoms to health practitioners. If identified through screening or case finding as experiencing violence they need to be supported to recover from these traumas. This paper draws on systematic reviews published in 2013-2015 and a further literature search undertaken to identify recent intervention studies relevant to recovery from domestic and sexual violence in primary care. There is limited evidence as to what interventions in primary care assist with recovery from domestic violence; however, they can be categorized into the following areas: first line response and referral, psychological treatments, safety planning and advocacy, including through home visitation and peer support programmes, and parenting and mother-child interventions. Sexual violence interventions usually include trauma informed care and models to support recovery. The most promising results have been from nurse home visiting advocacy programmes, mother-child psychotherapeutic interventions, and specific psychological treatments (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Trauma informed Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and, for sexual assault, Exposure and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Interventions). Holistic healing models have not been formally tested by randomized controlled trials, but show some promise.

695,"Previous studies on visuo-haptic shape processing provide evidence that visually learned shape information can transfer to the haptic domain. In particular, recent neuroimaging studies have shown that visually learned novel objects that were haptically tested recruited parts of the ventral pathway from early visual cortex to the temporal lobe. Interestingly, in such tasks considerable individual variation in cross-modal transfer performance was observed. Here, we investigate whether this individual variation may be reflected in microstructural characteristics of white-matter (WM) pathways. We first trained participants on a fine-grained categorization task of novel shapes in the visual domain, followed by a haptic categorization test. We then correlated visual training-performance and haptic test-performance, as well as performance on a symbol-coding task requiring visuo-motor dexterity with microstructural properties of WM bundles potentially involved in visuo-haptic processing (the inferior longitudinal fasciculus [ILF], the fronto-temporal part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus [SLFft ] and the vertical occipital fasciculus [VOF]). Behavioral results showed that haptic categorization performance was good on average but exhibited large inter-individual variability. Haptic performance also was correlated with performance in the symbol-coding task. WM analyses showed that fast visual learners exhibited higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in left SLFft and left VOF. Importantly, haptic test-performance (and symbol-coding performance) correlated with FA in ILF and with axial diffusivity in SLFft . These findings provide clear evidence that individual variation in visuo-haptic performance can be linked to microstructural characteristics of WM pathways.

696,"Experimentally induced tonic muscle pain evokes divergent muscle vasoconstrictor responses, with some individuals exhibiting a sustained increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and others a sustained decrease. These patterns cannot be predicted from an individual's baseline physiological or psychological measures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the different muscle sympathetic responses to tonic muscle pain were associated with differential changes in regional brain activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain was performed concurrently with microelectrode recording of MSNA from the peroneal nerve during a 40-min infusion of hypertonic saline into the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle. MSNA increased in 26 and decreased in 11 of 37 subjects during tonic muscle pain. Within the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, precuneus, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and dorsomedial hypothalamus, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity increased in the increasing-MSNA group and remained at baseline or decreased in the decreasing-MSNA group. Similar responses occurred in the dorsolateral pons and in the region of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. By contrast, within the region of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) signal intensity initially increased in both groups but returned to baseline levels only in the increasing-MSNA group. These results suggest that the divergent sympathetic responses to muscle pain result from activation of a neural pathway that includes the dlPAG, an area thought to be responsible for the behavioral and cardiovascular responses to psychological rather than physical stressors.

697,"This study investigated interactive exchange in lovers and the associated interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning. Three types of female-male dyads, lovers, friends, and strangers, performed a cooperation task during which brain activity was recorded in right frontoparietal regions. We measured better cooperative behavior in lover dyads compared with friend and stranger dyads. Lover dyads demonstrated increased IBS in right superior frontal cortex, which also covaried with their task performance.

Although there is a large body of literature regarding the harmful effects of chronic stress on different aspects of human life, acute stress is the most common form of stress, resulting from the demands and pressures of the recent past and the anticipated demands and pressures of the near future. In spite of its pervasive nature, less attention has been paid to the impact of acute stress on sensory processing than to the consequences of chronic stress, particularly concerning auditory processing. In this systematic review, the impact of experimental acute stress on the auditory processing of healthy adults was investigated. The results revealed the adverse effects of acute physical and psychological stresses on auditory processing. According to the open field of research on stress and the auditory system and the high possibility of experiencing different types of acute stresses in various life environments, including testing places, it seems that more investigations are needed to identify and manage different types of acute stresses in both clinical and research situations.",27718496,2017,Effect of acute stress on auditory processing: a systematic review of human studies.
700,"The formation of a coherent and unified self-concept represents a key developmental stage during adolescence. Imaging studies on self-referential processing in adolescents are rare, and it is not clear whether neural structures involved in self-reflection are also involved in reflections of familiar others. In the current study, 41 adolescents were asked to make judgments about trait adjectives during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): they had to indicate whether the word describes themselves, their friends, their teachers or politicians. Findings indicate a greater overlap in neural networks for responses to self- and friend-related judgments compared to teachers and politicians. In particular, classic self-reference structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial posterior parietal cortex also exhibited higher activation to judgments about friends. In contrast, brain responses towards judgments of teachers (familiar others) compared to politicians (unfamiliar others) did not significantly differ. Results support behavioral findings of a greater relevance of friends for the development of a self-concept during adolescence and indicate underlying functional brain processes.

701,"Decreased neural plasticity is observed with healthy ageing in the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex thought to participate in motor learning and memory consolidation processes. In the present magnetoencephalography study, the post-training reorganization of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and its relation with motor learning and early consolidation in 14 young (19-30 years) and 14 old (66-70 years) healthy participants were investigated. At the behavioral level, participants were trained on a motor sequence learning task then retested 20-30 min later for transient offline gains in performance. Using a sensorimotor seed-based approach, rsFC relying on beta band power envelope correlation was estimated immediately before and 10 min after the learning episode. Post-training changes in rsFC (from before to after learning) were correlated with motor learning performance and with the offline improvement in performance within the hour after learning. Young and old participants exhibited differential patterns of sensorimotor-related rsFC, bearing specific relationships with motor learning and consolidation. Our findings suggest that rsFC changes following learning reflect the offline processing of the new motor skill and contribute to the early memory consolidation within the hour after learning. Furthermore, differences in post-training changes in rsFC between young and old participants support the hypothesis that ageing modulates the neural circuits underlying the learning of a new motor skill and the early subsequent consolidation stages.

702,"BACKGROUND
Motivation for high-fat food is thought to contribute to excess caloric intake in obese individuals. A novel regulator of motivation for food may be neuromedin U (NMU), a highly-conserved neuropeptide that influences food intake. Although these effects of NMU have primarily been attributed to signaling in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), NMU has also been found in other brain regions involved in both feeding behavior and motivation. We investigate the effects of NMU on motivation for food and food intake, and identify the brain regions mediating these effects.


METHODS
The motivational state for a particular reinforcer (e.g., high-fat food) can be assessed using a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement under which an increasing number of lever presses are required to obtain subsequent reinforcers. Here, we have used a progressive-ratio operant responding paradigm in combination with an assessment of cumulative food intake to evaluate the effects of NMU administration in rats, and identify the brain regions mediating these effects.


RESULTS
We found that peripheral administration of NMU decreases operant responding for high-fat food in rats. Evaluation of Fos-like immunoreactivity in response to peripheral NMU indicated the PVN and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as sites of action for NMU. NMU infusion into either region mimics the effects of peripheral NMU on food intake and operant responding for food. NMU-containing projections from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the PVN and DRN were identified as an endogenous source of NMU.


CONCLUSIONS
These results identify the DRN as a site of action for NMU, demonstrate that the LH provides endogenous NMU to the PVN and DRN and implicate NMU signaling in the PVN and DRN as a novel regulator of motivation for high-fat foods.",27748746,2017,Regulation of motivation for food by neuromedin U in the paraventricular nucleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus.
703,"Neurobehavioral models of pedophilia and child sexual offending suggest a pattern of temporal and in particular prefrontal disturbances leading to inappropriate behavioral control and subsequently an increased propensity to sexually offend against children. However, clear empirical evidence for such mechanisms is still missing. Using a go/nogo paradigm in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we compared behavioral performance and neural response patterns among three groups of men matched for age and IQ: pedophiles with (N = 40) and without (N = 37) a history of hands-on sexual offences against children as well as healthy non-offending controls (N = 40). As compared to offending pedophiles, non-offending pedophiles exhibited superior inhibitory control as reflected by significantly lower rate of commission errors. Group-by-condition interaction analysis also revealed inhibition-related activation in the left posterior cingulate and the left superior frontal cortex that distinguished between offending and non-offending pedophiles, while no significant differences were found between pedophiles and healthy controls. Both areas showing distinct activation pattern among pedophiles play a critical role in linking neural networks that relate to effective cognitive functioning. Data therefore suggest that heightened inhibition-related recruitment of these areas as well as decreased amount of commission errors is related to better inhibitory control in pedophiles who successfully avoid committing hands-on sexual offences against children.

The main objectives of this positron emission tomography (PET) study were to investigate the serotonin transporter binding potential (SERT BPND ) in patients with ADHD and to assess associations of SERT BPND between the brain regions. 25 medication-free patients with ADHD (age ± SD; 32.39 ± 10.15; 10 females) without any psychiatric comorbidity and 25 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (33.74 ± 10.20) were measured once with PET and the highly selective and specific radioligand [11 C]DASB. SERT BPND maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BPND of the investigated ROIs (P < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BPND and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R2  = 0.284, R2  = 0.167, Ps < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling. Altered interregional coupling between brain regions might be a sensitive approach to demonstrate functional and molecular alterations in psychiatric conditions.

We hypothesized that those classes with accumulating exposure to different types of childhood victimization (e.g., poly-victimization) would endorse higher suicidal behavior, than the other less severe classes, and those in the most severe class with higher anger trait would have stronger association with suicidal behavior. Respondents were 346 adults (N=346; Mage=35.0years; 55.9% female) who had experienced a lifetime traumatic event. Sixty four percent had experienced poly-victimization (four or more victimization experiences) and 38.8% met the cut-off score for suicidal behavior. Three distinct classes emerged namely, the Least victimization (Class 1), the Predominantly crime and sibling/peer victimization (Class 2), and the Poly-victimization (Class 3) classes. Regression analysis controlling for age and gender indicated that only the main effect of anger was significantly associated with suicidal behavior. The interaction term suggested that those in the Poly-victimization class were higher on suicidal behavior as a result of a stronger association between anger and suicidal behavior in contrast to the association found in Class 2. Clinical implications of findings entail imparting anger management skills to facilitate wellbeing among adult with childhood poly-victimization experiences.",27780110,2016,Latent classes of childhood poly-victimization and associations with suicidal behavior among adult trauma victims: Moderating role of anger.
707,"BACKGROUND
The diffusion tensor imaging technique (DTI) combined with tractography methods, has achieved the tridimensional reconstruction of white matter tracts in the brain. It allows their characterization in vivo in a non-invasive way. However, one of the largest sources of variability originates from the location of regions of interest, is therefore necessary schemes which make it possible to establish a protocol to be insensitive to variations in drawing thereof. The purpose of this paper is to stablish a reliable protocol to reconstruct ten prominent tracts of white matter and characterize them according to volume, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. Also we explored the relationship among these factors with gender and hemispheric symmetry.


METHODS
This study aims to characterize ten prominent tracts of white matter in a representative sample of Cuban population using this technique, including 84 healthy subjects. Diffusion tensors and subsequently fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were calculated from each subject's DTI scans. The trajectory of ten brain tracts was estimated by using deterministic tractography methods of fiber tracking. In such tracts, the volume, the FA and MD were calculated, creating a reference for their study in the Cuban population. The interactions between these variables with age, cerebral hemispheres and gender factors were explored using Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance.


RESULTS
The volume values showed that a most part of tracts have bigger volume in left hemisphere. Also, the data showed bigger values of MD for males than females in all the tracts, an inverse behavior than FA values.


CONCLUSIONS

709,"Although researchers have found that child welfare placement disruptions are associated with elevated youth physical and mental health problems, the mechanisms that explain this association have not been previously studied. The present study built on a previous investigation of the physical and behavioral consequences of long-term permanent placement patterns among youth who participated in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). The current investigation (n=251) aimed to (a) report the early adolescent living situations of youth with different long-term placement patterns, and (b) to delineate the roles of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and post-traumatic stress (PTS) reactions in the association between unstable long-term placement patterns and physical and mental health problems during the transition to adolescence. Information about youth's living situations, ACEs, and physical and mental health was gathered prospectively from child protective services records and biannual caregiver and youth interviews when youth were 4-14 years old. The majority of youth remained with the same caregiver during early adolescence, but youth with chronically unstable permanent placement patterns continued to experience instability. Path analyses revealed that ACEs mediated the association between unstable placement patterns and elevated mental, but not physical, health problems during late childhood. Additionally, late childhood PTS mediated the association between unstable placement patterns and subsequent escalations in physical and mental health problems during the transition to adolescence. Findings highlight the importance of long-term permanency planning for youth who enter the child welfare system and emphasize the importance of trauma-focused assessment and intervention for these youth.",27794244,2016,Unstable child welfare permanent placements and early adolescent physical and mental health: The roles of adverse childhood experiences and post-traumatic stress.

712,"In Streptococcus mutans, an oral colonizer associated with dental caries, development of competence for natural genetic transformation is triggered by either of two types of peptide pheromones, competence-stimulating peptides (CSPs) (18 amino acids [aa]) or SigX-inducing peptides (XIPs) (7 aa). Competence induced by CSP is a late response to the pheromone that requires the response regulator ComE and the XIP-encoding gene comS. XIP binds to ComR to allow expression of the alternative sigma factor SigX and the effector genes it controls. While these regulatory links are established, the precise set of effectors controlled by each regulator is poorly defined. To improve the definition of all three regulons, we used a high-resolution tiling array to map global changes in gene expression in the early and late phases of the CSP response. The early phase of the CSP response was limited to increased gene expression at four loci associated with bacteriocin production and immunity. In the late phase, upregulated regions expanded to a total of 29 loci, including comS and genes required for DNA uptake and recombination. The results indicate that the entire late response to CSP depends on the expression of comS and that the immediate transcriptional response to CSP, mediated by ComE, is restricted to just four bacteriocin-related loci. Comparison of the new data with published transcriptome data permitted the identification of all of the operons in each regulon: 4 for ComE, 2 for ComR, and 21 for SigX. Finally, a core set of 27 panstreptococcal competence genes was identified within the SigX regulon by comparison of transcriptome data from diverse streptococcal species.

713,"Dynamical behavior and the stability of eighteen nanostructures composed of cyclic peptide (CP) with the general structure of the cyclo(CO(CH2)n=4, 6, 10COCyst), in the gas phase, water and chloroform were investigated during 50ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. CP dimers and cyclic peptide nanotubes (CPNTs) are more stable in chloroform than water and this stability is reversely correlated with the ring size of the CP units. Also the effect of glucose derivatives substitution, d-glucose (S1) and N-methyl-d-glucamine (S2), on the stability and other physicochemical properties of the CP dimers and CPNTs were evaluated. These substitutions increase the inner-subunits hydrogen bonds (H-bond) which in turn increase the stability of these structures. Moreover, the S2 substitution in comparison to the S1 makes dimers and CPNTs more stable. Gibbs free energy analysis based on the MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA calculations confirmed that substitutions affect the stability of the studied nanostructures, considerably and an increase in the length of the CPNT units reduces their stability. Quantum chemistry calculations on the dimer structures using the density functional theory (DFT) and DFT-D3 methods were performed. Based on the DFT-D3 calculations, it was revealed that the dispersion interactions play a key role in the dimerization process. The ring size increment, elevates the dispersion interaction energy which is accordance with the MD results. H-bond formation between the CO and NH groups of the CP units inside the dimers have been analyzed by using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital description.

The diffusion behavior of water molecules in blends were investigated from the aspects of the diffusion coefficient, free volume, pair correlation function (PCF) and trajectories of water molecules, respectively. And the hydrophilicity of blend composite was studied based on the contact angle and equilibrium water content (EWC) of the blend films. The simulation results show that the diffusion coefficient of water molecules and fractional free volume (FFV) of blend membranes increase with the addition of PAM, and a higher temperature can also improve the diffusion of water molecules. Additionally, the analysis of PCFs reveals the main reason why the diffusion coefficient of water in blend system increases with the addition of PAM.

717,"Non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance recovery after stroke. However, fundamental knowledge about how tDCS impacts neural processing in the lesioned human brain is currently lacking. In the present study, it was investigated how tDCS modulates brain function in patients with post-stroke language impairment (aphasia). In a cross-over, randomized trial, patients named pictures of common objects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Concurrently, excitatory (anodal-) or sham-tDCS (1 mA, 20 min, or 30 s, respectively) was administered to the left primary motor cortex, a montage with demonstrated potential to improve aphasic language. By choosing stimuli that could reliable be named by the patients, the authors aimed to derive a pure measure of stimulation effects that was independent of treatment or performance effects and to assess how tDCS interacts with the patients' residual language network. Univariate fMRI data analysis revealed reduced activity in domain-general regions mediating high-level cognitive control during anodal-tDCS. Independent component functional network analysis demonstrated selectively increased language network activity and an inter-correlated shift from higher to lower frequency bands, indicative of increased within-network communication. Compared with healthy controls, anodal-tDCS resulted in overall ""normalization"" of brain function in the patients. These results demonstrate for the first time how tDCS modulates neural processing in stroke patients. Such information is crucial to assure that behavioral treatments targeting specific neural circuits overlap with regions that are modulated by tDCS, thereby maximizing stimulation effects during therapy.

A cross-sectional correlational design was used to describe and compare CVD risk and cardiac mortality in White Hispanic and non-Hispanic women and men. Data from 3,317 individuals (1,523 women and 1,794 men) hospitalized for non-cardiac causes during 2012-2013, and data from the 2010 United States Census were included. The sex-specific 10-year Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FRS-10) was used to estimate long-term risk for major cardiac events. Approximately three-quarters of the sample was White Hispanic. FRS-10 scores were generally low, but a high prevalence of risk factors not included in the standard FRS-10 scoring formula was seen. White Hispanic women had significantly lower estimated CVD risk scores compared to White Hispanic and non-Hispanic men despite higher non-FRS-10 risks. Neighborhood median household income had a significant negative relationship and Hispanic neighborhood concentration had a significant positive relationship with cardiac mortality. Hispanic concentration was the only predictor of estimated CVD risk in a multilevel model. CVD risk assessment tools that are calibrated for ethnic groups and socioeconomic status may be more appropriate for Hispanic individuals than the FRS-10. Neighborhood-level factors should be included in clinical cardiac assessment in addition to individual characteristics and behavioral risks. Researchers should continue to seek additional risk factors that may contribute to or protect against CVD in order to close the gap between estimated CVD risk and actual cardiac mortality for Hispanics in the US. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27862050,2017,Impact of Individual and Neighborhood Factors on Cardiovascular Risk in White Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Women and Men.

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of the Stroke Counseling for Risk Reduction (SCORRE) intervention, a tailored, theory-based intervention consisting of a motivational video of young African American stroke survivors, the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7® (LS7) risk assessment and education tool, and a 6-week behavioral risk reduction diary. Feasibility and changes in theoretical variables were evaluated over 6 weeks. In four months, 30 participants were enrolled and randomized and 29 (97%) completed the study. Participants averaged 23 years old, most were female university students, and they had an average of 2.1 out of 7 risk factors for stroke. Only 7% had missing items on questionnaires, and 17% had missing daily diary entries. Although statistical significance of differences was not assessed, both intervention and control groups had improvements in knowledge scores following the initial session, and larger improvements in accuracy of perceived stroke risk and in health behaviors (physical activity and diet quality) were observed among participants receiving SCORRE. An exit survey indicated the majority of participants receiving SCORRE were motivated to achieve better health; enjoyed the video, LS7 and diary; and felt the program length was appropriate. Results suggest that SCORRE is feasible and acceptable, and with additional refinement and further testing has potential for reducing stroke risk among African Americans. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27862055,2017,Reducing Stroke Risk Among Young Adult African Americans: A Feasibility Study.
720,"Although past research has highlighted the possibility of a direct relationship between the age of nursing professionals and burnout syndrome, results have been far from conclusive. The aim of this study was to conduct a wider analysis of the influence of age on the three dimensions of burnout syndrome (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) in nurses. We performed a meta-analysis of 51 publications extracted from health sciences and psychology databases that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were 47 reports of information on emotional exhaustion in 50 samples, 39 reports on depersonalization for 42 samples, and 31 reports on personal accomplishment in 34 samples. The mean effect sizes indicated that younger age was a significant factor in the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization of nurses, although it was somewhat less influential in the dimension of personal accomplishment. Because of heterogeneity in the effect sizes, moderating variables that might explain the association between age and burnout were also analyzed. Gender, marital status, and study characteristics moderated the relationship between age and burnout and may be crucial for the identification of high-risk groups. More research is needed on other variables for which there were only a small number of studies.

Community pharmacists are well-positioned to address the US opioid medication crisis, which has created a need to detect misuse risk in order to provide optimal patient care.


OBJECTIVES
This study sought to identify community pharmacy patient subgroups at risk for opioid medication misuse.


METHODS
This study was a cross-sectional survey that examined behavioral, mental, and physical health characteristics among patients filling opioid pain medications. A convenience sample of adult patients filling opioid pain medications who were not receiving cancer treatment were screened in 2 urban and 2 rural community pharmacies in southwestern Pennsylvania. Patient subgroups were identified using latent class analysis. Latent class regression analysis was used to examine the association between subgroup membership and misuse.


RESULTS
A total of 333 patients completed the survey (response rate 71.4%). Latent class analysis results showed that a 3-class solution best fit the data, which were labeled: mental health (8.4%, n = 28), poor health (79.6%, n = 265), and hazardous alcohol use (12%, n = 40). Individuals within the mental health subgroup had an increased risk for opioid medication misuse (Odds Ratio = 6.23, 95% CI = 5.13-7.33).


CONCLUSION
These findings demonstrate heterogeneity of this population receiving prescribed opioids and the potential to identify subgroups with high misuse risk. These findings also support routine screening of patients filling opioid medications and suggest the need for evidence-based patient-centered intervention development.",27876595,2017,"Behavioral, mental, and physical health characteristics and opioid medication misuse among community pharmacy patients: A latent class analysis."
722,"Herbivore communities are shaped by indirect plant-mediated interactions whose outcomes are strongly dependent on the sequence of herbivore arrival. However, the mechanisms underlying sequence specificity are poorly understood. We examined the mechanisms that govern sequence-specific effects of the interaction between two specialist maize herbivores, the leaf feeder Spodoptera frugiperda and the root feeder Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. In the field, S. frugiperda reduces D. v. virgifera abundance, but only when it arrives on the plant first. In behavioral experiments, D. v. virgifera larvae continued feeding on plants that they had infested before leaf infestation, but refused to initiate feeding on plants that were infested by S. frugiperda before their arrival. Changes in root-emitted volatiles were sufficient to elicit this sequence-specific behavior. Root volatile and headspace mixing experiments showed that early-arriving D. v. virgifera larvae suppressed S. frugiperda-induced volatile repellents, which led to the maintenance of host attractiveness to D. v. virgifera. Our study provides a physiological and behavioral mechanism for sequence specificity in plant-mediated interactions and suggests that physiological canalization of behaviorally active metabolites can drive sequence specificity and result in strongly diverging herbivore distribution patterns.",27898177,2017,A mechanism for sequence specificity in plant-mediated interactions between herbivores.

The methods employed for comprehensive behavioral phenotyping and pharmacological experiments are complex and should be conducted exclusively by trained technicians with demonstrated proficiency. The ultimate goal is to identify disease-relevant and translational behavioral endpoints that are robust, reliable, and reproducible, and that can be employed to evaluate potential of novel therapeutic agents to treat disease.

725,"INTRODUCTION
A gene-environment interaction between expression genotypes of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and adverse childhood experience increases the risk of antisocial behavior. However, the neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A cortico-limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is modulated by serotonin (5-HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) challenges 5-HT regulation and may identify vulnerable neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene-environment interaction.


METHODS
Functional magnetic resonance imaging measured the resting-state state activity in 64 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Cortical maps of amygdala correlation identified the impact of ATD and its interaction with low- (MAOA-L) and high-expression variants (MAOA-H) of MAOA on cortico-limbic connectivity.


RESULTS
Across all Regions of Interest (ROIs) exhibiting an ATD effect on cortico-limbic connectivity, MAOA-L carriers were more susceptible to ATD than MAOA-H carriers. In particular, the MAOA-L group exhibited a larger reduction of amygdala connectivity with the right prefrontal cortex and a larger increase of amygdala connectivity with the insula and dorsal PCC.


CONCLUSION
MAOA-L carriers were more susceptable to a central 5-HT challenge in cortico-limbic networks. Such vulnerability of the cortical serotonergic system may contribute to the emergence of antisocial behavior after systemic challenges, observed as gene-environment interaction.

726,"We present ab-initio scrutiny of electron transport through C20 fullerene cleaved with gold electrodes having unique set of miller orientations. The three families of miller indices {100}, {110} and {111} are considered with four exclusive device models for elucidating electronic transport under applied potential of - 2 to +2V. Thereafter, the quantum calculations employing DFT-NEGF are performed for envisaging density of states, transmission function, energy levels, molecular orbitals, charge transfer. These electronic transfer parameters lead to the study of its two electrical parameters: current and conductance. We conclude that in molecular-devices of constituted miller family {110}, HOMO-LUMO gap are inversely proportional to extent of charge carriers. While for miller devices {100} and {111}, the situation is fully contrasting with HOMO-LUMO gap being directly proportional to its charge carriers. Another important conclusion is that the gold electrodes having miller family {100} and {111} are providing equal opportunity to fullerene molecule to imply its behavior while electrodes of miller family {110} are over shadowing the performance of fullerene molecule.",27939930,2017,Proliferating miller indices of C20 fullerene device under DFT-NEGF regime.

728,"The psychostimulants amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (MA) are widely abused illicit drugs. Here we show that both psychostimulants acutely increase NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic currents and decrease AMPA receptor (AMPAR)/NMDAR ratios in midbrain dopamine neurons. The potentiation depends on the transport of AMPH into the cell by the dopamine transporter. NMDAR-GluN2B receptor inhibitors, ifenprodil, RO 25-6981, and RO 04-5595, inhibit the potentiation without affecting basal-evoked NMDA currents, indicating that NMDAR-GluN2B receptors are activated by AMPH. A selective peptide inhibitor of AMPH-dependent trafficking of the neuronal excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) blocks potentiation, suggesting that EAAT3 internalization increases extracellular glutamate concentrations and activates GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Experiments with the use-dependent NMDAR blocker, MK-801, indicate that potentiated NMDARs reside on the plasma membrane and are not inserted de novo. In behavioral studies, GluN2B inhibitors reduce MA-mediated locomotor activity, without affecting basal activity. These results reveal an important interaction between dopamine and glutamatergic signaling in midbrain dopamine neurons in response to acute administration of psychostimulants.",27976681,2017,Amphetamine and Methamphetamine Increase NMDAR-GluN2B Synaptic Currents in Midbrain Dopamine Neurons.
729,"Objectives The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence regarding the use of motivational interviewing in the context of general dental practice, in order that practitioners can decide whether it might be an important skill to develop within their practices.Data sources The results reported in this study form part of a larger systematic review which sought to identify whether oral health promotion within dental practice is effective and how its effects can be optimised. Here, we focus on the papers describing motivational interviewing in dental practice published since 1994. The systematic review included searches of 20 online resources (including Ovid Medline and Embase).Data selection Papers which were not about oral health promotion and did not apply the behavioural and psychological theories, which underpin motivational interviewing, were excluded.Data synthesis This review included eight papers all of which were considered to be of robust quality, in terms of their research methods and seven of which were considered to offer externally valid findings. Five described randomised controlled trials and all of these RCTs demonstrated that interventions including motivational interviewing had a positive effect on oral health and health behaviour.Conclusions This review shows that the motivational interviewing technique, which is based on the concept of autonomy support, has potential for helping patients with poor oral health.

730,"The Acheulean is the longest-lasting human cultural record, spanning approximately 1.5 Ma and three continents. The most comprehensive sequences are found in East Africa, where, in largescale syntheses, the Lower Pleistocene Acheulean (LPA) has often been considered a uniform cultural entity. Furthermore, the emergence and development of Acheulean technology are seen as linked to the emergence and evolution of Homo ergaster/erectus. The criterion for grouping together different lithic assemblages scattered over space and time is the presence of large cutting tools (LCTs), more than of any other component. Their degree of refinement has been used, in turn, as a parameter for evaluating Acheulean development and variability. But was the East African LPA really uniform as regards all components involved in lithic productions? The aim of this paper is to evaluate the techno-economic similarities and differences among LPA productions in a specific micro-regional and environmental context, i.e. at Melka Kunture, in the Ethiopian highlands, and in a specific period of time: between ≈1.5 Ma, when some of the earliest Acheulean complexes appeared, and 1.0-0.85 Ma, when LCTs productions became intensive and widespread. Our detailed comparative analyses investigate all aspects and phases of the chaînes opératoires. Since hominin fossil remains were discovered at some of the analyzed sites, we also discuss differences among lithic productions in relation to the changing paleoanthropological record. Our studies show that at Melka Kunture the LPA techno-complexes cannot be grouped into a single uniform entity. The assembled evidence points instead to ""two Acheuleans"" well-defined by a strong discontinuity in various aspects of techno-economic behaviors. This discontinuity is related to a major step in human evolution: the transition from Homo ergaster/ erectus to Homo heidelbergensis.",27983519,2017,"Two Acheuleans, two humankinds: From 1.5 to 0.85 Ma at Melka Kunture (Upper Awash, Ethiopian highlands)."
731,"BACKGROUND
Chronic psychological distress appears to have increased in recent years, mainly among the working population. The data available indicate that mental and behavioral disorders, including burnout syndrome, represent not only a personal problem for those afflicted, but also a serious public health issue. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of an outpatient burnout prevention program in a mono-center health resort setting.


METHODS
Adults experiencing an above-average level of stress and thus being at an increased risk of burnout were randomized either to the intervention group (IG) or the waiting control group (WG). The 3-week program included stress management intervention, relaxation, physical exercise and moor applications. The primary outcome was change in perceived stress (PSQ) at 6 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included burnout symptoms, well-being, health status, psychological symptoms, back pain, and number of sick days. Participants were examined at baseline, post-intervention (3 weeks) and after 1, 3 and 6 months.


RESULTS
Data from 88 adults (IG=43; WG=45) were available for (per protocol) analysis (mean age: 50.85; 76.1% female). Participants in the IG experienced significant immediate improvement in all outcome measures, which declined somewhat during the first three months post-intervention and then remained stable for at least another three months. Those in the WG did not experience substantial change across time. For the 109 randomized persons, results for PSQ were confirmed in an intention-to-treat analysis with missing values replaced by last observation carried forward (between-group ANCOVA for PSQScore at 6 months, parameter estimator for the group: -20.57; 95% CI: [-26.09; -15.04]). Large effect sizes (Cohen's d for PSQ: 1.09-1.72) indicate the superiority of the intervention.


CONCLUSION
The program proved to be effective in reducing perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and other targets. Future research should examine the long-term impact of the program and the effect of occasional refresher training.",27989278,2016,The Effectiveness of a Stress Reduction and Burnout Prevention Program.
732,"Two sets of isostructural mononuclear compounds, [Ln(LOMe)2(H2O)2](PF6) [1, Ln = Er; 3, Ln = Gd; LOMe = CpCo{P(O)(O(CH3))2}3] and Ln(LOMe)2(NO3) (2, Ln = Er and 4, Ln = Gd), are synthesized by self-assembly of the respective lanthanide ions and tripodal chelate ligands. The Ln ions are encircled by two LOMe ligands, and two water molecules or one nitrate anion. Each octacoordinated Ln center adopts a distorted square antiprism geometry. The Er complex (2) chelated by a nitrate anion shows slow dynamics in magnetic relaxation, diagnostic of a single-ion magnet. Quantum tunneling in 2 is effectively blocked by application of an external field. Weak intermolecular magnetic interactions occur in 2, and are supported by the magnetic behavior of 4. Chemical dilution of Er with the diamagnetic Y ion can nullify magnetic interactions and suppress quantum tunneling. Generation of slow relaxation dynamics in the Er system is related to the anisotropic charge distribution supplied by the coordination of ligands with different charge densities, as observed in the Dy analogue. This suggests that magnetic anisotropy arises in a coordination system when an anisotropic lanthanide ion (Dy and Er) is surrounded by a ligand environment with anisotropic charge density, resulting in slow magnetic relaxation.",27991622,2017,Slow relaxation dynamics of a mononuclear Er(iii) complex surrounded by a ligand environment with anisotropic charge density.

METHODS
Participants were a nationally representative sample of 90 118 US students aged 12 to 18 years who were involved in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Violence was assessed by having participants report the number of times in the preceding 12 months they had been involved in a serious physical fight, had hurt someone badly, and had pulled a weapon on someone.


RESULTS
Participants were 48% more likely to have been involved in a serious fight, 183% more likely to have hurt someone badly, and 140% more likely to have pulled a weapon on someone if a friend had engaged in the same behavior. The influence spread up to 4 degrees of separation (i.e., friend of friend of friend of friend) for serious fights, 2 degrees for hurting someone badly, and 3 degrees for pulling a weapon on someone.

734,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory noninvasive brain stimulation tool with potential to increase or reduce regional and remote cortical excitability. Numerous studies have shown the ability of this technique to induce neuroplasticity and to modulate cognition and behavior in adults. Clinical studies have also demonstrated the ability of tDCS to induce therapeutic effects in several central nervous system disorders. However, knowledge about its ability to modulate brain functions in children or induce clinical improvements in pediatrics is limited. The objective of this review is to describe relevant data of some recent studies that may help to understand the potential of this technique in children with specific regard to effective and safe treatment of different developmental disorders in pediatrics. Overall, the results show that standard protocols of tDCS are well tolerated by children and have promising clinical effects. Nevertheless, treatment effects seem to be partially heterogeneous, and a case of a seizure in a child with previous history of infantile spasms and diagnosed epilepsy treated with tDCS for spasticity was reported. Further research is needed to determine safety criteria for tDCS use in children and to elucidate the particular neurophysiological changes induced by this neuromodulatory technique when it is applied in the developing brain.",27997354,2017,Applications of transcranial direct current stimulation in children and pediatrics.

737,"OBJECTIVE
Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels constitute a family of cation channels that exhibit a regional and cell-specific expression pattern throughout the brain. It has been reported previously that TRPC3 channels are effectors of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/trkB signaling pathway. Given the long postulated role of BDNF in epileptogenesis, TRPC3 channels may be a critical component in the underlying pathophysiology of seizure and epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the precise role of TRPC3 channels in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE).


METHODS
The role of TRPC3 channels was investigated using TRPC3 knockout (KO) mice and TRPC3-selective inhibitor Pyr3. Video and electroencephalography (EEG) recording of pilocarpine-induced seizures were performed.


RESULTS
We found that genetic ablation of TRPC3 channels reduces behavioral manifestations of seizures and the root-mean-square (RMS) power of SE, indicating a significant contribution of TRPC3 channels to pilocarpine-induced SE. Furthermore, the reduction in SE in TRPC3KO mice is caused by a selective attenuation of pilocarpine-induced theta activity, which dominates both the preictal phase and SE phase. Pyr3 also caused a reduction in the overall RMS power of pilocarpine-induced SE and a selective reduction in the theta activity during SE.

These endogenous rhythms dampen with age and thus compromise temporal coordination. Feeding-fasting patterns are an external cue that profoundly influence the robustness of daily biological rhythms. Erratic eating patterns can disrupt the temporal coordination of metabolism and physiology leading to chronic diseases that are also characteristic of aging. However, sustaining a robust feeding-fasting cycle, even without altering nutrition quality or quantity, can prevent or reverse these chronic diseases in experimental models. In humans, epidemiological studies have shown erratic eating patterns increase the risk of disease, whereas sustained feeding-fasting cycles, or prolonged overnight fasting, is correlated with protection from breast cancer. Therefore, optimizing the timing of external cues with defined eating patterns can sustain a robust circadian clock, which may prevent disease and improve prognosis.",28017879,2017,"Circadian rhythms, time-restricted feeding, and healthy aging."
740,"Several studies have aimed to address the natural inability of humankind to detect deception and accurately discriminate lying from truth in the legal context. To date, it has been well established that telling a lie is a complex mental activity. During deception, many functions of higher cognition are involved: the decision to lie, withholding the truth, fabricating the lie, monitoring whether the receiver believes the lie, and, if necessary, adjusting the fabricated story and maintaining a consistent lie. In the previous 15 years, increasing interest in the neuroscience of deception has resulted in new possibilities to investigate and interfere with the ability to lie directly from the brain. Cognitive psychology, as well as neuroimaging and neurostimulation studies, are increasing the possibility that neuroscience will be useful for lie detection. This paper discusses the scientific validity of the literature on neuroimaging and neurostimulation regarding lie detection to understand whether scientific findings in this field have a role in the forensic setting. We considered how lie detection technology may contribute to addressing the detection of deception in the courtroom and discussed the conditions and limits in which these techniques reliably distinguish whether an individual is lying.",28030362,2017,The guilty brain: the utility of neuroimaging and neurostimulation studies in forensic field.

742,"Two novel styrene-containing meta-carborane derivatives substituted at the second carbon cluster atom (Cc) with either a methyl (Me) or a phenyl (Ph) group are introduced herein along with a new set of stilbene-containing ortho- (o-) and meta- (m-) carborane dyads. The latter set of compounds have been prepared from styrene-containing carborane derivatives via a Heck coupling reaction. High regioselectivity has been achieved for these compounds by using a combination of palladium complexes [Pd2(dba)3]/[Pd(t-Bu3P)2] as a catalytic system, yielding exclusively E isomers. All compounds have been fully characterised and the crystal structures of seven of them were analysed by X-ray diffraction. The absorption spectra of these compounds are similar to those of their respective fluorophore groups (styrene or stilbene), showing a very small influence of the substituent (Me or Ph) linked to the second Cc atom or the cluster isomer (o- or m-). On the other hand, fluorescence spectroscopy revealed high emission intensities for Me-o-carborane derivatives, whereas their Ph-o-carborane analogues evidenced an almost total lack of fluorescence, confirming the significant role of the substituent bound to the adjacent Cc in o-carboranes. In contrast, all the m-carborane derivatives display similar photoluminescence (PL) behavior regardless of the substituent attached to the second Cc, demonstrating its small influence on emission properties. Additionally, m-carborane derivatives are significantly more fluorescent than their o-counterparts, reaching quantum yield values as high as 30.2%. Regarding solid state emission, only stilbene-containing Ph-o-carborane derivatives, which showed very low fluorescence in solution, exhibited notable PL emission in films attributed to aggregation-induced emission. DFT calculations were performed to successfully complement the photoluminescence studies, supporting the experimentally observed photophysical behavior of the styrene and stilbene-containing carborane derivatives. In conclusion, in this work it is proved that it is possible to tailor the PL properties of carborane-stilbene dyads by changing the Cc substituent and the carborane isomer.",28045166,2017,Carborane-stilbene dyads: the influence of substituents and cluster isomers on photoluminescence properties.
743,"Ag2Cu3Cr2O8(OH)4, a new Ag-Cu-Cr-O layered mixed oxide, prepared by soft hydrothermal heterogeneous reactions, is reported. The new phase is an oxyhydroxide and presents a structure with alternating brucite-like Cu-O and Ag-O layers connected by individual chromate groups. The crystallographic structure has been solved and refined from high resolution powder X-ray diffraction data and is supported by density functional theory calculations, yielding a triclinic, space group P1[combining macron], a = 5.3329(1) Å, b = 5.3871(1) Å, c = 10.0735(1) Å, α = 80.476(1)°, β = 87.020(1)°, γ = 62.383(1)°. Bond valence sums suggest the formulation of Ag+2Cu2+3Cr6+2O8(OH)4, an electronic state fully supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Cr K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements. Ag2Cu3Cr2O8(OH)4 exhibits bidimensional Cu-O-Cu ferromagnetic correlations that are apparent at much higher temperatures than in other similar Cu-O layered structures, without coupling between Cu-O layers, which represents a unique case in the recent family of silver copper oxides. The role of Ag inducing bidimensionality in copper oxides is therefore expanded further with the presence of chromate anions. Ab initio calculations using density functional theory show that the electronic states involved originate mainly from Cu and OH orbitals, with minor contributions from Cr and the O atoms linking the Cr tetrahedra to the brucitic Cu-O layer, and almost no contribution from Ag. Further modeling of the in-plane magnetic interactions between Cu atoms suggests that the coupled magnetized stripes are responsible for the observed behavior. The results are discussed in relation with previous Ag-Cu mixed oxide phases where metallic behavior or ferro-antiferro transitions had been observed. The structure of this new Ag-Cu-O phase as compared with previous silver copper oxides supports the conclusion that the Ag-Cu layered ordering is favored under oxidizing conditions.",28045173,2017,Ag2Cu3Cr2O8(OH)4: a new bidimensional silver-copper mixed-oxyhydroxide with in-plane ferromagnetic coupling.

745,"This study aims to characterize the psychological wellbeing of chronic headache (CH) patients, to identify cortical structural abnormalities and any associations of those abnormalities with resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), and to determine whether such rsFC abnormality is specific to CH patients. Compared with healthy controls (CONCH ), CH patients suffered from mild depression, sleep disturbances, and relatively poor quality of life. CH patients also exhibited widespread cortical thickness (CT) abnormalities in left premotor (BA6), right primary somatosensory (S1) and right prefrontal (BA10) cortices, as well as in regions of default mode and executive control networks. Using cortical regions with thickness abnormality as seeds, we found cortical region pairs showed strengthened rsFC in CH patients. Using the same seeds, rsFC analysis from chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and their controls (CONCLBP ) identified abnormalities in non-overlapping cortical region pairs. Direct comparison of rsFC between CH and CLBP patients revealed significantly differences in thirteen cortical region pairs, including the four identified in CH and CONCH comparison. Across all three groups (CH, CLBP and CON), the rsFC between left multisensory association area (BA39) and left posterior cingulate cortex (BA23) differed significantly. Eight regions showed CT abnormality in CLBP patients, two of which overlapped with those of CH patients. Our observations support the notion that CH and CLBP pain are pathological conditions, under which the brain develops distinct widespread structural and functional abnormalities. CH and CLBP groups share some similar structural abnormalities, but rsFC abnormalities in several cortical region pairs appear to be pathology-specific.

746,"We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a visual search paradigm to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with increased frontoparietal involvement in both target detection and bottom-up attentional guidance (featural salience). Participants were 68 healthy adults, distributed continuously across 19 to 78 years of age. Frontoparietal regions of interest (ROIs) were defined from resting-state scans obtained prior to task-related fMRI. The search target was defined by a conjunction of color and orientation. Each display contained one item that was larger than the others (i.e., a size singleton) but was not informative regarding target identity. Analyses of search reaction time (RT) indicated that bottom-up attentional guidance from the size singleton (when coincident with the target) was relatively constant as a function of age. Frontoparietal fMRI activation related to target detection was constant as a function of age, as was the reduction in activation associated with salient targets. However, for individuals 35 years of age and older, engagement of the left frontal eye field (FEF) in bottom-up guidance was more prominent than for younger individuals. Further, the age-related differences in left FEF activation were a consequence of decreasing resting-state functional connectivity in visual sensory regions. These findings indicate that age-related compensatory effects may be expressed in the relation between activation and behavior, rather than in the magnitude of activation, and that relevant changes in the activation-RT relation may begin at a relatively early point in adulthood.

747,"The coordination of the trivalent 4f ions, Ln = La3+, Dy3+, and Lu3+, with neutral and acidic organophosphorus reagents, both individually and combined, was studied by use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These studies provide metrical information about the interatomic interactions between these cations and the ligands tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) and di-n-butyl phosphoric acid (HDBP), whose behavior are of practical importance to chemical separation processes that are currently used on an industrial scale. Previous studies have suggested the existence of complexes involving a mixture of ligands, accounting for extraction synergy. Through systematic variation of the aqueous phase acidity and extractant concentration and combination, we have found that complexes with Ln and TBP : HDBP at any mixture and HDBP alone involve direct Ln-O interactions involving 6 oxygen atoms and distant Ln-P interactions involving on average 3-5 phosphorus atoms per Ln ion. It was also found that Ln complexes formed by TBP alone seem to favor eight oxygen coordination, though we were unable to obtain metrical results regarding the distant Ln-P interactions due to the low signal attributed to a lower concentration of Ln ions in the organic phases. Our study does not support the existence of mixed Ln-TBP-HDBP complexes but, rather, indicates that the lanthanides are extracted as either Ln-HDBP complexes or Ln-TBP complexes and that these complexes exist in different ratios depending on the conditions of the extraction system. This fundamental structural information offers insight into the solvent extraction processes that are taking place and are of particular importance to issues arising from the separation and disposal of radioactive materials from used nuclear fuel.",28054676,2017,Structural study of complexes formed by acidic and neutral organophosphorus reagents.
748,"Employing two benzoate derivatives with different numbers of non-coordinated fluoro-substituents, 2-fluorobenzoic acid (2-Hfba) and 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid (2,6-Hdfba), two new azido-copper coordination polymers, [Cu(2-fba)(N3)(CH3OH)]n (1) and [Cu(2,6-dfba)(N3)(CH3OH)]n (2), have been successfully isolated, and then structurally and magnetically investigated. Single crystal structure analysis demonstrates that the metal cations in the two resulting compounds are connected by the alternating triple-bridge of μ-1,1-azido, syn,syn-carboxylate and μ2-methanol, contributing to analogously linear 1D Cu(ii) chain-like motifs with slightly different intrachain and interchain geometric parameters. The fine-tuned structures lead to variant magnetic properties in the two title compounds. Although a dominant ferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Cu(ii) ions within each chain due to the counter-complementarity of the multiple superexchange pathways is observed in both compounds, the interesting plots of magnetic ordering and slow magnetic relaxation, which are rare in most of the reported azido-Cu(ii) architectures, only occur in compound 1, while 2 behaves as an antiferromagnet consisting of ferromagnetic Cu(ii) chains. The heat-capacity experiments further emphasize the characteristic long-range ferromagnetic ordering in 1 and the typical behavior of antiferromagnets in 2. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations (using different methods and basis sets) have been performed on both compounds to obtain the qualitatively theoretical interpretation of the magnetic behaviors.",28054687,2017,Coligand modifications fine-tuned the structure and magnetic properties of two triple-bridged azido-Cu(ii) chain compounds exhibiting ferromagnetic ordering and slow relaxation.
749,"Modern systems neuroscience increasingly leans on large-scale multi-lab neuroinformatics initiatives to provide necessary capacity for biologically realistic modeling of primate whole-brain activity. Here, we present a framework to assemble primate brain's biologically plausible anatomical backbone for such modeling initiatives. In this framework, structural connectivity is determined by adding complementary information from invasive macaque axonal tract tracing and non-invasive human diffusion tensor imaging. Both modalities are combined by means of available interspecies registration tools and a newly developed Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach to extract common connectivity evidence. We demonstrate how this novel framework is embedded in the whole-brain simulation platform called The Virtual Brain (TVB).

750,"The spatial location of an object can be represented in two frames of reference: egocentric (relative to the observer's body or body parts) and allocentric (relative to another object independent of the observer). The object positions relative to the two frames can be either congruent (e.g., both left or both right) or incongruent (e.g., one left and one right). Most of the previous studies, however, did not discriminate between the two types of spatial conflicts. To investigate the common and specific neural mechanisms underlying the spatial congruency effect induced by the two reference frames, we adopted a 3 (type of task: allocentric, egocentric, and color) × 2 (spatial congruency: congruent vs. incongruent) within-subject design in this fMRI study. The spatial congruency effect in the allocentric task was induced by the task-irrelevant egocentric representations, and vice versa in the egocentric task. The nonspatial color task was introduced to control for the differences in bottom-up stimuli between the congruent and incongruent conditions. Behaviorally, significant spatial congruency effect was revealed in both the egocentric and allocentric task. Neurally, the dorsal-medial visuoparietal stream was commonly involved in the spatial congruency effect induced by the task-irrelevant egocentric and allocentric representations. The right superior parietal cortex and the right precentral gyrus were specifically involved in the spatial congruency effect induced by the irrelevant egocentric and allocentric representations, respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that different subregions in the parieto-frontal network played different functional roles in the spatial interaction between the egocentric and allocentric reference frame.

751,"BACKGROUND
Sex with multiple partners (SMP) is one of the important contributing factors for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and young adults, especially among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) youth. Past studies mainly focus on examining associations of alcohol or club drugs use with unprotected sexual behaviors among adult homo/bisexual men, while little is known about the temporal association between marijuana use (MU) and SMP among LGB youth.


METHODS
This study examined the relationship between MU and SMP among LGB adolescents and young adults. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression analyses were utilized to analyze four waves' public-use Add Health data (N = 694, youth who reported a homo/bisexual status at any wave; Wave 1: aged 11-21; Wave 4: aged 24-32).


RESULTS
After adjusting for other substance use, current depression, mother-child relationship quality at Wave 1, and socioeconomic variables, past-year MU was both concurrently and prospectively associated with past-year SMP. The moderating effect of age was not found.


CONCLUSION
MU is concurrently and prospectively associated with increased odds of SMP in the adolescent sample and in the young adult sample. Findings imply that prevention/intervention on HIV risk behaviors may benefit from MU reduction not only in LGB adolescents but also in young adults.",28056883,2017,"Marijuana use and sex with multiple partners among lesbian, gay and bisexual youth: results from a national sample."

All compounds crystallize in the same space group of orthorhombic Cmcm with cell constants: Mn2GdInS5 (1), a = 3.789(1) Å, b = 12.411(1) Å, and c = 15.489(1) Å; Mn3Gd2S6 (2), a = 3.778(1) Å, b = 12.505(2) Å, and c = 19.114(2) Å; Mn4Gd2S7 (3), a = 3.769(1) Å, b = 12.466(2) Å, and c = 22.289(3) Å. Compounds 1-3 form a homologous series through the modulation of the MnS unit, whose structures represent a complete system of the corresponding lillianites (N1,N2L) of 3,3L, 4,4L and 5,5L. The gradually wider slabs formed in the series result in a monotonic increase along the c dimensions from 1 to 3. Crystal 3 is the first to achieve a predicted structure of 5,5L.

753,"Estrogens exert profound effects on the expression of anxiety in humans and rodents; however, the directionality of these effects varies considerably within both clinical and preclinical literature. It is believed that discrepancies regarding the nature of estrogens' effects on anxiety are attributable to the differential effects of specific estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes. In this chapter we will discuss the relative impact on anxiety and anxiety-like behavior of each of the three main ERs: ERα, which has a generally anxiogenic effect, ERβ, which has a generally anxiolytic effect, and the G-protein-coupled ER known as GPR30, which has been found to both increase and decrease anxiety-like behavior. In addition, we will describe the known mechanisms by which these receptor subtypes exert their influence on emotional responses, focusing on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the oxytocinergic and serotonergic systems. The impact of estrogens on the expression of anxiety is likely the result of their combined effects on all of these neurobiological systems.",28061972,2017,Estrogen Receptors Modulation of Anxiety-Like Behavior.
754,"The homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior requires an organism to be able to integrate information from its internal environment, including peripheral visceral signals about the body's current energy needs, with information from its external environment, such as the palatability of energy-rich food stimuli. The insula, which serves as the brain's primary sensory cortex for representing both visceral signals from the body and taste signals from the mouth and tongue, is a likely candidate region in which this integration might occur. However, to date it has been unclear whether information from these two homeostatically critical faculties is merely co-represented in the human insula, or actually integrated there. Recent functional neuroimaging evidence of a common substrate for visceral interoception and taste perception within the human dorsal mid-insula suggests a model whereby a single population of neurons may integrate viscerosensory and gustatory signals. To test this model, we used fMRI-Adaptation to identify whether insula regions that exhibit repetition suppression following repeated interoception trials would then also exhibit adapted responses to subsequent gustatory stimuli. Multiple mid and anterior regions of the insula exhibited adaptation to interoceptive trials specifically, but only the dorsal mid-insula regions exhibited an adapted gustatory response following interoception. The discovery of this gustatory-interoceptive convergence within the neurons of the human insula supports the existence of a heretofore-undocumented neural pathway by which visceral signals from the periphery modulate the activity of brain regions involved in feeding behavior.

756,"Phytoestrogens are plant derived, non-steroidal compounds naturally found in rodent chows that potentially have endocrine-disrupting effects. Isoflavones, the most common phytoestrogens, have a similar structure and molecular weight to 17β-estradiol (E2) and have the ability to bind and activate both isoforms of the estrogen receptor (ER). Most isoflavones have a higher affinity for ERβ, which is involved in sexually dimorphic behavioral regulation. The goal of this study was to examine the interaction of isoflavones and E2 presence in the OVX rat on anxiety- and depressive- like behavior and the related BDNF pathophysiology. E2 administration resulted in anxiogenic behaviors when isoflavones were present in the diet (p<0.05), but anxiolytic behaviors when isoflavones were not present (p<0.05). E2 resulted in antidepressive-like behaviors in animals fed an isoflavone-rich diet (p<0.05), with no effect when isoflavones were removed. Increased hippocampal BDNF expression was observed in animals fed an isoflavone-rich diet after E2 administration (p<0.05). BDNF expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus was increased after E2 treatment in animals fed an isoflavone-rich diet. Overall, these results demonstrate that the presence of dietary isoflavones can differentially regulate the effect of E2 replacement on behavior and BDNF expression.",28077306,2017,The interaction of dietary isoflavones and estradiol replacement on behavior and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the ovariectomized rat.

758,"Functional connectivity analysis has become a powerful tool for probing the human brain function and its breakdown in neuropsychiatry disorders. So far, most studies adopted resting-state paradigm to examine functional connectivity networks in the brain, thanks to its low demand and high tolerance that are essential for clinical studies. However, the test-retest reliability of resting-state connectivity measures is moderate, potentially due to its low behavioral constraint. On the other hand, naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms, an emerging approach for cognitive neuroscience with high ecological validity, could potentially improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures during a natural viewing condition, and benchmarked it against resting-state connectivity measures acquired within the same functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. We found that the reliability of connectivity and graph theoretical measures of brain networks is significantly improved during natural viewing conditions over resting-state conditions, with an average increase of almost 50% across various connectivity measures. Not only sensory networks for audio-visual processing become more reliable, higher order brain networks, such as default mode and attention networks, but also appear to show higher reliability during natural viewing. Our results support the use of natural viewing paradigms in estimating functional connectivity of brain networks, and have important implications for clinical application of fMRI.

759,"BACKGROUND
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are a consumer product whose benefits and risks are currently debated. Advocates of the ""tobacco harm reduction"" strategy emphasize their potential as an aid to smoking cessation, while advocates of the precautionary principle emphasize their risks instead. There have been only a few studies to date on the prevalence of e-cigarette use in Germany.


METHODS
In May 2016, in collaboration with Forsa, an opinion research firm, we carried out a survey among 4002 randomly chosen persons aged 14 and older, asking them about their consumption of e-cigarettes with and without nicotine, reasons for using e-cigarettes, plans for future use, estimation of danger compared to that of tobacco products, smoking behavior, and sociodemographic features.


RESULTS
1.4% of the respondents used e-cigarettes regularly, and a further 2.2% had used them regularly in the past. 11.8% had at least tried them, including 32.7% of smokers and 2.3% of persons who had never smoked. 24.5% of ex-smokers who had quit smoking after 2010 had used e-cigarettes at least once. 20.7% of the respondents considered electronic cigarettes less dangerous than conventional cigarettes, 46.3% equally dangerous, and 16.1% more dangerous. An extrapolation of these data to the general population suggests that about one million persons in Germany use e-cigarettes regularly and another 1.55 million have done so in the past.


CONCLUSION
The consumption of electronic cigarettes in Germany is not very widespread, but it is not negligible either. Nearly 1 in 8 Germans has tried e-cigarettes at least once. Regular consumers of e-cigarettes are almost exclusively smokers and ex-smokers.",28098063,2016,The Use of E-Cigarettes.
760,"Alexithymia is a personality trait characterized by difficulties in recognizing and verbalizing emotions and the utilization of a cognitive style that is oriented toward external events, rather than intrapsychic experiences. Alexithymia is considered a vulnerability factor influencing onset and course of many psychiatric disorders. Even though emotions are, in general, elicited involuntarily and emerge without conscious effort, it is surprising that little attention in etiological considerations concerning alexithymia has been given to deficits in automatic emotion processing and their neurobiological bases. In this article, results from studies using behavioral or neurobiological research methods were systematically reviewed in which automatic processing of external emotional information was investigated as a function of alexithymia in healthy individuals. Twenty-two studies were identified through a literature search of Psycinfo, PubMed, and Web of Science databases from 1990 to 2016. The review reveals deficits in the automatic processing of emotional stimuli in alexithymia at a behavioral and neurobiological level. The vast majority of the reviewed studies examined visual processing. The alexithymia facets externally oriented thinking and difficulties identifying feelings were found to be related to impairments in the automatic processing of threat-related facial expressions. Alexithymic individuals manifest low reactivity to barely visible negative emotional stimuli in brain regions responsible for appraisal, encoding, and affective response, e.g. amygdala, occipitotemporal areas, and insula. Against this background, it appears plausible to assume that deficits in automatic emotion processing could be factors contributing to alexithymic personality characteristics. Directions for future research on alexithymia and automatic emotion perception are suggested.",28099136,2017,Alexithymia and automatic processing of emotional stimuli: a systematic review.
761,"BACKGROUND
Survivors of stroke have long-term physical and psychological consequences that impact their quality of life. Few interventions are available in the community to address these problems. Yoga, a type of mindfulness-based intervention, is shown to be effective in people with other chronic illnesses and may have the potential to address many of the problems reported by survivors of stroke.


OBJECTIVES
To date only narrative reviews have been published. We sought to perform, the first systematic review with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated yoga for its potential benefit for chronic survivors of stroke.


METHODS
Ovid Medline, CINHAL plus, AMED, PubMed, PsychINFO, PeDro, Cochrane database, Sport Discuss, and Google Scholar were searched for papers published between January 1950 and August 2016. Reference lists of included papers, review articles and OpenGrey for Grey literature were also searched. We used a modified Cochrane tool to evaluate risk of bias. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed using the GRADE approach, results were collated, and random effects meta-analyses performed where appropriate.


RESULTS
The search yielded five eligible papers from four RCTs with small sample sizes (n = 17-47). Quality of RCTs was rated as low to moderate. Yoga is beneficial in reducing state anxiety symptoms and depression in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean differences for state anxiety 6.05, 95% CI:-0.02 to 12.12; p = 0.05 and standardized mean differences for depression: 0.50, 95% CI:-0.01 to 1.02; p = 0.05). Consistent but nonsignificant improvements were demonstrated for balance, trait anxiety, and overall quality of life.

762,"Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) is a widely used regression-based method to study connectivity changes in different experimental conditions. A PPI effect is generated by point-by-point multiplication of a psychological variable (experimental design) and a physiological variable (time series of a seed region). If the psychological variable is non-centered with a constant component, the constant component will add a physiological variable to the PPI term. The physiological component would in theory be accounted for by the physiological main effect in the model. But due to imperfect deconvolution and convolution with hemodynamic response function, the physiological component in PPI may no longer be exactly the same as the physiological main effect. This issue was illustrated by analyzing two block-designed fMRI datasets, one simple visual checkerboard task and a set of different tasks designed to activate different hemispheres. When PPI was calculated with deconvolution but without centering, significant results were usually observed between regions that are known to have baseline functional connectivity. These results could be suppressed by simply centering the psychological variable when calculating the PPI term or adding a deconvolve-reconvolved version of the physiological covariate. The PPI results with centering and with deconvolve-reconvolved physiological covariate are consistent with an explicit test for differences in coupling between conditions. It was, therefore, suggested that centering of the psychological variable or the addition of a deconvolve-reconvolved covariate is necessary for PPI analysis.

This study examined associations between the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and measures of depression, anxiety, eating disorder psychopathology, stress, and personality in a group of healthy adult females.


METHODS
Female participants (n = 91) ages 19-50 years with BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2 were recruited from central North Carolina between July 2014 and March 2015. Participants provided a single fecal sample and completed an online psychiatric questionnaire that included five measures: (i) Beck Anxiety Inventory; (ii) Beck Depression Inventory-II; (iii) Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire; (iv) Perceived Stress Scale; and (v) Mini International Personality Item Pool. Bacterial composition and diversity were characterized by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and associations were examined using Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient, in conjunction with Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate procedure.


RESULTS
We found no significant associations between microbial markers of gut composition and diversity and scores on psychiatric measures of anxiety, depression, eating-related thoughts and behaviors, stress, or personality in a large cohort of healthy adult females.


DISCUSSION
This study was the first specifically to examine associations between the intestinal microbiota and psychiatric measures in healthy females, and based on 16S rRNA taxonomic abundances and diversity measures, our results do not suggest a strong role for the enteric microbe-gut-brain axis in normal variation on responses to psychiatric measures in this population.

764,"BACKGROUND
Visuospatial neglect (VSN) is devastating and common after stroke, and is thought to involve functional disturbance of the attention network. Non-invasive theta-burst stimulation (TBS) may help restore the normal function of attention network, therefore facilitating recovery from VSN.


OBJECTIVE
This study investigated the effects of continuous TBS on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in the attention network, and behavioral performances of patients with VSN after stroke.


METHODS
Twelve patients were randomly assigned to receive 10-day cTBS of the left posterior parietal cortex delivered at 80% (the cTBS group), or 40% (the active control group) of the resting motor threshold. Both groups received daily visual scanning training and motor function treatment. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) and behavioral tests including line bisection test and star cancelation test were conducted at baseline and after the treatment.


RESULTS
At baseline, the two groups showed comparable results in the resting-state fMRI experiments and behavioral tests. After treatment, the cTBS group showed lower functional connectivity between right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and right anterior insula, and between right superior temporal sulcus and right anterior insula, as compared with the active control group; both groups showed improvement in the behavioral tests, with the cTBS group showing larger changes from baseline than the active control group.


CONCLUSION
cTBS of the left posterior parietal cortex in patients with VSN may induce changes in inter-regional RSFC in the right ventral attention network. These changes may be associated with improved recovery of behavioral deficits after behavioral training. The TPJ and superior temporal sulcus may play crucial roles in recovery from VSN.",28107807,2017,Continuous theta-burst stimulation may improve visuospatial neglect via modulating the attention network: a randomized controlled study.

Thirteen AWS received the intervention (AWS+), and 13 AWS did not receive the intervention (AWS-). There were 13 fluent controls (FC-). All participants were scanned before and after the intervention. Whole-brain analysis pre-intervention showed significant differences in task-related brain activation between AWS and FC- in the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and left middle temporal cortex, but there were no differences between the two AWS groups. Across the 7-day period of the intervention, AWS+ alone showed a significant increase of brain activation in the left ventral IFC/insula. There were no changes in brain function for the other two groups. Further analysis revealed that the change did not correlate with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) that AWS showed in the cerebellum (Lu et al., 2012). However, both changes in task-related brain function and RSFC correlated with changes in speech fluency level. Together, these findings suggest that functional reorganization in a brain region close to the left IFC that shows anomalous function in AWS, occurs after a short-term behavioral intervention for stuttering.",28113105,2017,Reorganization of brain function after a short-term behavioral intervention for stuttering.

Demographic and social characteristics, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and income, have been implicated as risk and protective factors for behavior change regarding obesogenic behaviors in adolescents. The purpose of this study was to determine the social disparities in obesogenic behaviors and compare social disparities in obesogenic behaviors between adolescents who are overweight/obese and non-overweight adolescents using an alternative methodology for calculating disparities.


METHODS
Data were obtained from the 2013 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Systems. Social disparities ratios for meeting fruit and vegetable recommendation, daily breakfast consumption, physical activity, and non-sedentary activity were calculated using the Extended Gastwirth Index Method. Independent sample t tests were used to compare social disparities between non-overweight and overweight/obese participants.


RESULTS
Racial disparities were the largest contributor to overall disparities for meeting fruit and vegetables recommendations, daily breakfast, and non-sedentary activity, while sex disparities were the largest contributor to overall disparities for meeting physical activity recommendations. The non-overweight group had lower free/reduced lunch disparities for all behaviors when compared to the overweight/obese group.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study confirmed that social disparities exist for obesogenic behaviors. The methodology allowed for the determination of the percentage change needed in behavior to eliminate disparities between groups. These calculations are a useful tool for identifying groups that should be targeted for intervention if disparities are to be reduced.",28130748,2018,Social Disparities in Obesogenic Behaviors in Adolescents.
767,"The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) have recently been shown to encode reward, but few studies have been performed in humans. We investigated STN and GPi encoding of reward and loss (i.e., valence) in humans with Parkinson's disease. To test the hypothesis that STN and GPi neurons would change their firing rate in response to reward- and loss-related stimuli, we recorded the activity of individual neurons while participants performed a behavioral task. In the task, action choices were associated with potential rewarding, punitive, or neutral outcomes. We found that STN and GPi neurons encode valence-related information during action control, but the proportion of valence-responsive neurons was greater in the STN compared to the GPi. In the STN, reward-related stimuli mobilized a greater proportion of neurons than loss-related stimuli. We also found surprising limbic overlap with the sensorimotor regions in both the STN and GPi, and this overlap was greater than has been previously reported. These findings may help to explain alterations in limbic function that have been observed following deep brain stimulation therapy of the STN and GPi.

768,"There is substantial variability in speech recognition ability across patients with cochlear implants (CIs), auditory brainstem implants (ABIs), and auditory midbrain implants (AMIs). To better understand how this variability is related to central processing differences, the current electroencephalography (EEG) study compared hearing abilities and auditory-cortex activation in patients with electrical stimulation at different sites of the auditory pathway. Three different groups of patients with auditory implants (Hannover Medical School; ABI: n = 6, CI: n = 6; AMI: n = 2) performed a speeded response task and a speech recognition test with auditory, visual, and audio-visual stimuli. Behavioral performance and cortical processing of auditory and audio-visual stimuli were compared between groups. ABI and AMI patients showed prolonged response times on auditory and audio-visual stimuli compared with NH listeners and CI patients. This was confirmed by prolonged N1 latencies and reduced N1 amplitudes in ABI and AMI patients. However, patients with central auditory implants showed a remarkable gain in performance when visual and auditory input was combined, in both speech and non-speech conditions, which was reflected by a strong visual modulation of auditory-cortex activation in these individuals. In sum, the results suggest that the behavioral improvement for audio-visual conditions in central auditory implant patients is based on enhanced audio-visual interactions in the auditory cortex. Their findings may provide important implications for the optimization of electrical stimulation and rehabilitation strategies in patients with central auditory prostheses.

769,"BACKGROUND
Until now, there has been no comprehensive long-term study in Germany on the development of extremely premature infants up to school age.


METHODS
From October 2004 to September 2008, in the German federal state of Lower Saxony, 437 infants born at a gestational age less than 28 weeks were followed up at the ages of 2 and 5 years, and some at the age of 10 years. The 5-year follow-up data were collated with the peri- and neonatological parameters and compared with the 2- and 10-year follow-up data.


RESULTS
The mortality of extremely premature infants was 25.1%. Among the five-year-olds studied, 14.1% showed cognitive impairment and 17.4% had cerebral palsy. 40.4% manifested abnormalities of speech or language, 33.1% had behavioral abnormalities, and 72.5% received therapeutic interventions. Infants in whom severe brain damage was diagnosed by ultrasonography shortly after birth were more likely to develop cerebral palsy (odds ratio [OR] 38.28, 99% confidence interval [12.55; 116.80]) and to have impaired cognitive development (OR 7.36 [2.52; 21.51]). The likelihood of cognitive impairment was also higher among infants whose mothers had a lower level of education (OR 3.83 [1.68; 8.77]). 73.1% (242 out of 331) of the two-year-olds were in the same category of cognitive function at the 5-year follow-up; 82.4% (65 out of 79) of the 5-year-olds were in the same category of cognitive function at the 10-year follow-up.


CONCLUSION
Many of these extremely premature infants had developmental disturbances, and many required therapeutic interventions. The risk factors revealed by this study may help identify patients who are in particular need of support, enabling targeted measures to be taken at the earliest possible stage in order to improve their cognitive and motor abilities. Nationwide, standardized follow-up at the age of 5 years would be desirable.",28130919,2016,The Development of Extremely Premature Infants.
770,"BACKGROUND
Genetic influences on self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs merit investigation. For example, patients frequently use OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat inflammation, but the inflammatory response is also affected by endogenous cytokines whose production varies across polymorphisms of their encoding genes. In the case of interleukin 10 (IL-10), literature suggests that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the cytokine's gene (-1082 A > G [rs1800896]) influences production with higher levels associated with G variant alleles.


OBJECTIVE
To demonstrate the feasibility of researching the role of genetics in self-medication by using existing national survey data to evaluate a possible association between OTC NSAID use and genotype at the -1082 SNP of the IL-10 gene.


METHODS
Statistical analyses were performed using data from 6,309 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).


RESULTS
OTC NSAID use (aspirin or ibuprofen) in the previous month was significantly more common among persons with AG or GG genotypes at the -1082 SNP. Odds of use consistently increased relative to the number of G alleles. This trend remained statistically significant (odds ratio = 1.14 per additional G allele, p = .02, 95% confidence interval [1.02, 1.27]) after adjustment for confounding.


CONCLUSIONS
Analysis of population-based genetic data suggests an association between a common self-medication behavior and a specific genetic polymorphism. These findings broadly demonstrate that NHANES data provide opportunities to investigate such associations and specifically imply that potential interrelationships among OTC NSAID use, IL-10 genotype, and IL-10 cytokine levels deserve further study.",28135825,2017,IL-10 Gene Polymorphisms and Self-Medication With Over-the-Counter Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.

772,"Actinyl-tricarbonato anions [(AnO2)(CO3)3]4- (An = U-Cm) in various environments were investigated using theoretical approaches of quantum-mechanics, molecular-mechanics and cluster-models. Cations and solvent molecules in the 2nd coordination sphere affect the equatorial An←Oeq bonds more than the axial An[triple bond, length as m-dash]Oax bonds. Common actinide contraction is found for calculated and experimental axial bond lengths of 92U to 94Pu, though no longer for 94Pu to 96Cm. The tendency of U to Pu forming actinyl(vi) species dwindles away toward Cm, which already features the preferred AnIII/LnIII oxidation state of the later actinides and all lanthanides. The well known change from d-type to typical U-Pu-Cm type and then to f-type behavior is labeled as the plutonium turn, a phenomenon that is caused by f-orbital energy-decrease and f-orbital localization with increase of both nuclear charge and oxidation state, and a non-linear variation of effective f-electron population across the actinide series. Both orbital and configuration mixing and occupation of antibonding 5f type orbitals increase, weakening the AnOax bonds and reducing the highest possible oxidation states of the later actinides.",28154870,2017,Bonding trends across the series of tricarbonato-actinyl anions [(AnO2)(CO3)3]4- (An = U-Cm): the plutonium turn.
773,"Organisms are believed to have evolved circadian clocks as adaptations to deal with cyclic environmental changes, and therefore it has been hypothesized that evolution in constant environments would lead to regression of such clocks. However, previous studies have yielded mixed results, and evolution of circadian clocks under constant conditions has remained an unsettled topic of debate in circadian biology. In continuation of our previous studies, which reported persistence of circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster populations evolving under constant light, here we intended to examine whether circadian clocks and the associated properties evolve differently under constant light and constant darkness. In this regard, we assayed activity-rest, adult emergence and oviposition rhythms of D. melanogaster populations which have been maintained for over 19 years (~330 generations) under three different light regimes - constant light (LL), light-dark cycles of 12:12 h (LD) and constant darkness (DD). We observed that while circadian rhythms in all the three behaviors persist in both LL and DD stocks with no differences in circadian period, they differed in certain aspects of the entrained rhythms when compared to controls reared in rhythmic environment (LD). Interestingly, we also observed that DD stocks have evolved significantly higher robustness or power of free-running activity-rest and adult emergence rhythms compared to LL stocks. Thus, our study, in addition to corroborating previous results of circadian clock evolution in constant light, also highlights that, contrary to the expected regression of circadian clocks, rearing in constant darkness leads to the evolution of more robust circadian clocks which may be attributed to an intrinsic adaptive advantage of circadian clocks and/or pleiotropic functions of clock genes in other traits.",28156168,2017,Evolution of circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster populations reared in constant light and dark regimes for over 330 generations.
774,"Understanding which verb argument structure (VAS) features (if any) are part of verbs' lexical entries and under which conditions they are accessed provides information on the nature of lexical representations and sentence construction. We investigated neural and behavioral effects of three understudied VAS characteristics (number of subcategorization options, number of thematic options and overall number of valency frames) in lexical decision and sentence well-formedness judgment in healthy adults. VAS effects showed strong dependency on processing conditions. As reflected by behavioral performance and neural recruitment patterns, increased VAS complexity in terms of subcategorization options and thematic options had a detrimental effect on sentence processing, but facilitated lexical access to single words, possibly by providing more lexico-semantic associations and access routes (facilitation through complexity). Effects of the number of valency frames are equivocal. We suggest that VAS effects may be mediated semantically rather than by a dedicated VAS module in verbs' representations.",28160740,2017,Task-dependent neural and behavioral effects of verb argument structure features.

We aimed to identify the factors associated with physical activity for people with MS, with an emphasis on factors that have not been studied previously (bladder and hand dysfunction) and are potentially modifiable. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected in the spring of 2012 during the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry. NARCOMS participants were surveyed regarding smoking using questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey; disability using the Patient Determined Disease Steps; fatigue, cognition, spasticity, sensory, bladder, vision and hand function using self-reported Performance Scales; health literacy using the Medical Term Recognition Test; and physical activity using questions from the Health Information National Trends Survey. We used a forward binary logistic regression to develop a predictive model in which physical activity was the outcome variable. Of 8,755 respondents, 1,707 (19.5%) were classified as active and 7,068 (80.5%) as inactive. In logistic regression, being a current smoker, moderate or severe level of disability, depression, fatigue, hand, or bladder dysfunction and minimal to mild spasticity were associated with lower odds of meeting physical activity guidelines. MS type was not linked to activity level. Several modifiable clinical and lifestyle factors influenced physical activity in MS.

777,"Sleep is involved in the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation and brain plasticity. Consolidation refers to a process through which labile memories are reorganized into more stable ones. An intriguing but often neglected question concerns how pre-existing knowledge is modified when new information enters memory, and whether sleep can influence this process. We investigated how nonword learning may modify the neural representations of closely-related existing words. We also tested whether sleep contributes to any such effect by comparing a group of participants who slept during the night following a first encoding session to a sleep deprived group. Thirty participants were first intensively trained at writing nonwords on Day 1 (remote nonwords) and Day 4 (recent nonwords), following which they underwent functional MRI. This session consisted of a word lexical decision task including words orthographically-close to the trained nonwords, followed by an incidental memory task on the nonwords. Participants who slept detected real words related to remote nonwords faster than those related to recent nonwords, and showed better explicit memory for the remote nonwords. Although the full interaction comparing both groups for these effects was not significant, we found that participants from the sleep-deprivation group did not display such differences between remote and recent conditions. Imaging results revealed that the functional interplay between hippocampus and frontal regions critically mediated these behavioral effects. This study demonstrates that sleep may not only strengthen memory for recently learned items but also promotes a constant reorganization of existing networks of word representations, allowing facilitated access to orthographically-close words.",28173964,2017,Sleep deprivation disrupts the contribution of the hippocampus to the formation of novel lexical associations.

Structural characterization revealed very different local geometries around copper(ii) ions, being square pyramidal for mononuclear complexes (τ5 = 0.021 for 1 and τ5 = 0.13 for 2) and square planar for homobinuclear pyrazine bridged complex 3 (τ4 = 0.06). In complex 3, stacking of chelate rings was observed. This insight was thought to provide new structural evidence for the stacking of the planar chelate rings. These π-interactions provide stability to the crystal structure of homobinuclear complex 3. Magnetic measurements of bulk materials 1, 2 and 3 revealed weak antiferromagnetic coupling in all complexes.

780,"Six-coordinate, rigorously octahedral d4 Mn(III) spin crossover (SCO) complexes are limited by symmetry to an S = 1 (intermediate spin, IS) to S = 2 (high spin, HS) transition. In order to realize the potential S = 0 to S = 2 transition, a lower symmetry and/or change in coordination number is needed, which we explore here computationally. First, a number of complexes are analyzed to develop a reliable and relatively fast DFT protocol for reproducing known Mn(III) spin state energetics. The hybrid meta-GGA functional TPSSh with a modest split valence plus polarization basis set and an empirical dispersion correction is found to predict correctly the ground spin state of Mn(III) complexes, including true low-spin (LS) S = 0 systems, with a range of donor sets including the hexadentate [N4O2] Schiff base ligands. The electronic structure design criteria necessary for realizing a ΔS = 2 SCO transition are described, and a number of model complexes are screened for potential SCO behavior. Five-coordinate trigonal-bipyramidal symmetry fails to yield any suitable systems. Seven-coordinate, approximately pentagonal bipyramidal symmetry is more favorable, and when a known pentadentate macrocyclic donor is combined with π-acceptor axial ligands, a novel Mn(III) complex, [Mn(PABODP)(PF3)2]3+ (PABODP = 2,13-dimethyl-3,6,9,12,18-pentaazabicyclo[12.3.1]octadeca-1(18),2,12,14,16-pentaene), is predicted to have the right spin state energetics for an S = 0 to S = 2 transition. Successful synthesis of such a complex could provide the first example of a ΔS = 2 SCO transition for d4 Mn(III). However, the combination of a rigid macrocycle and a high coordination number dilutes the stereochemical activity of the d electrons, leading to relatively small structural changes between HS and LS systems. It may therefore remain a challenge to realize strong cooperative effects in Mn(III) systems.",28186416,2017,DFT Analysis of Spin Crossover in Mn(III) Complexes: Is a Two-Electron S = 2 to S = 0 Spin Transition Feasible?

The presence of the κ1-bonded metal triazole causes a significant influence on the electronic properties, structure, and reactivity of this new class of Fischer alkoxycarbenes. For the Ru(II) derivatives, their chemical behavior is considerably influenced by the interaction of the (η5-C5H5)(dppe)RuII-triazole moiety with the empty p-carbene orbital that provokes a noticeable decrease in the electrophilicity of the M═C carbon (manifested by the shielding of the 13C NMR chemical shifts). In turn, in the Co(II) derivatives, the incorporation of the (Me4cyclam)CoII moiety diminishes the aromaticity of the triazole ring and has a marked effect on the energy and distribution of the LUSO orbital, mostly resident on the Co(II) fragment. The almost negligible participation of the carbene moiety in the LUSO makes this position unable to react with nucleophiles.

782,"Two experiments with rats examined relapse of an operant behavior that occurred after the behavior was suppressed by reinforcing (incentivizing) an alternative behavior. In the first phase, a target response (R1) was reinforced. In a treatment phase, R1 was still reinforced, but a new response (R2) was introduced and associated with a larger reinforcer. As in human contingency management treatments, incentivizing R2 this way was effective at suppressing R1. However, when R2's reinforcement was discontinued, there was a robust and immediate relapse to R1. Experiment 1 found that the strength of R1 during relapse testing was not different from that seen in a no treatment control. Experiment 2 found that relapse could nevertheless be reduced by presenting reinforcers not contingent on responding during the test. Either the reinforcer for R1 or the reinforcer for R2 (which were qualitatively different types of food pellets) were effective. The experiments introduce a laboratory method for studying relapse and how to prevent it after contingency management treatments, and suggest at least one treatment that discourages relapse.

784,"To understand interfacial behavior of actinides adsorbed onto mineral surfaces and unravel their structure-property relationship, the structures, electronic properties, and energetics of various ligated uranyl species adsorbed onto TiO2 surface nanoparticle clusters (SNCs) were examined using relativistic density functional theory. Rutile (110) and anatase (101) titania surfaces, experimentally known to be stable, were fully optimized. For the former, models studied include clean and water-free Ti27O64H20 (dry), partially hydrated (Ti27O64H20)(H2O)8 (sol) and proton-saturated [(Ti27O64H20)(H2O)8(H)2]2+ (sat), while defect-free and defected anatase SNCs involving more than 38 TiO2 units were considered. The aquouranyl sorption onto rutile SNCs is energetically preferred, with interaction energies of -8.54, -10.36, and -2.39 eV, respectively. Energy decomposition demonstrates that the sorption is dominated by orbital attractive interactions and modified by steric effects. Greater hydrogen-bonding involvement leads to increased orbital interactions (i.e., more negative energy) from dry to sol/sat complexes, while much larger steric interaction in the sat complex significantly reduces the sorption interaction (i.e., more positive energy). For dry SNC, adsorbates were varied from aquo to aquo-carbonato, to carbonato, to hydroxo uranyl species. Longer U-Osurf/U-Ti distances and more positive sorption energies were calculated upon introducing carbonato and hydroxo ligands, indicative of weaker uranyl sorption onto the substrate. This is consistent with experimental observations that the uranyl sorption rate decreases upon raising solution pH value or adding carbon dioxide. Anatase SNCs adsorbing aquouranyl are even more exothermic, because more bonds are formed than in the case of rutile. Moreover, the anatase sorption can be tuned by surface defects as well as its Ti and O stoichiometry. All the aquouranyl-SNC complexes show similar character of molecular orbitals and energetic order although differing in highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps and orbital energy levels, but changes can be accomplished by adding carbonato and hydroxo ligands.",28195715,2017,Interfacial Interaction of Titania Nanoparticles and Ligated Uranyl Species: A Relativistic DFT Investigation.
785,"BACKGROUND
Preliminary studies show psychedelic compounds administered with psychotherapy are potentially effective and durable substance misuse interventions. However, little is known about the association between psychedelic use and substance misuse in the general population. This study investigated the association between psychedelic use and past year opioid use disorders within illicit opioid users.


METHODS
While controlling for socio-demographic covariates and the use of other substances, the relationship between classic psychedelic use and past year opioid use disorders was analyzed within 44,000 illicit opioid users who completed the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 to 2013.


RESULTS
Among respondents with a history of illicit opioid use, psychedelic drug use is associated with 27% reduced risk of past year opioid dependence (weighted risk ratio = 0.73 (0.60-0.89) p = 0.002) and 40% reduced risk of past year opioid abuse (weighted risk ratio = 0.60 (0.41-0.86) p = 0.006). Other than marijuana use, which was associated with 55% reduced risk of past year opioid abuse (weighted risk ratio = 0.45 (0.30-0.66) p < 0.001), no other illicit drug was associated with reduced risk of past year opioid dependence or abuse.


CONCLUSION
Experience with psychedelic drugs is associated with decreased risk of opioid abuse and dependence. Conversely, other illicit drug use history is largely associated with increased risk of opioid abuse and dependence.

Fast-track (FT) postoperative protocol in oncological patients after major abdominal surgery reduces complications and length of postoperative stay compared to the conventional (CON) protocol. However, stress and pain responses have not been compared between the two protocols.


OBJECTIVES
To compare stress, pain, and related neuropeptidic responses (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], cortisol, and neuropeptide Y [NPY]) between FT and CON protocols.


METHOD
A clinical trial with repeated measurements was conducted (May 2012 to May 2014) with a sample of 63 hepatectomized or pancreatectomized patients randomized into two groups: FT ( n = 29) or CON ( n = 34). Demographic and clinical data were collected, and pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and Behavioral Pain Scale [BPS]) and stress responses (3 self-report questions) assessed.

Participants were pre- (ages 8-9) and post-pubertal (ages 15-17) children who visited the laboratory three times and consumed a beverage containing 0, 1, or 2 mg/kg of caffeine. Thirty minutes later, participants completed the balloon analogue risk task (BART), the Iowa gambling task (IGT), and a delay discounting task. The number of balloons exploded on the BART task was significantly increased after 2 mg/kg of caffeine in moderate caffeine consumers, but was decreased after 2 mg/kg of caffeine in high caffeine consumers. There were no main effects of caffeine dose on the delay discounting task or on the IGT. Post-pubertal participants showed reduced delay discounting compared with pre-pubertal participants. Finally, average daily caffeine use was significantly, positively correlated with scores on a risk-taking questionnaire. These data suggest that caffeine dose-dependently influences decision making and risk taking. More research is needed to determine the mechanism of this difference as well as the extent to which sex and pubertal phase influence these relationships.",28198658,2017,Effects of acute and chronic caffeine on risk-taking behavior in children and adolescents.
788,"The noncentrosymmetric tungstate oxide, Ce18W10O57, was synthesized for the first time as high-quality single crystals via the molten chloride flux method and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound is a structural analogue to the previously reported La18W10O57, which crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P6̅2c. The +3 oxidation state of cerium in Ce18W10O57 was achieved via the in situ reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III) using Zn metal. The structure consists of both isolated and face-shared WO6 octahedra and, surprisingly, isolated WO6 trigonal prisms. A careful analysis of the packing arrangement in the structure makes it possible to explain the unusual structural architecture of Ce18W10O57, which is described in detail. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of Ce18W10O57 indicates that the cerium(III) f1 cations do not order magnetically and exhibit simple paramagnetic behavior. The SHG efficiency of Ln18W10O57 (Ln = La, Ce) was measured as a function of particle size, and both compounds were found to be SHG active with efficiency approximately equal to that of α-SiO2.",28199086,2017,Crystal Growth and Structure Analysis of Ce18W10O57: A Complex Oxide Containing Tungsten in an Unusual Trigonal Prismatic Coordination Environment.
789,"First-principles calculations have been carried out to study the InVO4 compound under pressure. In this work, total energy calculations were performed in order to analyze the structural behavior of the experimentally known polymorphs of InVO4: α-MnMoO4-type (I), CrVO4-type (III), and wolframite (V). In addition, in this paper we present our results about the stability of this compound beyond the pressures reached by experiments. We propose some new high-pressure phases on the basis of the study of 13 possible candidates. The quasi-harmonic approximation has been used to calculate the sequence of phase transitions at 300 K: CrVO4-type, III (the transition pressure is given in parentheses) → wolframite, V (4.4 GPa) → raspite, VI (28.1 GPa) → AgMnO4-type, VII (44 GPa). Equations of state and phonon frequencies as a function of pressure have been calculated for the studied phases. In order to determine the stability of each phase, we also report the phonon dispersion along the Brillouin zone and the phonon density of states for the most stable polymorphs. Finally, the electronic band structure for the low- and high-pressure phases for the studied polymorphs is presented as well as the pressure evolution of the band gap by using the HSE06 hybrid functional.",28199093,2017,First-Principles Study of InVO4 under Pressure: Phase Transitions from CrVO4- to AgMnO4-Type Structure.
790,"Gas storage/separation is a typical application of porous materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The adsorption/separation behavior results from the host-guest and/or guest-guest interaction and equilibration (host, porous material; guest, adsorbates). Although the driving forces for gas adsorption have been investigated, a detailed picture of interactions between gas molecules and MOFs has not clearly emerged. Herein, a new cobalt microporous MOF [Co(tipb)(adc)](DMF)3(H2O)1.5, which possesses a rare self-interpenetrated gra topology, has been prepared with both tipb and H2adc ligands (tipb = 1,3,5-tris(p-imidazolylphenyl)benzene, adc = 9,10-anthracenedicarboxylate). This MOF shows high stability and exceptional selective adsorption of CO2 over N2, O2, and CH4. In particular, a theoretical assumption of a ""regional dynamic electric field effect"" is proposed to clarify the selective adsorption. Moreover, we suggest that the proposed effect may be one of the most important factors impacting gas separation and storage in porous materials.",28199096,2017,Why Porous Materials Have Selective Adsorptions: A Rational Aspect from Electrodynamics.
791,"OBJECTIVE
To report the clinical features, comorbidities, receptor subunit targets, and outcome in patients with anti-GABAA receptor (GABAAR) encephalitis.


METHODS
Clinical study of 26 patients, including 17 new (April 2013-January 2016) and 9 previously reported patients. Antibodies to α1, β3, and γ2 subunits of the GABAAR were determined using reported techniques.


RESULTS
Patients' median age was 40.5 years (interquartile range 48.5 [13.75-62.35] years; the youngest 2.5 months old; 13 female). Symptoms included seizures (88%), alteration of cognition (67%), behavior (46%), consciousness (42%), or abnormal movements (35%). Comorbidities were identified in 11 (42%) patients, including 7 tumors (mostly thymomas), 2 herpesvirus encephalitis (herpes simplex virus 1, human herpesvirus 6; coexisting with NMDAR antibodies), and 2 myasthenia without thymoma. Brain MRI was abnormal in 23 (88%) patients, showing in 20 (77%) multifocal, asynchronous, cortical-subcortical T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery abnormalities predominantly involving temporal (95%) and frontal (65%) lobes, but also basal ganglia and other regions. Immunologic or tumor therapy resulted in substantial improvement in 18/21 (86%) assessable patients; the other 3 (14%) died (2 status epilepticus, 1 sepsis). Compared with adults, children were more likely to have generalized seizures (p = 0.007) and movement disorders (p = 0.01) and less likely to have a tumor (p = 0.01). The main epitope targets were in the α1/β3 subunits of the GABAAR.


CONCLUSIONS
Anti-GABAAR encephalitis is characterized by frequent seizures and distinctive multifocal cortical-subcortical MRI abnormalities that provide an important clue to the diagnosis. The frequency of symptoms and comorbidities differ between children (more viral-related) and adults (more tumor-related). The disorder is severe but most patients respond to treatment.",28202703,2017,Investigations in GABAA receptor antibody-associated encephalitis.
792,"Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) behavior is rare but important for both fundamental studies and practical applications of functional materials. Until now, most available ZTE materials are either electrical insulating oxides or conductive metallic compounds. Very few ZTE materials exhibit the semiconductor feature. Here we report a ZTE in a semiconducting ferroelectric of 0.6PbTiO3-0.4Bi(Co0.55Ti0.45)O3-δ. Its unit cell volume exhibits a negligible change over a broad temperature range from room temperature to 500 °C. The ZTE is supposed to be correlated with the spontaneous volume ferroelectronstriction. Intriguingly, the present ZTE material also exhibits the semiconducting characteristic accompanied by negative temperature coefficient of resistance. The mechanism of electric conduction is attributed to the electronic hopping from one ion (Ti3+) to another (Ti4+). The semiconductor nature has also been confirmed by the noticeable visible-light absorption with the relatively lower band gap (Eg) value of 1.5 eV, while the ferroelectric property can be well-maintained with large polarization. The first-principles calculations reveal that the drastically narrowed Eg is related to the Co-Ti substitution. The present multifunctional material containing ZTE, semiconducting, and ferroelectric properties is suggested to enable new applications such as the substrate for solar conversion devices.",28207241,2017,"Zero Thermal Expansion and Semiconducting Properties in PbTiO3-Bi(Co, Ti)O3 Ferroelectric Solid Solutions."
793,"The synthesis and magnetic and theoretical studies of three isostructural heterometallic [CoIII2LnIII2(μ3-OH)2(o-tol)4(mdea)2(NO3)2] (Ln = Dy (1), Tb (2), Ho (3)) ""butterfly"" complexes are reported (o-tol = o-toluate, (mdea)2- = doubly deprotonated N-methyldiethanolamine). The CoIII ions are diamagnetic in these complexes. Analysis of the dc magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the two LnIII ions for all three complexes. ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior for complex 1, in the absence of an external magnetic field, with an anisotropy barrier Ueff of 81.2 cm-1, while complexes 2 and 3 exhibit field induced SMM behavior, with a Ueff value of 34.2 cm-1 for 2. The barrier height for 3 could not be quantified. To understand the experimental observations, we performed DFT and ab initio CASSCF+RASSI-SO calculations to probe the single-ion properties and the nature and magnitude of the LnIII-LnIII magnetic coupling and to develop an understanding of the role the diamagnetic CoIII ion plays in the magnetization relaxation. The calculations were able to rationalize the experimental relaxation data for all complexes and strongly suggest that the CoIII ion is integral to the observation of SMM behavior in these systems. Thus, we explored further the effect that the diamagnetic CoIII ions have on the magnetization blocking of 1. We did this by modeling a dinuclear {DyIII2} complex (1a), with the removal of the diamagnetic ions, and three complexes of the types {KI2DyIII2} (1b), {ZnII2DyIII2} (1c), and {TiIV2DyIII2} (1d), each containing a different diamagnetic ion. We found that the presence of the diamagnetic ions results in larger negative charges on the bridging hydroxides (1b > 1c > 1 > 1d), in comparison to 1a (no diamagnetic ion), which reduces quantum tunneling of magnetization effects, allowing for more desirable SMM characteristics. The results indicate very strong dependence of diamagnetic ions in the magnetization blocking and the magnitude of the energy barriers. Here we propose a synthetic strategy to enhance the energy barrier in lanthanide-based SMMs by incorporating s- and d-block diamagnetic ions. The presented strategy is likely to have implications beyond the single-molecule magnets studied here.",28211682,2017,"Exploring the Influence of Diamagnetic Ions on the Mechanism of Magnetization Relaxation in {CoIII2LnIII2} (Ln = Dy, Tb, Ho) ""Butterfly"" Complexes."
794,"Next-generation sequencing technologies have afforded unprecedented characterization of low-frequency and rare genetic variation. Due to low power for single-variant testing, aggregative methods are commonly used to combine observed rare variation within a single gene. Causal variation may also aggregate across multiple genes within relevant biomolecular pathways. Kernel-machine regression and adaptive testing methods for aggregative rare-variant association testing have been demonstrated to be powerful approaches for pathway-level analysis, although these methods tend to be computationally intensive at high-variant dimensionality and require access to complete data. An additional analytical issue in scans of large pathway definition sets is multiple testing correction. Gene set definitions may exhibit substantial genic overlap, and the impact of the resultant correlation in test statistics on Type I error rate control for large agnostic gene set scans has not been fully explored. Herein, we first outline a statistical strategy for aggregative rare-variant analysis using component gene-level linear kernel score test summary statistics as well as derive simple estimators of the effective number of tests for family-wise error rate control. We then conduct extensive simulation studies to characterize the behavior of our approach relative to direct application of kernel and adaptive methods under a variety of conditions. We also apply our method to two case-control studies, respectively, evaluating rare variation in hereditary prostate cancer and schizophrenia. Finally, we provide open-source R code for public use to facilitate easy application of our methods to existing rare-variant analysis results.",28211093,2017,gsSKAT: Rapid gene set analysis and multiple testing correction for rare-variant association studies using weighted linear kernels.
795,"The complexation of U(VI) with octylphenyl-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO, denoted as L) in ionic liquid (IL) C4mimNTf2 was investigated by UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Spectro-photometric titration suggests that three successive complexes, UO2Lj2+ (j = 1-3), formed both in ""dry"" (water content < 250 ppm) and ""wet"" (water content ≈ 12 500 ppm) ionic liquid. However, the thermodynamic parameters are distinctly different in the two ILs. In dry IL, the complexation strength between CMPO and U(VI) is much stronger, with stability constants of the respective complexes more than 1 order of magnitude higher than that in wet IL. Energetically, the complexation of U(VI) with CMPO in dry IL is mainly driven by negative enthalpies. In contrast, the complexation in wet IL is overwhelmingly driven by highly positive entropies as a result of the release of a large amount of water molecules from the solvation sphere of U(VI). Moreover, comparisons between the fitted absorption spectra of complexes in wet IL and that of extractive samples from solvent extraction have identified the speciation involved in the extraction of U(VI) by CMPO in ionic liquid. The results from this study not only offer a thermodynamic insight into the complexation behavior of U(VI) with CMPO in IL but also provide valuable information for understanding the extraction behavior in the corresponding solvent extraction system.",28212016,2017,Thermodynamic Insight into the Solvation and Complexation Behavior of U(VI) in Ionic Liquid: Binding of CMPO with U(VI) Studied by Optical Spectroscopy and Calorimetry.
796,"We synthesized two new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) {Ln7(OH)5[Ru(dcbpy)3]4·4nH2O} (Ln7-Ru4; Ln = Ce, Nd) composed of the luminescent ruthenium(II) metalloligand [Ru(4,4'-dcbpy)3]4- ([4Ru]; 4,4'-dcbpy = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine) and lanthanide ions Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Nd). These two PCPs Ln7-Ru4 are isomorphous with the previously reported PCP La7-Ru4, and the lattice constants (a, c, and unit cell volume V) changed systematically according to the lanthanide contraction. All three Ln7-Ru4 compounds have OH- anion containing porous structures and a large number of hydrate water molecules within the pores, resulting in moderate ion conductivities (10-6-10-7 S cm-1) at 90% relative humidity (RH) and 298 K. In contrast, the structural transformation of Ln7-Ru4 associated with water-vapor adsorption/desorption strongly depends on the lanthanide ion; the Ln7-Ru4 compounds with larger Ln3+ ions recover the original porous structure at lower relative humidities (RH). A similar trend was observed for the ion conduction activation energy, suggesting that the bridging Ln3+ ion plays an important role in the formation of the ion-conductive pathways. La7-Ru4 and Ce7-Ru4 exhibit vapochromic luminescence associated with water vapor adsorption/desorption, arising from the 3MLCT emission of [4Ru]. This vapochromic behavior is also affected by the replacement of the Ln3+ ion; the vapochromic shift of Ce7-Ru4 was observed at RH values (near 100% RH) higher than that of La7-Ru4. 3MLCT emissions of the [4Ru] metalloligand in Nd7-Ru4 were barely observable in the visible region, but sharp emission bands characteristic of 4f-4f transitions of the Nd3+ ion were observed in the near-infrared (NIR) region (arising from the 1MLCT transition of [4Ru]), suggesting the transfer of energy from the [4Ru] 3MLCT excited state to the 4f-4f transition state of the Nd3+ ions.",28212036,2017,Development of Ion-Conductive and Vapoluminescent Porous Coordination Polymers Composed of Ruthenium(II) Metalloligand.
797,"INTRODUCTION
Populations of deaf sign language users experience health disparities unmeasured by current public health surveillance. Population-specific health data are necessary to collaboratively identify health priorities and evaluate interventions. Standardized, reproducible, and language-concordant data collection in sign language is impossible via written or telephone surveys.


METHODS
Deaf and hearing researchers, community members, and other stakeholders developed a broad computer-based health survey based on the telephone-administered Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. They translated survey items from English to sign language, evaluated the translations, and filmed the survey items for inclusion in their custom software. They initiated the second Rochester Deaf Health Survey in 2013 (n=211). Analyses (conducted in 2015) compared Rochester Deaf Health Survey 2013 findings with those of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System with the general adult population in the same community (2012, n=1,816).


RESULTS
The Rochester Deaf Health Survey 2013 participants' mean age was 44.7 (range, 18-87) years. Most were deaf since birth or early childhood (87.1%) and highly educated (53.6% with ≥4 years of college). The median household income was <$35,000. The prevalence of current smokers was low (8.1%). Nearly all (93.8%) reported having health insurance, yet barriers to appropriate health care were evident, with high emergency department use (16.2% with two or more past-year visits) and 22.7% forgoing needed health care in the past year because of cost.

798,"African-American males ages 13 through 24 are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), accounting for over half of all HIV infections in this age group in the United States. Clear communication between African-American parents and their youth about sexual health is associated with higher rates of sexual abstinence, condom use, and intent to delay initiation of sexual intercourse. However, little is known about African-American fathers' perceptions of what facilitates and inhibits sexual health communication with their preadolescent and adolescent sons. We conducted focus groups with 29 African-American fathers of sons ages 10-15 to explore perceived facilitators and barriers for father-son communication about sexual health. Participants were recruited from barbershops in metropolitan and rural North Carolina communities highly affected by STIs and HIV, and data were analyzed using content analysis. Three factors facilitated father-son communication: (a) fathers' acceptance of their roles and responsibilities; (b) a positive father-son relationship; and (c) fathers' ability to speak directly to their sons about sex. We also identified three barriers: (a) fathers' difficulty in initiating sexual health discussions with their sons; (b) sons' developmental readiness for sexual health information; and (c) fathers' lack of experience in talking with their own fathers about sex. These findings have implications for father-focused prevention interventions aimed at reducing risky sexual behaviors in adolescent African-American males. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",28220553,2017,African-American Fathers' Perspectives on Facilitators and Barriers to Father-Son Sexual Health Communication.

The role of vacancy defects in thermal buckling response of precompressed CNTs is explored via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Defective CNTs are initially compressed at a certain ratio of their critical buckling strain and then undergo a uniform temperature rise. Comprehensive study is implemented on both armchair and zigzag CNTs with different vacancy defects including monovacancy, symmetric bivacancy and asymmetric bivacancy. The results reveal that defects have a pronounced impact on the buckling behavior of CNTs; interestingly, defective CNTs under compressive pre-load show higher resistance to thermal buckling than pristine ones.

The choice of starting materials, their mixing ratios, and the hydrothermal reaction temperature was crucial for obtaining products with superior superconducting properties. The structure of the powder sample was investigated using laboratory X-ray diffraction, high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) data, and electron diffraction (ED) patterns [transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis]. The refinement of SXRD data confirmed a simple perovskite-type structure with a cubic cell of a = 4.27864(2) Å [space group Pm3̅m (No. 221)].

803,"A molecular modeling study has been carried out on a previously reported series of (diselanediyldibenzene-4,1-diylnide)biscarbamate derivatives that show cytotoxic and antiproliferative in vitro activity against MCF-7 human cell line; radical scavenging properties were also confirmed when these compounds were tested for their ability to scavenge DPPH and ABTS radicals. The data obtained allowed us to classify the compounds into two different groups: (a) aliphatic carbamates for which the activity could be related with a first nucleophilic attack (mediated by H2O, for example) on the selenium atoms of the central scaffold, followed by the release of the alkyl N-(4-selanylphenyl) and N-(4-selenenophenyl)carbamate moieties. Then, a second nucleophilic attack on the carbamate moiety, to yield 4-aminobenzeneselenol and 4-selenenoaniline respectively, which can ultimately be responsible for the activity of the compounds; (b) aromatic carbamates, for which we propose a preferred nucleophilic attack on the carbamate moiety, yielding 4-[(4-aminophenyl)diselanyl]aniline, the common structural fragment for this series, for which we have previously demonstrated its cytotoxic profile. Then, selenium atoms of the central fragment may later undergo a new nucleophilic attack, to yield 4-selenenoaniline and 4-aminobenzeneselenol. The phenolic moieties released in this process may also have a synergistic cytotoxic and redox activity. The data that support this connection include the conformational behavior and the molecular topography of the derivatives which can influence the accessibility of the hydrolysis points, and some quantum descriptors (bond order, atomic charges, total valences, ionization potential, electron affinity, HOMO 0 and LUMO 0 location, etc.) that have been related to the biological activity of the compounds.",28236745,2017,"Topological and quantum molecular descriptors as effective tools for analyzing cytotoxic activity achieved by a series of (diselanediyldibenzene-4,1-diylnide)biscarbamate derivatives."
804,"The aromatic methylene blue cation (MB+) shows unprecedented ligand behavior in the X-ray structures of the trigonal-planar (TP) complexes MBMCl2 (M = CuI, AgI). The two isostructural compounds were exclusively synthesized by grinding together methylene blue chloride and MCl solids. Only in the case of AuCl did the technique lead to a different, yet isoformular, AuI derivative with separated MB+ and AuCl2- counterions and no direct N-Au linkage. While the density functional theory (DFT) molecular modeling failed in reproducing the isolated Cu and Ag complexes, the solid-state program CRYSTAL satisfactorily provided for Cu the correct TP building block associated with a highly compact π stacking of the MB+ ligands. In this respect, the dispersion interactions, evaluated with the DFT functional, provide to the system an extra energy, which likely supports the unprecedented metal coordination of the MB+ cation. The feature seems governed by subtle chemical factors, such as, for instance, the selected metal ion of the coinage triad. Thus, the electronically consistent AuI ion does not form the analogous TP building block because of a looser supramolecular arrangement.

This new compound crystallizes in the space group I4/mmm with the interstitial Fe in pristine Fe1+xCuTe2 completely removed after K intercalation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that after intercalation, the valence of Fe switched from a mixture of +2 and +3 to the single trivalent one. The KFeCuTe2 is a Mott semiconductor (Eg = 1.06 eV) with a larger resistivity than that of Fe1+xCuTe2 due to the absence of electron doping from interstitial Fe atoms. Most importantly, the magnetic susceptibility shows the antiferromagnetic transition in KFeCuTe2 at 60 K, instead of the spin-glass behavior in Fe1+xCuTe2, indicating the crucial role of interstitial Fe in breaking the long-range magnetic ordering.

The structure of the LiB3O5-Li2Mo3O10 high-temperature solution is essential to understanding the flux behavior of Li2Mo3O10 but still remains unclear. In this work, high-temperature Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory (DFT) was applied to study the LiB3O5-Li2Mo3O10 solution structure. Raman spectra of a LiB3O5-Li4Mo5O17-Li2Mo4O13 polycrystalline mixture were recorded at different temperatures until the mixture melted completely. The solution structure was deduced from the spectral changes and verified by DFT calculations. When the mixture began to melt, its molybdate component first changed into the Li2Mo3O10 melt; meanwhile, the complicated molybdate groups existing in the crystalline state transformed into Mo3O102- groups, which are formed by three corner-sharing MoO3Ø-/MoO2Ø2 (Ø = bridging oxygen atom) tetrahedra.

Single-crystal X-ray analysis showed that 1 (1a) and 3 consist of a tetranuclear pivalate/teaH3 mixed-ligand cluster [CoII2CoIII2(O2CCMe3)4(teaH)2(N3)]+ decorated with sodium pivalates [Na(O2CCMe3)2(HO2CCMe3)2]- (1 or 1a) or sodium nitrates [Na(NO3)2]- (3) to form a square-pyramidal assembly. In 2, the cationic [Co8(O2CCMe3)10(teaH)4(N3)]+ cluster comprises a mixed-valent {CoII4CoIII4} core encapsulated by an azide, 4 teaH2- alcoholamine ligands, and 10 bridging pivalates. Remarkably, in this core, the μ4-N3- ligand joins all four CoII atoms. The heterometallic hexanuclear compound 4 consists of a cationic [CoIII3DyIII3(OH)4(O2CCMe3)6(teaH)3(H2O)3]2+ cluster, two NO3- anions, and a crystallization water molecule. The arrangement of metal atoms in 4 can be approximated as the assembly of a smaller equilateral triangle defined by three Dy sites with a Dy···Dy distance of 3.9 Å and a larger triangle formed by Co sites [Co···Co, 6.1-6.2 Å]. The interpretation of the magnetic properties of clusters 2-4 was performed in the framework of theoretical models, taking into account the structural peculiarities of clusters and their energy spectra. The behavior of clusters 2 and 3 containing CoII ions with orbitally nondegenerate ground states is determined by the zero-field splitting of these states and Heisenberg exchange interaction between the ions. To get a good understanding of the observed magnetic behavior of cluster 4, we take into consideration the crystal fields acting on the DyIII ions, the ferromagnetic coupling of neighboring DyIII ions, and the intercluster antiferromagnetic exchange. For all examined clusters, the developed models describe well the observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the field dependence of magnetization. The computational results apparently show that in cluster 4 two DyIII ions with similar nearest surroundings demonstrate single-molecule-magnet (SMM) behavior, while the strong rhombicity of the ligand surrounding hinders the SMM behavior of the third DyIII ion.",28260389,2017,"Tetranuclear {CoII2CoIII2}, Octanuclear {CoII4CoIII4}, and Hexanuclear {CoIII3DyIII3} Pivalate Clusters: Synthesis, Magnetic Characterization, and Theoretical Modeling."
809,"The flexibility of σ-conjugated silanes presents new opportunities for manipulating charge generation, transport, and non-linear optical properties of materials. Recently we synthesized a series of acceptor-donor-acceptor (ADA) compounds in which a methylated oligosilane core (D) is flanked by electron-deficient cyanovinyl-substituted arenes (A). Based on a detailed characterization of the photophysics of ADA and donor-acceptor (DA) architectures using both steady state and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements we illustrate that asymmetric charge separation occurs directly following light absorption. Lippert analysis of solvatochromic emission indicates large changes in dipole moments on excitation consistent with the formation of dipolar emissive states. Time resolved absorption measurements reveal common excited-state relaxation behavior across molecular structures: spectral dynamics associated with the relaxation of nascent excited states occur on a common timescale for all structures within the same solvent environment, whereas charge recombination via excited-state decay consistently follows a common energy gap law. Ultrafast time-resolved Raman measurements reveal that reduction of the cyanovinyl moieties is instantaneous with excitation, with only minor shifts in vibrational features over the course of excited-state relaxation. We conclude that excited-state symmetry breaking that gives rise to asymmetric intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is associated with the conformation of the central Si chain. In contrast, ultrafast solvent reorganization or solvent-controlled intramolecular dynamics only serve to stabilize nascent dipolar excited states, rather than induce charge separation from an initial quadrupolar state.",28262895,2017,Asymmetric charge separation and recombination in symmetrically functionalized σ-π hybrid oligosilanes.

812,"OBJECTIVES
We examined the interactions between three dopamine gene alleles (DAT1, DRD2, DRD4) previously associated with violent behavior and two components of the adolescent environment (exposure to violence, school social environment) to predict adulthood physical intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration among white men and women.


METHODS
We used data from Wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a cohort study following individuals from adolescence to adulthood. Based on the prior literature, we categorized participants as at risk for each of the three dopamine genes using this coding scheme: two 10-R alleles for DAT1; at least one A-1 allele for DRD2; at least one 7-R or 8-R allele for DRD4. Adolescent exposure to violence and school social environment was measured in 1994 and 1995 when participants were in high school or middle school. Intimate partner violence perpetration was measured in 2008 when participants were 24 to 32 years old. We used simple and multivariable logistic regression models, including interactions of genes and the adolescent environments for the analysis.


RESULTS
Presence of risk alleles was not independently associated with IPV perpetration but increasing exposure to violence and disconnection from the school social environment was associated with physical IPV perpetration. The effects of these adolescent experiences on physical IPV perpetration varied by dopamine risk allele status. Among individuals with non-risk dopamine alleles, increased exposure to violence during adolescence and perception of disconnection from the school environment were significantly associated with increased odds of physical IPV perpetration, but individuals with high risk alleles, overall, did not experience the same increase.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggested the effects of adolescent environment on adulthood physical IPV perpetration varied by genetic factors. This analysis did not find a direct link between risk alleles and violence, but contributes to growing research indicating that if genetic factors contribute to perpetration, this relationship is likely complicated and the result of interactions with other factors.",28264032,2017,Interactions of adolescent social experiences and dopamine genes to predict physical intimate partner violence perpetration.
813,"AgBiSe2 has recently been shown to exhibit promising thermoelectric properties due to the low intrinsic thermal conductivity, stemming from a large degree of lattice anharmonicity. While samples synthesized via solid-state routes usually exhibit n-type behavior, p-type transport is seen in samples based on solution synthetic routes possibly due to Ag vacancies. Using a combined approach of synchrotron diffraction, thermoelectric transport measurements and thermal transport modeling, we show the influence of synthetically induced Ag vacancies on the structure of AgBiSe2 and the thermoelectric transport. We identify the degree of anti-site disorder of Ag and Bi due to the occurring phase transformation and the influence of the vacancy content on metal ordering. Additionally, we show that anti-site disorder and vacancies act as scattering centers for phonons, leading to enhanced point defect scattering in this interesting thermoelectric material.",28265625,2017,Vacancy and anti-site disorder scattering in AgBiSe2 thermoelectrics.

The deprotonated phenoxido O atoms of the organic chelate occupy the axial triangular faces of the prism and were found to be very close to the main anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions. As a result, the {DyIII2} compound exhibits frequency- and temperature-dependent out-of-phase ac signals below ∼25 K in the absence of a static dc field, yielding an energy barrier of 109.3(1) K for the reversal of magnetization. Fast and efficient quantum tunneling of magnetization, attributed to the strong tails of signals below ∼15 K, was suppressed through the application of a small dc field, yielding entirely visible χM″ signals below 27 K. Single-crystal magnetic hysteresis studies confirmed the single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior of 1; the hysteresis loops appear at temperatures below ∼5 K, which is one of the highest blocking temperatures in the field of 4f-SMMs to date.

The ligand contains two sets of tridentate binding units, each of them giving rise to a coordination set consisting of a pair of 5- and 6-membered chelate rings, connected by an ethanediamide linker. Stereoselectivity effects were studied in the oxidations of a series of chiral l/d biogenic catechols and the pair of l/d-tyrosine methyl esters, in this case as their phenolate salts. The oxidation of β-naphthol has also been studied as a model monooxygenase reaction. The catechol oxidation was investigated in a range of substrate concentrations at slightly acidic pH and exhibited a marked dependence on the concentration of the [Cu2EHI]4+ complex. This behavior has been interpreted in terms of an equilibrium between a monomeric and a dimeric form of the catalyst. Binding studies of l- and d-tyrosine were performed as a support for the interpretation of the stereoselectivity effects observed in the reactions. In general, [Cu2EHI]4+ exhibits a binding preference for the l- rather than the d-enantiomer of the substrates, but it appears that in the catecholase reaction the oxidation of the d-isomer occurs at a faster rate than for the l counterpart. The same type of enantio-discriminating behavior is observed in the oxidation of l-/d-tyrosine methyl esters. In this case the reaction produces a complex mixture of products; the main product consisting of a trimeric compound, likely formed by radical coupling reactions, has been isolated and characterized. The oxidation of β-naphthol yields an additional product of the expected quinone but labeling experiments with 18-O2 show no oxygen incorporation into the product, confirming that the oxidation likely proceeds through a radical mechanism.",28271098,2017,A dinuclear biomimetic Cu complex derived from l-histidine: synthesis and stereoselective oxidations.
817,"BACKGROUND
Unperturbed tumor growth kinetics is one of the more studied cancer topics; however, it is poorly understood. Mathematical modeling is a useful tool to elucidate new mechanisms involved in tumor growth kinetics, which can be relevant to understand cancer genesis and select the most suitable treatment.


METHODS
The classical Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami as well as the modified Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami models to describe unperturbed fibrosarcoma Sa-37 tumor growth are used and compared with the Gompertz modified and Logistic models. Viable tumor cells (1×105) are inoculated to 28 BALB/c male mice.


RESULTS
Modified Gompertz, Logistic, Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami classical and modified Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami models fit well to the experimental data and agree with one another. A jump in the time behaviors of the instantaneous slopes of classical and modified Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami models and high values of these instantaneous slopes at very early stages of tumor growth kinetics are observed.


CONCLUSIONS
The modified Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation can be used to describe unperturbed fibrosarcoma Sa-37 tumor growth. It reveals that diffusion-controlled nucleation/growth and impingement mechanisms are involved in tumor growth kinetics.

818,"OBJECTIVES
The Demand-Control (DC) and Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) models predict health in a work context. Self-report measures of the four key constructs (demand, control, effort, and reward) have been developed and it is important that these measures have good content validity uncontaminated by content from other constructs. We assessed relevance (whether items reflect the constructs) and representativeness (whether all aspects of the construct are assessed, and all items contribute to that assessment) across the instruments and items.


METHODS
Two studies examined fourteen demand/control items from the Job Content Questionnaire and seventeen effort/reward items from the Effort-Reward Imbalance measure using discriminant content validation and a third study developed new methods to assess instrument representativeness. Both methods use judges' ratings and construct definitions to get transparent quantitative estimates of construct validity. Study 1 used dictionary definitions while studies 2 and 3 used published phrases to define constructs.


RESULTS
Overall, 3/5 demand items, 4/9 control items, 1/6 effort items, and 7/11 reward items were uniquely classified to the appropriate theoretical construct and were therefore 'pure' items with discriminant content validity (DCV). All pure items measured a defining phrase. However, both the DC and ERI assessment instruments failed to assess all defining aspects.


CONCLUSIONS
Finding good discriminant content validity for demand and reward measures means these measures are usable and our quantitative results can guide item selection. By contrast, effort and control measures had limitations (in relevance and representativeness) presenting a challenge to the implementation of the theories. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? While the reliability and construct validity of Demand-Control and Effort-Reward-Imbalance (DC and ERI) work stress measures are routinely reported, there has not been adequate investigation of their content validity. This paper investigates their content validity in terms of both relevance and representativeness and provides a model for the investigation of content validity of measures in health psychology more generally. What does this study add? A new application of an existing method, discriminant content validity, and a new method of assessing instrument representativeness. 'Pure' DC and ERI items are identified, as are constructs that are not fully represented by their assessment instruments. The findings are important for studies attempting to distinguish between the main DC and ERI work stress constructs. The quantitative results can be used to guide item selection for future studies.",28271592,2017,What do Demand-Control and Effort-Reward work stress questionnaires really measure?

Compound 1 can be identified to transform to 2 in the attendance of bpy coligand, when the local geometry symmetry of eight-coordinated Dy(III) ion changes from a dodecahedron (D2d) in 1 to a square antiprism (D4d) in 2. Fine-tuning structure aroused by auxiliary ligand has dramatical impact on magnetic properties of compounds 1 and 2. Magnetic investigations demonstrate that both 1 and 2 display dynamic magnetic relaxation of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) behavior with different effective barriers (ΔE/kB) of 93.09 K for 1 under zero direct-current (DC) field as well as 296.50 K for 1 and 151.01 K for 2 under 1200 Oe DC field, respectively. As noticed, compound 1 possesses higher effective barrier than 2, despite 1 exhibiting a lower geometrical symmetry of the Dy(III) ion. Ab initio studies reveal that the Kramers doublet ground state is predominantly axial with the gz tensors of two compounds matching the Ising-limit factor of 20 anticipated for the pure MJ = ±15/2 state.

In this work, five new uranyl-based polyrotaxane compounds incorporating a sulfate or oxalate coligand have been hydrothermally synthesized via a mixed-ligand method. Based on C6BPCA@CB6 (C6BPCA = 1,1'-(hexane-1,6-diyl)bis(4-(carbonyl)pyridin-1-ium), CB6 = cucurbit[6]uril) ligand, UPS1 (UO2(L)0.5(SO4)(H2O)·2H2O, L = C6BPCA@CB6) is formed by the alteration of initial aqueous solution pH to a higher acidity. The resulting 2D uranyl polyrotaxane sheet structure of UPS1 is based on uranyl-sulfate ribbons connected by the C6BPCA@CB6 pseudorotaxane linkers. By using oxalate ligand instead of sulfate, four oxalate-containing uranyl polyrotaxane compounds, UPO1-UPO4, have been acquired by tuning reaction pH and ligand concentration: UPO1 (UO2(L)0.5(C2O4)0.5(NO3)·3H2O) in one-dimensional chain was obtained at a low pH value range (1.47-1.89) and UPO2 (UO2(L)(C2O4)(H2O)·7H2O)obtained at a higher pH value range (4.31-7.21).

The UPO1-UPO4 compounds, which display structural diversity via pH-dependent competitive effect of oxalate, represent the first series of mixed-ligand uranyl polyrotaxanes with organic ligand as the coligand. Moreover, the self-assembly process and its internal mechanism concerning pH-dependent competitive effect and other related factors such as concentration of the reagents and coordination behaviors of the coligands were discussed in detail.",28271899,2017,Mixed-Ligand Uranyl Polyrotaxanes Incorporating a Sulfate/Oxalate Coligand: Achieving Structural Diversity via pH-Dependent Competitive Effect.

Sequentially, in the Eu(IO3)3 solid matrix, we demonstrated that the IO3- site can be sufficiently substituted by SeO32- in the presence of Th4+ via simultaneous incorporation of Th4+ and SeO32- in a charge-balancing mechanism.

It is unclear how ethnic differences in HbA1c levels are affected by individual variations in mental wellbeing. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the extent to which HbA1c disparities between Caucasian and South Asian adults are mediated by various aspects of positive psychological functioning.


METHODS
Data from the 2014 Health Survey for England was analysed using bootstrapping methods. A total of 3894 UK residents with HbA1c data were eligible to participate. Mental wellbeing was assessed using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. To reduce bias BMI, blood pressure, diabetes status, and other factors were treated as covariates.


RESULTS
Ethnicity directly predicted blood sugar control (unadjusted coefficient -2.15; 95% CI -3.64, -0.67), with Caucasians generating lower average HbA1c levels (37.68 mmol/mol (5.6%)) compared to South Asians (39.87 mmol/mol (5.8%)). This association was mediated by positive mental wellbeing, specifically concerning perceived vigour (unadjusted effect 0.30; 95% CI 0.13, 0.58): South Asians felt more energetic than Caucasians (unadjusted coefficient -0.32; 95% CI -0.49, -0.16), and greater perceived energy predicted lower HbA1c levels (unadjusted coefficient -0.92; 95% CI -1.29, -0.55). This mediator effect accounted for just over 14% of the HbA1c variance and was negated after adjusting for BMI.

This study examined the impact of changes in social support on ethnic identity and HIV risk behaviors among migrant workers in South Florida. For this study, baseline and 6-month follow-up data were collected from an HIV intervention study among migrant workers in South Florida (n = 270) who reported unprotected sex in the past 30 days. The Multigroup Identity Measure was used to assess ethnic identity and the Social Provisions Scale examined the degree to which respondents' social relationships provide various dimensions of social support. Social support was a significant predictor of ethnic identity and of ethnic identity subscales, ethnic identity belonging and ethnic identity explore. There were small but statistically significant short-term changes in ethnic identity and ethnic identity subscales among the migrant workers over the 6-month time period assessed after controlling for the intervention. Future studies should be conducted over a longer period of time to better assess this relationship and possible factors to reduce HIV risk behaviors.

825,"With the development of wireless sensor networks, certain network problems have become more prominent, such as limited node resources, low data transmission security, and short network life cycles. To solve these problems effectively, it is important to design an efficient and trusted secure routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Traditional ant-colony optimization algorithms exhibit only local convergence, without considering the residual energy of the nodes and many other problems. This paper introduces a multi-attribute pheromone ant secure routing algorithm based on reputation value (MPASR). This algorithm can reduce the energy consumption of a network and improve the reliability of the nodes' reputations by filtering nodes with higher coincidence rates and improving the method used to update the nodes' communication behaviors. At the same time, the node reputation value, the residual node energy and the transmission delay are combined to formulate a synthetic pheromone that is used in the formula for calculating the random proportion rule in traditional ant-colony optimization to select the optimal data transmission path. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can increase both the security of data transmission and the quality of routing service.",28282894,2017,A Multi-Attribute Pheromone Ant Secure Routing Algorithm Based on Reputation Value for Sensor Networks.

Most believed hypertension is related to stress and salt intake, though few reported making the recommended lifestyle changes. None of the participants communicated with physicians in their native language, relying instead on interpreters, family members or other languages to communicate. Participants identified language as a serious barrier to care. Our sample had a poor understanding of hypertension as a chronic, asymptomatic disease.

828,"Enabling touch-sensing capability would help appliances understand interaction behaviors with their surroundings. Many recent studies are focusing on the development of electronic skin because of its necessity in various application domains, namely autonomous artificial intelligence (e.g., robots), biomedical instrumentation, and replacement prosthetic devices. An essential task of the electronic skin system is to locally process the tactile data and send structured information either to mimic human skin or to respond to the application demands. The electronic skin must be fabricated together with an embedded electronic system which has the role of acquiring the tactile data, processing, and extracting structured information. On the other hand, processing tactile data requires efficient methods to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data. Machine learning represents an effective method for data analysis in many domains: it has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in processing tactile sensor data. In this framework, this paper presents the implementation of digital signal processing based on FPGAs for tactile data processing. It provides the implementation of a tensorial kernel function for a machine learning approach. Implementation results are assessed by highlighting the FPGA resource utilization and power consumption. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed implementation when real-time classification of input touch modalities are targeted.",28287448,2017,Real-Time Digital Signal Processing Based on FPGAs for Electronic Skin Implementation.
829,"Spherical harmonics (SH) and mascon solutions are the two most common types of solutions for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass flux observations. However, SH signals are degraded by measurement and leakage errors. Mascon solutions (the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) release, herein) exhibit weakened signals at submascon resolutions. Both solutions require a scale factor examined by the CLM4.0 model to obtain the actual water storage signal. The Slepian localization method can avoid the SH leakage errors when applied to the basin scale. In this study, we estimate SH errors and scale factors for African hydrological regimes. Then, terrestrial water storage (TWS) in Africa is determined based on Slepian localization and compared with JPL-mascon and SH solutions. The three TWS estimates show good agreement for the TWS of large-sized and humid regimes but present discrepancies for the TWS of medium and small-sized regimes. Slepian localization is an effective method for deriving the TWS of arid zones. The TWS behavior in African regimes and its spatiotemporal variations are then examined. The negative TWS trends in the lower Nile and Sahara at -1.08 and -6.92 Gt/year, respectively, are higher than those previously reported.",28287453,2017,"Terrestrial Water Storage in African Hydrological Regimes Derived from GRACE Mission Data: Intercomparison of Spherical Harmonics, Mass Concentration, and Scalar Slepian Methods."
830,"Multisystemic therapy (MST) was developed to help youth with serious social, emotional, and behavioral problems. Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of MST has shown positive outcomes in different domains of development and functioning among various populations of youth. Nonetheless, even with a large body of literature investigating the treatment effects of MST, few studies have focused on the effectiveness of MST through large-scale dissemination efforts. Utilizing a large sample of youth involved in a statewide dissemination of MST (n = 740; 43% females; 14% Black; 29% Hispanic; 49% White; Mage = 14.9 years), propensity score matching was employed to account for baseline differences between the treatment (n = 577) and comparison (n = 163) groups. Treatment effects were examined based on three outcomes: out-of-home placement, adjudication, and placement in a juvenile training school over a 6-year period. Significant group differences remained after adjusting for baseline differences, with youth who received MST experiencing better outcomes in offending rates than youth who did not have an opportunity to complete MST due to non-clinical or administrative reasons. Survival analyses revealed rates of all three outcomes were approximately 40% lower among the treatment group. Overall, this study adds to the body of literature supporting the long-term effectiveness of MST in reducing offending among high-risk youth. The findings underscore the potential benefits of taking evidence-based programs such as MST to scale to improve the well-being and functioning of high-risk youth. However, strategies to effectively deliver the program in mental health service settings, and to address the specific needs of high-risk youth are necessary.",28315074,2017,Placement and Delinquency Outcomes Among System-Involved Youth Referred to Multisystemic Therapy: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.
831,"BACKGROUND
As restrictions on marijuana are loosened, there is concern of a coming increase in marijuana use among adolescents and emerging adults, which could be coupled with commensurate increases in behavioral problems associated with use, such as physical dating violence (PDV). To summarize what is known about the association between marijuana use and PDV victimization and perpetration among 11-21year olds, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature published between 2003 and 2015.


METHODS
Candidate articles were identified with a systematic search, and we used inclusion and exclusion criteria to review titles, abstracts, and the full text of studies for consideration. There were 13 articles examining marijuana in association with PDV; five addressed victimization and 11 addressed perpetration.


RESULTS
Findings suggest that marijuana use is associated with a 54% increase in the odds PDV victimization, and a 45% increase in the odds of perpetration.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest that dating violence is a correlate of marijuana use, and that association is strongest among adolescents (vs. emerging adults) and girls (vs. boys). Therefore, it should be routinely included as a core data item in marijuana surveillance systems, so as to allow for behavioral monitoring.",28314193,2017,Marijuana use and physical dating violence among adolescents and emerging adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
832,"Corannulene, C20H10, exhibits a concave surface in the ground state that is able to experience a bowl-to-bowl inversion through a planar conformation. Such a structure is the smaller example resembling an isolated-pentagon motif, as a relevant fragment in fullerene chemistry. Here, we explored the differences between bowl and planar conformations involving both energetic and 13C NMR properties, for the neutral and tetraanionic species by using density functional theory (DFT) methods. This allows us to understand the variation of the chemical environment at the carbon atoms upon planarization of this representive motif. Our results reveal that the variation of the chemical shift comes about from the variation of different main components of the shielding tensor, according to the relative position of the carbon atoms in the structure (i.e., rim, hub, and protonated), which is more relevant for both hub and protonated sites, in contrast to the rim carbon remaining almost unshifted. Interestingly, the planar transition state exhibits a more favorable bonding situation than the bowl-shaped conformation; however, the higher strain is enough to overcome this extra stabilization. Upon reduction to the tetraanionic counterpart (C20H104-), a lesser strain in the planar conformation is observed, decreasing the inversion barrier. In addition, the formation of the concentric aromatic ring systems in C20H104-, results in a more axially symmetric chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor for the hub carbons, accounting in a local manner, for the concentric aromatic behavior in such structure in contrast to the neutral parent. These observations can be useful to evaluate the aromatic behavior of teh isolated-pentagon rule (IPR) motif in fullerene cages.",28319378,2017,Computational Study of 13C NMR Chemical Shift Anisotropy Patterns in C20H10 and [C20H10]4-.

These materials can act as anode active materials in aqueous rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (ARLBs). NaV6O15 has a charge transfer resistance of several ohms in the ARLB, which is an order of magnitude smaller than in traditional lithium-ion batteries. The lithium-ion diffusion coefficients at 0.15, -0.21 and -0.65 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were calculated as 7.3 × 10-9, 3 × 10-12, 7.6 × 10-11 cm2 s-1, respectively, from the Warburg spectrum, which were three orders of magnitude larger than in conventional lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, NaV6O15 materials used in this ARLB have a high energy density of about 134.9 Wh kg-1 at a power of 640 W kg-1. In contrast to traditional LIB behavior, we found that the capacity retention and coulombic efficiency of the as-synthesized materials increased with the increasing ARLB discharge current density, which showed potential for this new ARLB system to be applied in the field of large-scale energy storage and power source devices.",28322399,2017,Lithium-ion storage properties of a micro/nanosheet-like NaV6O15 anode in aqueous solution.
834,"Biodegradable Mg alloys have the potential to replace currently used metallic medical implant devices, likely eliminating toxicity concerns and the need for secondary surgeries, while also providing a potentially stimulating environment for tissue growth. A recently developed Mg-Ca-Sr alloy possesses advantageous characteristics over other Mg alloys, having a good combination of strength and degradation behavior, while also displaying potentially osteogenic properties. To better understand the effect of alloy degradation products on cellular mechanisms, in vitro studies using human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were conducted. Ionic products of alloy dissolution were found to be nontoxic but changed the proliferation profile of stem cells. Furthermore, their presence changed the progress of osteogenic development, while concentrations of Mg in particular appeared to induce stem cell differentiation. The work presented herein provides a foundation for future alloy design where structures can be tailored to obtain specific implant performance. These potentially bioactive implants would reduce the risks for patients by shortening their healing time, minimizing discomfort and toxicity concerns, while reducing hospital costs. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

835,"PURPOSE
The purpose of the study was to estimate the size and bone thickness at the margin of the foramen magnum in a pediatric population.


METHODS
Sixty occipital bone specimens from the collection of macerated skulls at the Department of Anatomy, University of Zagreb, were examined and measured using a vernier scale/caliper. For the purpose of analysis, specimens were divided into two age groups: 1-6 years and 7-18 years of age (before and after the fusion of ossification centers in the occipital bone). We measured the following: antero-posterior and transverse diameters of the foramen magnum, bone thicknesses at the basion, opisthion, two paramedial points on the anterior and posterior margins, and at the occipito-squamous junction.


RESULTS
Data presented in this study show that diameters of the foramen magnum increase with age, whereas bone thickness shows variable behavior depending on the measured area.


CONCLUSIONS
Increases in diameters in specimens from the younger age group and their absence in specimens from older subjects reflect the growth pattern of the basilar part of occipital bone. Variability of bone thickness at the margin of the foramen magnum and lack of its association with age of the subjects may be attributed to various factors and may potentially affect the clinical presentation of compression syndromes at the level of foramen magnum.",28324185,2017,Diameters and bone thickness at the margin of the foramen magnum in dry skulls from pediatric population: a cross-sectional anatomical study.

Fifty-five participants of increasing age (20-30, 40-50, 60-70, 75-85years old) were recruited. Behavioral and EEG data were collected during a lexical decision task, in which words and symbol strings were presented. Analyses of EEG data focused mainly on three major points: visual expertise for print, automatization of the expertise and differences in attentional demand between the processing of words and symbols. Results indicated a preservation of visual expertise with age, with larger N170 amplitude for words than for symbols. Moreover, a decrease in stimulus processing speed was observed as a function of age. No difference in attentional demand as a function of stimulus was observed.",28327370,2017,The effects of age on visual expertise for print.
837,"The increase in the popularity of social media has shattered the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. The content generated by people or social sensors on social media provides information about users and their living surroundings, which allows us to access a user's preferences, opinions, and interactions. This provides an opportunity for us to understand human behavior and enhance the services provided for both the real and virtual worlds. In this paper, we will focus on the popularity prediction of social images on Flickr, a popular social photo-sharing site, and promote the research on utilizing social sensory data in the context of assisting people to improve their life on the Web. Social data are different from the data collected from physical sensors; in the fact that they exhibit special characteristics that pose new challenges. In addition to their huge quantity, social data are noisy, unstructured, and heterogeneous. Moreover, they involve human semantics and contextual data that require analysis and interpretation based on human behavior. Accordingly, we address the problem of popularity prediction for an image by exploiting three main factors that are important for making an image popular. In particular, we investigate the impact of the image's visual content, where the semantic and sentiment information extracted from the image show an impact on its popularity, as well as the textual information associated with the image, which has a fundamental role in boosting the visibility of the image in the keyword search results. Additionally, we explore social context, such as an image owner's popularity and how it positively influences the image popularity. With a comprehensive study on the effect of the three aspects, we further propose to jointly consider the heterogeneous social sensory data. Experimental results obtained from real-world data demonstrate that the three factors utilized complement each other in obtaining promising results in the prediction of image popularity on social photo-sharing site.",28335498,2017,On the Prediction of Flickr Image Popularity by Analyzing Heterogeneous Social Sensory Data.
838,"The flexibility of amorphous Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) micro wires makes them easy to use in several magnetic field sensing applications, such as electrical current sensing, where they need to be deformed in order to be aligned with the measured field. The present paper deals with the bending impact, as a parameter of influence of the sensor, on the GMI effect in 100 µm Co-rich amorphous wires. Changes in the values of key parameters associated with the GMI effect have been investigated under bending stress. These parameters included the GMI ratio, the intrinsic sensitivity, and the offset at a given bias field. The experimental results have shown that bending the wire resulted in a reduction of GMI ratio and sensitivity. The bending also induced a net change in the offset for the considered bending curvature and the set of used excitation parameters (1 MHz, 1 mA). Furthermore, the field of the maximum impedance, which is generally related to the anisotropy field of the wire, was increased. The reversibility and the repeatability of the bending effect were also evaluated by applying repetitive bending stresses. The observations have actually shown that the behavior of the wire under the bending stress was roughly reversible and repetitive.",28335542,2017,The Impact of Bending Stress on the Performance of Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) Magnetic Sensors.
839,"The prospect of Line-of-Business Services (LoBSs) for infrastructure of Emerging Sensor Networks (ESNs) is exciting. Access control remains a top challenge in this scenario as the service provider's server contains a lot of valuable resources. LoBSs' users are very diverse as they may come from a wide range of locations with vastly different characteristics. Cost of joining could be low and in many cases, intruders are eligible users conducting malicious actions. As a result, user access should be adjusted dynamically. Assessing LoBSs' risk dynamically based on both frequency and threat degree of malicious operations is therefore necessary. In this paper, we proposed a Quantitative Risk Assessment Model (QRAM) involving frequency and threat degree based on value at risk. To quantify the threat degree as an elementary intrusion effort, we amend the influence coefficient of risk indexes in the network security situation assessment model. To quantify threat frequency as intrusion trace effort, we make use of multiple behavior information fusion. Under the influence of intrusion trace, we adapt the historical simulation method of value at risk to dynamically access LoBSs' risk. Simulation based on existing data is used to select appropriate parameters for QRAM. Our simulation results show that the duration influence on elementary intrusion effort is reasonable when the normalized parameter is 1000. Likewise, the time window of intrusion trace and the weight between objective risk and subjective risk can be set to 10 s and 0.5, respectively. While our focus is to develop QRAM for assessing the risk of LoBSs for infrastructure of ESNs dynamically involving frequency and threat degree, we believe it is also appropriate for other scenarios in cloud computing.",28335569,2017,A Quantitative Risk Assessment Model Involving Frequency and Threat Degree under Line-of-Business Services for Infrastructure of Emerging Sensor Networks.

In addition, considerable evidence in the cancer literature supports the value of mindfulness-based interventions as a means of helping patients and survivors cope with the variety of threats that accompany this disease. Based on the success of these two areas of research, we argue for conceptualizing and promoting physical activity as Mindfulness-Based Movement, using Polyvagal Theory as a theoretical framework to understand the role and value of Mindfulness-Based Movement as a potential intervention for cancer care and control.",28345362,2018,Mindfulness-Based Movement: A Polyvagal Perspective.
842,"Flexible inorganic-organic silica aerogels based on methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS, CH3Si(OCH3)3) can overcome the drawbacks of conventional silica aerogels by introducing high mechanical strength, elastic recovery and hydrophobicity to monolithic materials. In this work, MTMS is co-condensed with organofunctional alkoxysilanes RSi(OMe)3 (R = vinyl, chloropropyl, mercaptopropyl, methacryloxypropyl, etc.) yielding aerogels that are not only flexible but also contain reactive functional groups. Sol-gel parameters, such as the MTMS/RSi(OMe)3 ratio, have been systematically investigated in terms of gelation behavior, complete/incomplete incorporation of the functional organic groups (confirmed by FTIR-ATR and Raman spectroscopy) and flexibility of the resulting gel. Sterically more demanding functional moieties lead to macroscopic phase separation; however, this problem was overcome by the employment of surfactants. Functional aerogels dried by supercritical extraction with carbon dioxide showed promising results in uniaxial compression tests and had an elastic recovery up to 60%. Furthermore, the accessibility of the functional groups was demonstrated by simple reactions, e.g. conversion of the chloro into azido groups via a nucleophilic substitution reaction with NaN3 followed by click reactions.",28352868,2017,Flexible organofunctional aerogels.
843,"Chemotherapy induced cognitive impairment (i.e. chemobrain) involves acute and long-term deficits in memory, executive function, and processing speed. Animal studies investigating these cognitive deficits have had mixed results, potentially due to variability in the complexity of behavioral tasks across experiments. Further, common chemotherapy treatments such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) break down myelin integrity corresponding to hippocampal neurodegenerative deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction. There is little evidence, however, of pharmacological treatments that may target mitochondrial dysfunction. Using a differential reinforcement of low rates (DRL) task combining spatial and temporal components, the current study evaluated the preventative effects of the pharmacological agent KU32 on the behavior of rats treated with 5-FU (5-FU+Saline vs. 5FU+KU32). DRL performance was analyzed the day after the first set of injections (D1), the day after the second set of injections (D7) and the last day of the experiment (D14). The 5FU+KU32 group earned significantly more reinforcers on the DRL task at D7 and D14 than the 5FU+Saline group. Further, the 5FU+KU32 group showed significantly better temporal discrimination. The 5FU+KU32 showed within-group improvement in temporal discrimination from D7 to D14. No significant differences were observed in spatial discrimination, however, those in the 5FU+Saline group responded more frequently on T3 compared to the 5FU+KU32 group, highlighting temporal discrimination differences between groups. The current data suggest that KU32 shows promise in the prevention of chemotherapy induced impairments in temporal discrimination.",28359881,2017,KU32 prevents 5-fluorouracil induced cognitive impairment.
844,"While developmental consequences of parental investment on species-typical social behaviors has been extensively characterized in same-sex parent-offspring interactions, the impact of opposite-sex relationships is less clear. In the bi-parental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), paternal retrieval behavior induces territorial aggression and the expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in adult male offspring. Although similar patterns of territorially emerge among females, the sexually dimorphic AVP system has not been considered since it is generally thought to regulate male-typical behavior. However, we recently demonstrated that male and female P. californicus offspring experience increases in plasma testosterone following paternal retrieval. Since AVP expression is androgen-dependent during development, we postulate that increases in AVP expression may accompany territoriality in female, as well as male offspring. To explore this aim, adult P. californicus offspring that received either high or low levels of paternal care (retrievals) during early development were tested for territoriality and immunohistochemical analysis of AVP within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Consistent with previous studies, high care offspring were more aggressive than low care offspring. Moreover, high care offspring had significantly more AVP immunoreactive (AVP-ir) cells within the BNST than low care offspring. This pattern was observed within female as well as male offspring, suggesting an equally salient role for paternal care on female offspring physiology. Regardless of early social experience, sex differences in AVP persisted in the BNST, with males having greater expression than females.",28359742,2017,Increased vasopressin expression in the BNST accompanies paternally induced territoriality in male and female California mouse offspring.
845,"OBJECTIVE
Obstetric anal sphincter injury is common but the effect on body image is unreported. The aim of this study was to explore patient perceived changes in body image and other psychological aspects in women attending a perineal follow-up clinic.


STUDY DESIGN
This retrospective study analysed women's responses to a self-reported questionnaire. Consecutive women with anal sphincter injury who attended a United Kingdom Maternity Hospital perineal follow-up clinic between January 1999 and January 2012 were identified and the records obtained and reviewed. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to examine variables influencing self-reported change in body image.


RESULTS
Questionnaires and operation notes were analysed from 422 women who attended at a median of four months after delivery. 222 (53%) reported a change in body image with 80 (19%) reporting lower self-esteem and 75 (18%) a change in their personality due to the change in body image. 248 (59%) perceived an anatomical change due to the delivery. Factors associated with increased likelihood of reporting a change in body image were reporting a perceived change in anatomy due to the delivery, adjusted OR 6.11 (3.56-10.49), anal incontinence, OR 1.97 (1.16-3.36), and delivery by forceps, OR 2.59 (1.23-5.43).


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to quantify body image changes in women after anal sphincter injury sustained in childbirth. These were found to be very common, affecting up to 50% of women. The study has several limitations but it does highlight the significant psychosocial problems of negative self-esteem and personality changes associated with a perceived change in body image that has not previously been reported.

846,"OBJECTIVE
Ovarian quiescence is a common condition during pregnancy. In vitro, follistatin, an antagonist of follicle-stimulating hormone, blocks follicular development at early stages, and its serum levels increase during pregnancy. A possible surrogate biomarker of ovarian arrest during pregnancy is a decrease in anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels followed by an increase in these levels on the second day after labor. The purpose of this study was to determine whether follistatin could act as an ovarian-suppressing agent during pregnancy. Follistatin levels and AMH levels were determined at various stages of pregnancy and postpartum.


STUDY DESIGN
The follistatin and AMH levels of 69 patients were retrospectively determined with the AMH Gen II ELISA and with the Human Follistatin Quantikine ELISA Kit. For 49 patients, samples were available from various trimesters for cross-sectional analysis; for the other 20, samples were available longitudinally from day one before labor and then daily on days 1 through 4 after labor. Statistical significance was determined with linear regression, the Friedman rank sum test and the Wilcoxon-Nemenyi-McDonald-Thompson post hoc test.


RESULTS
The behavior of follistatin levels was exactly opposite that of AMH levels: Follistatin levels increased significantly during pregnancy and on the first day after parturition but declined afterwards, whereas AMH levels decreased significantly during pregnancy and increased after labor.

847,"Previous placebo-controlled experimental studies have shown that a single dose of MDMA can increase emotional empathy in the multifaceted empathy test (MET) without affecting cognitive empathy. Although sufficiently powered to detect main effects of MDMA, these studies were generally underpowered to also validly assess contributions of additional parameters, such as sex, drug use history, trait empathy and MDMA or oxytocin plasma concentrations. The present study examined the robustness of the MDMA effect on empathy and investigated the moderating role of these additional parameters. Participants ( n = 118) from six placebo-controlled within-subject studies and two laboratories were included in the present pooled analysis. Empathy (MET), MDMA and oxytocin plasma concentrations were assessed after oral administration of MDMA (single dose, 75 or 125 mg). Trait empathy was assessed using the interpersonal reactivity index. We confirmed that MDMA increased emotional empathy at both doses without affecting cognitive empathy. This MDMA-related increase in empathy was most pronounced during presentation of positive emotions as compared with negative emotions. MDMA-induced empathy enhancement was positively related to MDMA blood concentrations measured before the test, but independent of sex, drug use history and trait empathy. Oxytocin concentrations increased after MDMA administration but were not associated with behavioral effects. The MDMA effects on emotional empathy were stable across laboratories and doses. Sex did not play a moderating role in this effect, and oxytocin levels, trait empathy and drug use history were also unrelated.

848,"INTRODUCTION
Teachable moments (TMs) are situations with potential for promoting health behavior change. Little is known as to whether colonoscopy screening itself may serve as a TM, particularly among low-income or minority populations. Research in this area is needed to inform efforts to address the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) experienced by minorities.


AIMS
This study aims to describe attitudes related to physical activity (PA) and healthy eating among a low-income Hispanic and African American sample, assess whether colonoscopy completion may encourage changes in dietary behavior or PA, and determine the type of interventions minority participants would prefer to promote preventive behaviors.


METHODS
Average-risk African American and Hispanic individuals who are referred for a screening colonoscopy at a Primary Care Clinic between May 2008 and December 2011 were eligible. Data were collected at three time points: at recruitment, 2 weeks before their colonoscopy, and 1 month after their colonoscopy (n = 537).


RESULTS
The difference in change in PA from baseline to post-colonoscopy follow-up between those who had a colonoscopy and those who did not was significant (p = .04). Those who completed a colonoscopy increased their PA by 0.26 days on average, whereas, those who did not decreased their PA by 0.46 days.


DISCUSSION
Findings suggest that the time following colonoscopy completion may be ideal to provide health promotion for PA and healthy eating. Future research is needed to explore the mechanisms that influence health behavior change as a result of colonoscopies to inform the development of interventions in this area.",28374335,2018,Preventive Health Behaviors Among Low-Income African American and Hispanic Populations: Can Colonoscopy Screening Serve as a Teachable Moment?
849,"OBJECTIVE
Family caregivers of people with dementia often report high levels of stress and depression, but little is known about those who contemplate suicide or self-harm. This study explores thoughts of suicide, self-harm and death in dementia caregivers and investigates the characteristics that distinguish them from those without such thoughts.


METHODS
Data were collected every 3 months, for 24 months, from 192 family caregivers of people with dementia living in the Netherlands. Caregivers did not have a clinical depression or anxiety disorder at baseline. Suicide-related thoughts were measured with an item from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a diagnostic instrument for DSM-IV mental disorders. Fisher exact, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests compared the characteristics of caregivers who had contemplated suicide with two comparison groups.


RESULTS
Within 24 months, 76 caregivers reported symptoms of a potential depression and were further assessed for suicidal thoughts. Nine carers (11.8%, 4.7% of the total sample) reported suicidal thoughts with three of those at multiple points. Caregivers with suicidal thoughts had more severe depressive and anxious symptoms, had a lower sense of competence and mastery, felt less happy and experienced more health problems, less family support and more feelings of loneliness than caregivers who had not.


CONCLUSION
Suicidal thoughts are present in dementia caregivers and can persist across the care trajectory. Various psychological and social characteristics significantly distinguish caregivers with suicidal thoughts from those without. More research is needed to enable the identification of high-risk caregivers and provide an evidence base for the development of preventive strategies and interventions. © 2017 The Authors.

850,"When attempting to predict future events, people commonly rely on historical data. One psychological characteristic of judgmental forecasting of time series, established by research, is that when people make forecasts from series, they tend to underestimate future values for upward trends and overestimate them for downward ones, so-called trend-damping (modeled by anchoring on, and insufficient adjustment from, the average of recent time series values). Events in a time series can be experienced sequentially (dynamic mode), or they can also be retrospectively viewed simultaneously (static mode), not experienced individually in real time. In one experiment, we studied the influence of presentation mode (dynamic and static) on two sorts of judgment: (a) predictions of the next event (forecast) and (b) estimation of the average value of all the events in the presented series (average estimation). Participants' responses in dynamic mode were anchored on more recent events than in static mode for all types of judgment but with different consequences; hence, dynamic presentation improved prediction accuracy, but not estimation. These results are not anticipated by existing theoretical accounts; we develop and present an agent-based model-the adaptive anchoring model (ADAM)-to account for the difference between processing sequences of dynamically and statically presented stimuli (visually presented data). ADAM captures how variation in presentation mode produces variation in responses (and the accuracy of these responses) in both forecasting and judgment tasks. ADAM's model predictions for the forecasting and judgment tasks fit better with the response data than a linear-regression time series model. Moreover, ADAM outperformed autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) and exponential-smoothing models, while neither of these models accounts for people's responses on the average estimation task.",28382639,2018,Adaptive Anchoring Model: How Static and Dynamic Presentations of Time Series Influence Judgments and Predictions.
851,"An integrated deterministic and stochastic model within the master equation/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (ME/RRKM) framework was first used to characterize temperature- and pressure-dependent behaviors of thermal decomposition of acetic anhydride in a wide range of conditions (i.e., 300-1500 K and 0.001-100 atm). Particularly, using potential energy surface and molecular properties obtained from high-level electronic structure calculations at CCSD(T)/CBS, macroscopic thermodynamic properties and rate coefficients of the title reaction were derived with corrections for hindered internal rotation and tunneling treatments. Being in excellent agreement with the scattered experimental data, the results from deterministic and stochastic frameworks confirmed and complemented each other to reveal that the main decomposition pathway proceeds via a 6-membered-ring transition state with the 0 K barrier of 35.2 kcal·mol-1. This observation was further understood and confirmed by the sensitivity analysis on the time-resolved species profiles and the derived rate coefficients with respect to the ab initio barriers. Such an agreement suggests the integrated model can be confidently used for a wide range of conditions as a powerful postfacto and predictive tool in detailed chemical kinetic modeling and simulation for the title reaction and thus can be extended to complex chemical reactions.",28383887,2017,Kinetics of Thermal Unimolecular Decomposition of Acetic Anhydride: An Integrated Deterministic and Stochastic Model.
852,"Syrian hamsters readily display territorial aggression. If they lose even a single agonistic encounter, however, hamsters show striking reductions in aggressive behavior and increases in submissive behavior, a distinct behavioral change that we have previously termed conditioned defeat. This acute social defeat stressor is primarily psychological and is effective in both males and females. Therefore, we maintain that this procedure presents an ideal model for studying behavioral and physiological responses to social stress. Here, we demonstrate that social avoidance following social defeat is a particularly useful dependent measure because of its sensitivity and stability between sexes and across the estrous cycle. In addition, we demonstrate that peripubertal hamsters exposed to a single, 15min social defeat exhibit significantly more social avoidance 24h later when compared with no-defeat controls. Later, defeated and non-defeated hamsters display similar agonistic behavior in adulthood indicating that the peripubertal defeat does not alter adult territorial aggression. After experiencing an additional social defeat in adulthood, however, the hamsters that experienced the pubertal defeat respond to the adult defeat with increased social avoidance when compared with hamsters that were defeated only in adulthood and with no-defeat controls. These data are the first to show that a single social defeat in puberty increases susceptibility to later social defeat in both males and females.",28390864,2017,An acute social defeat stressor in early puberty increases susceptibility to social defeat in adulthood.

These compounds crystallize in the hexagonal Hf5Sn3Cu-anti type structure (space group: P63/mcm) consisting of face-sharing MBi6 octahedral chains and hypervalent Bi linear chains, both separated by La atoms. Magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements revealed that all of the compounds, including the solid solution La3Ti(Bi1-xSbx)5, exhibit a Pauli paramagnetic behavior without any trace of superconductivity down to 1.85 K, as opposed to a recently reported 4 K superconductivity in La3TiSb5. The absence of superconductivity is supported by first-principles band calculations of La3TiBi5 and La3TiSb5 that demonstrate similar electronic structures with three-dimensional Fermi surfaces.",28394568,2017,"Hypervalent Bismuthides La3MBi5 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) and Related Antimonides: Absence of Superconductivity."
854,"Alginate (Alg) is a renewable polymer with excellent hemostatic properties and biocapability and is widely used for hemostatic wound dressing. However, the swelling properties of alginate-based wound dressings need to be promoted to meet the requirements of wider application. Poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) is a natural polymer with high hydrophility. In the current study, novel Alg/PGA composite microparticles with double network structure were prepared by the emulsification/internal gelation method. It was found from the structure characterization that a double network structure was formed in the composite microparticles due to the ion chelation interaction between Ca2+ and the carboxylate groups of Alg and PGA and the electrostatic interaction between the secondary amine group of PGA and the carboxylate groups of Alg and PGA. The swelling behavior of the composite microparticles was significantly improved due to the high hydrophility of PGA. Influences of the preparing conditions on the swelling behavior of the composites were investigated. The porous microparticles could be formed while compositing of PGA. Thermal stability was studied by thermogravimetric analysis method. Moreover, in vitro cytocompatibility test of microparticles exhibited good biocompatibility with L929 cells. All results indicated that such Alg/PGA composite microparticles are a promising candidate in the field of wound dressing for hemostasis or rapid removal of exudates.",28398222,2017,"Preparation, Characterization and Properties of Alginate/Poly(γ-glutamic acid) Composite Microparticles."
855,"The synthesis and photophysical properties of two multichromophoric systems, Pt(II)/B(III) and Pt(II)/Ir(III), based on novel N^O-julolidine ligands are reported. The functionalization of the julolidine core enables the introduction of two different anchoring sites, a terminal acetylene and an N^O chelating moiety, which allow the assembling of two different chromophoric centers. The complex photophysical behavior of these multicomponent arrays is rationalized by investigating a series of model compounds, which are prepared through specific synthetic pathways. The photophysical properties of the final multicomponent arrays are investigated in parallel with the models. The multichromophoric system, composed by a platinum(II) and an iridium(III) chromophore connected through a modified julolidine ditopic ligand, displays a peculiar excitation wavelength dependent luminescence behavior.

Desolvation of coordinated solvent molecules in these complexes made their handling difficult. However, using a number of functionalized silanide ligands, complexes with a diminished number or even no coordinated solvent molecules were obtained ((R3Si)2Ln(THF)x (x = 0-3)). The structures of all new lanthanide compounds were determined by X-ray single-crystal structure analysis. NMR spectroscopic analysis of some Yb-silyl complexes pointed at highly ionic interactions between the silyl ligands and the lanthanides. This bonding picture was supported by DFT calculations at the B3PW91/Basis1 level of theory. Detailed theoretical analysis of a disilylated Eu(II) complex suggests that its singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) are very close in energy to the ligand silicon lone pairs (HOMO), and SQUID magnetometry measurements of the complex showed a deviation from the expected behavior for a free Eu(II) ion, which might be due to a ligand-metal interaction.",28398724,2017,Using Functionalized Silyl Ligands To Suppress Solvent Coordination to Silyl Lanthanide(II) Complexes.
857,"The systems of perception and action of the brain appear as important constraining factors in human evolution under current models of embodied cognition. In this view, the emergence of certain items in the archeological record is not necessarily subsequent to the emergence of a 'symbolic' mind, but instead to the appearance of the sensory-motor systems enabling that behavior. One of the products normally absent in pre- Homo sapiens species is the standardized microlith, whose production seems very demanding for the hand due to their small size and need for fine craft. In the present study, we provide preliminary empirical evidence that the biomechanical requirements of microliths manufacture made this industry difficult to achieve by Neanderthals. The biomechanical parameters of the human hand in the manufacture of microliths are here explored in two individuals with different degrees of expertise. The figures obtained in this manner are subsequently contrasted and extrapolated to Neanderthal's hand anthropometric data, as obtained from the available literature. Results indicate that Neanderthals would exhibit lower efficiency than modern humans as a consequence of their smaller hands and shorter arms, resulting in a smaller area to distribute forces and an increased mechanical stress in the microlith manufacturing processes. This might be a plausibly contributing factor for precluding microlith production in Neanderthals on noticeable scales, in consonance with the archeological record.",28398903,2017,Biomechanics of microliths manufacture: a preliminary approach to Neanderthal's motor constrains in the frame of embodied cognition.
858,"The cubic semiconducting compounds APd3O4 (A = Ca, Sr) can be hole-doped by Na substitution on the A site and driven toward more conducting states. This process has been followed here by a number of experimental techniques to understand the evolution of electronic properties. While an insulator-to-metal transition is observed in Ca1-xNaxPd3O4 for x ≥ 0.15, bulk metallic behavior is not observed for Sr1-xNaxPd3O4 up to x = 0.20. Given the very similar crystal and (calculated) electronic structures of the two materials, the distinct behavior is a matter of interest. We present evidence of local disorder in the A = Sr materials through the analysis of the neutron pair distribution function, which is potentially at the heart of the distinct behavior. Solid-state 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance studies additionally suggest a percolative insulator-to-metal transition mechanism, wherein presumably small regions with a signal resembling metallic NaPd3O4 form almost immediately upon Na substitution, and this signal grows monotonically with substitution. Some signatures of increased local disorder and a propensity for Na clustering are seen in the A = Sr compounds.",28406617,2017,"The Role of Structural and Compositional Heterogeneities in the Insulator-to-Metal Transition in Hole-Doped APd3O4 (A = Ca, Sr)."
859,"Five heteroleptic lanthanide porphyrin-bis-phthalocyanine triple-decker complexes with bulky peripheral groups were prepared via microwave-assisted synthesis and characterized in terms of their spectroscopic, electrochemical, and magnetic properties. These compounds, which were easily obtained under our preparative conditions, would normally not be accessible in large quantities using conventional synthetic methods, as a result of the low yield resulting from steric congestion of bulky groups on the periphery of the phthalocyanine and porphyrin ligands. The electrochemically investigated triple-decker derivatives undergo four reversible one-electron oxidations and three reversible one-electron reductions. The sites of oxidation and reduction were assigned on the basis of redox potentials and UV-vis spectral changes during electron-transfer processes monitored by thin-layer spectroelectrochemistry, in conjunction with assignments of electronic absorption bands of the neutral compounds. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on two derivatives containing TbIII and DyIII metal ions reveal the presence of ferromagnetic interactions, probably resulting from magnetic dipolar interactions. The TbIII derivative shows SMM behavior under an applied field of 0.1 T, where the direct and Orbach process can be determined, resulting in an energy barrier of Ueff = 132.0 K. However, Cole-Cole plots reveal the presence of two relaxation processes, the second of which takes place at higher frequencies, with the data conforming to a 1/t ∝ T7 relation, thus suggesting that it can be assigned to a Raman process. Attempts were made to form two-dimensional (2D) self-assembled networks on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface but were unsuccessful due to bulky peripheral groups on the two Pc macrocycles.",28406618,2017,Microwave-Mediated Synthesis of Bulky Lanthanide Porphyrin-Phthalocyanine Triple-Deckers: Electrochemical and Magnetic Properties.

Both complexes crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pbca and present square pyramidal Cu(II) ions bridged into chains by chloride ions with each copper(II) bearing a single pyridine ligand. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were well fit by a uniform one-dimensional ferromagnetic chain model with 2, J = 69.0(7) K, C = 0.487 emu-K/mol-Oe; 3, J = 73.9(4) K, C = 0.463 emu-K/mol-Oe (H = -JΣSi·Sj Hamiltonian). The experimental J-values were confirmed via theoretical calculations. Comparison to a known disordered polymorph of dichloro(2-chloro-3-methylpyridine)copper(II), 1, shows marked differences as there are significant antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor interactions in 1 in addition to randomness induced by the disorder which provide a distinctly different magnetic response. The differences in magnetic behavior are attributed principally to the structural difference in the Cu(II) coordination sphere, 1 being significantly closer to trigonal-bipyramidal, whose difference changes both the nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions.",28406628,2017,Ferromagnetic Exchange in Bichloride Bridged Cu(II) Chains: Magnetostructural Correlations between Ordered and Disordered Systems.
861,"Segmenting word units from running speech is a fundamental skill infants must develop in order to acquire language. Despite ample behavioral evidence of this skill, its neurocognitive basis remains unclear. Using behavioral testing and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, we aimed to uncover the neurocognitive substrates of word segmentation and its development. Of three age-groups of Japanese infants (5-6, 7-8, and 9-10months of age), the two older age-groups showed significantly larger temporo-parietal (particularly supramarginal gyrus) responses to target words repeatedly presented for training, than to control words. After the training, they also exhibited stronger inferior frontal responses to target words embedded in sentences. These findings suggest that word segmentation largely involves a cerebral circuit of phonological (phonetic) short-term memory. The dorsal pathway involved in encoding and decoding phonological representation may start to function stably at around 7months of age to facilitate the growth of the infant's vocabulary.",28407509,2017,Infant word segmentation recruits the cerebral network of phonological short-term memory.
862,"In an implicit phonological priming paradigm, deaf bimodal bilinguals made semantic relatedness decisions for pairs of English words. Half of the semantically unrelated pairs had phonologically related translations in American Sign Language (ASL). As in previous studies with unimodal bilinguals, targets in pairs with phonologically related translations elicited smaller negativities than targets in pairs with phonologically unrelated translations within the N400 window. This suggests that the same lexicosemantic mechanism underlies implicit co-activation of a non-target language, irrespective of language modality. In contrast to unimodal bilingual studies that find no behavioral effects, we observed phonological interference, indicating that bimodal bilinguals may not suppress the non-target language as robustly. Further, there was a subset of bilinguals who were aware of the ASL manipulation (determined by debrief), and they exhibited an effect of ASL phonology in a later time window (700-900ms). Overall, these results indicate modality-independent language co-activation that persists longer for bimodal bilinguals.",28407510,2017,Implicit co-activation of American Sign Language in deaf readers: An ERP study.

864,"Achieving tailorable gated adsorption by tuning the dynamic behavior of a host porous material is of great interest because of its practical application in gas adsorption and separation. Here we devise a unique cation-exchange approach to tune the dynamic behavior of a flexible anionic framework, [Zn2(bptc)(datrz)]- (denoted as MAC-6, where H4bptc = [1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3',5,5'-tetracarboxylic acid and Hdatrz = 3,5-diamine-1H-1,2,4-triazole), so as to realize the tailorable gated adsorption. The CO2 adsorption amount at 273 K can be enhanced by exchanging the counterion of protonated dimethylamine (HDMA+) with tetraethylammonium (TEA+), tetrabutylammonium (TBA+), and tetramethylammonium (TMA+), where the adsorption behavior is transferred from nongated to gated adsorption. Interestingly, the Pgo for gate-opening adsorption can be further tuned from 442 to 331 mmHg by simply adjusting the ratio of HDMA+ and TMA+. The origin of this unique tunable property, as revealed by X-ray diffraction experiments and structure models, is rooted at the cation-responsive characteristic of this flexible framework.",28414452,2017,Cation-Exchange Approach to Tuning the Flexibility of a Metal-Organic Framework for Gated Adsorption.
865,"Coordination compounds built of trivalent lanthanide ions have been demonstrated as promising solid-state materials for diverse photoluminescent applications and as attractive magnetic objects with the prospective application in information storage and spintronics. We present a synthetic methodology in which both luminescent and magnetic functionalities are induced within lanthanide-based coordination polymers by the application of hexacyanocobaltate(III) anions and 3-hydroxypyridine (3-OHpy), both coordinated to 4f-metal ions modulating the lanthanide-centered properties. We report a series of trimetallic cyanido-bridged chains {[EuIIIxTbIII1-x(3-OHpy)2(H2O)4][CoIII(CN)6]}·H2O (x = 1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0; compounds 1, 2, ..., 7, 8). They reveal tunable visible photoluminescence ranging from green, through yellow and orange, to red color depending on the composition of material and the wavelength of UV excitation light. Such multicolored emission is realized by the adjusted ratio between red emissive Eu3+ and green emissive Tb3+ and by the selection of wavelengths of UV light controlling the intensities of Eu- and Tb-based components of visible luminescence. The photoluminescence is enhanced by the energy-transfer (ET) process from [CoIII(CN)6]3- and 3-OHpy to lanthanides, and the efficiencies of ET to Eu and Tb play an important role in the switchable emission. The whole family, 1-8, exhibits temperature-dependent paramagnetism due to the intrinsic property of lanthanide(3+) ions. Tb-containing 2-8 reveal the field-induced slow relaxation of magnetization due to the magnetic anisotropy of Tb3+. Moreover, the compounds built of large amounts of Tb reveal the double relaxation, the faster of a typical TbIII single-ion origin, and the slower originating from the magnetic dipole-magnetic dipole interactions between neighboring TbIII centers.

866,"Mothers' interactions with their young children have predicted later child development, behavior, and health, but evidence has been developed mainly in at-risk clinical samples. An economically and racially diverse sample of pregnant women who were not experiencing a high-risk pregnancy were recruited to participate in a community-based, longitudinal study of factors associated with child cognitive and social-emotional development during the first 3 years. The purpose of the present analysis was to identify associations between the characteristics of 1125 mothers and their 1-year-olds and the mothers' and children's scores on the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS). A multivariable approach was used to identify maternal and child characteristics associated with NCATS scores and to develop prediction models for NCATS total and subscale scores of mothers and children. Child expressive and receptive communication and maternal IQ, marital status, age, and insurance predicted NCATS Mother total score, accounting for 28% of the score variance. Child expressive communication and birth weight predicted the NCATS Child total score, accounting for 4% of variance. Child's expressive communication and mother's IQ and marital status predicted NCATS mother-child total scores. While these findings were similar to reports of NCATS scores in at-risk populations, no previous teams examined all of the mother and child characteristics included in this analysis. These findings support the utility of the NCATS for assessing mother-child interaction and predicting child outcomes in community-based, non-clinical populations. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",28419485,2017,Maternal and Child Characteristics Associated With Mother-Child Interaction in One-Year-Olds.
867,"The high-pressure behavior of technologically important visible-light photocatalytic semiconductor InNbO4, adopting a monoclinic wolframite-type structure at ambient conditions, was investigated using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopic measurements, and first-principles calculations. The experimental results indicate the occurrence of a pressure-induced isostructural phase transition in the studied compound beyond 10.8 GPa. The large volume collapse associated with the phase transition and the coexistence of two phases observed over a wide range of pressure shows the nature of transition to be first-order. There is an increase in the oxygen anion coordination number around In and Nb cations from six to eight at the phase transition. The ambient-pressure phase has been recovered on pressure release. The experimental pressure-volume data when fitted to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of states yields the value of ambient pressure bulk modulus as 179(2) and 231(4) GPa for the low- and high-pressure phases, respectively. The pressure dependence of the Raman mode frequencies and Grüneisen parameters was determined for both phases by experimental and theoretical methods. The same information is obtained for the infrared modes from first-principles calculations. Results from theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental findings.

R3+, Mn2+, and Mn3+ cations are ordered at the A site in two separate chains consisting of R3+ and alternating Mn2+ (in tetrahedral coordination) and Mn3+ (in square-planar coordination), while Mn3+ and mixed-valent Mn3+/Mn4+ are ordered at the B site in layers. The ordering can be represented as [R3+Mn2+0.5Mn3+0.5]A[Mn3+Mn3.5+]BO6. The triple cation ordering observed at the A site is very rare, and the layered double-B-site ordering is also scarce.

870,"INTRODUCTION
Teaching Psychology in medical curriculum has been the subject of numerous dissertations that focus on the relevance of this knowledge for doctors, at a general level.


METHODS
A non-systematic review of the relevant literature, particularly from the last decade, as well as national and international recommendations addressing the need for integration of behavioural and social sciences in medical training, was performed.


RESULTS
The literature supports the existence of preconceptions and negative attitudes towards the role of psychology in medical education, demonstrated by research in various european and american universities. The socio-cultural context, the different methodologies and barriers experienced by teachers in medical education are listed and provide the matrix for a more comprehensive discussion of the development of the doctor's identity.


CONCLUSION
Revisiting the experience of many years of teaching Medical Psychology, it is considered that the process of integration of this curricular area should occur horizontally and vertically throughout the course, stressing the need for the pedagogical training of teachers. Concepts that arise from personal reflection, adjusted to the reality of our education and the basic principles that guide it, are elaborated in order to integrate the teaching of Psychology in Medicine, emphasizing its importance and utility in the competencies and abilities of future doctors.",28425891,2016,"Teaching Psychology in Medicine: The Context, Methodologies and Doctor's Professional Identity."
871,"Two new lanthanide-based 3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), {[Ln(L)(Ox)(H2O)]n·xH2O} [Ln = Gd3+ and x = 3 (1) and Dy3+ and x = 1.5 (2); H2L = mucic acid; OxH2 = oxalic acid] showing interesting magnetic properties and channel-mediated proton conduction behavior, are presented here. Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis shows that, in complex 1, the overall structure originates from the mucate-bridged gadolinium-based rectangular metallocycles. The packing view reveals the presence the two types of hydrophilic 1D channels filled with lattice water molecules, which are strongly hydrogen-bonded with coordinated water along the a and b axes, whereas for complex 2, the 3D framework originates from a carboxylate-bridged dysprosium-based criss-cross-type secondary building block. Magnetic studies reveal that 1 exhibits a significant magnetic entropy change (-ΔSM) of 30.6 J kg-1 K-1 for ΔH= 7 T at 3 K. Our electronic structure calculations under the framework of density functional theory reveal that exchange interactions between Gd3+ ions are weak and of the antiferromagnetic type. Complex 2 shows field-induced single-molecule-magnetic behavior. Impedance analysis shows that the proton conductivity of both complexes reaches up to the maximum value of 4.7 × 10-4 S cm-1 for 1 and 9.06 × 10-5 S cm-1 for 2 at high temperature (>75 °C) and relative humidity (RH; 95%). The Monte Carlo simulations confirm the exact location of the adsorbed water molecules in the framework after humidification (RH = 95%) for 1. Further, the results from computational simulation also reveal that the presence of a more dense arrangement of adsorbed water molecules through hydrogen bonding in a particular type of channel (along the a axis) contributes more to the proton migration compared to the other channel (along the b axis) in the framework.",28426209,2017,Channel-Assisted Proton Conduction Behavior in Hydroxyl-Rich Lanthanide-Based Magnetic Metal-Organic Frameworks.
872,"Diffusion processes in social networks often cause the emergence of global phenomena from individual behavior within a society. The study of those global phenomena and the simulation of those diffusion processes frequently require a good model of the global network. However, survey data and data from online sources are often restricted to single social groups or features, such as age groups, single schools, companies, or interest groups. Hence, a modeling approach is required that extrapolates the locally restricted data to a global network model. We tackle this Missing Data Problem using Link-Prediction techniques from social network research, network generation techniques from the area of Social Simulation, as well as a combination of both. We found that techniques employing less information may be more adequate to solve this problem, especially when data granularity is an issue. We validated the network models created with our techniques on a number of real-world networks, investigating degree distributions as well as the likelihood of links given the geographical distance between two nodes.",28426826,2017,Link-prediction to tackle the boundary specification problem in social network surveys.
873,"Upon hearing a conspecific signal, animals must assess their relationship with the signaller and respond appropriately. Territorial animals usually respond more aggressively to strangers than neighbors in a phenomenon known as the ""dear enemy effect"". This phenomenon likely evolved because strangers represent a threat to an animal's territory tenure and parentage, whereas neighbors only represent a threat to an animal's parentage because they already possess a territory (providing territory boundaries are established and stable). Although the dear enemy effect has been widely documented using behavioral response variables, little research has been conducted on the physiological responses of animals to neighbors versus strangers. We sought to investigate whether the dear enemy effect is observed physiologically by exposing territorial male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to playback simulating a neighbor or a stranger, and then collecting blood samples to measure plasma testosterone levels. We predicted that song sparrows would exhibit increased testosterone levels after exposure to stranger playback compared to neighbor playback, due to the role testosterone plays in regulating aggression. Contrary to our prediction, we found that song sparrows had higher testosterone levels after exposure to neighbor playback compared to stranger playback. We discuss several explanations for our result, notably that corticosterone may regulate the dear enemy effect in male song sparrows and this may inhibit plasma testosterone. Future studies will benefit from examining corticosterone in addition to testosterone, to better understand the hormonal underpinnings of the dear enemy effect.",28434901,2017,Male song sparrows have elevated testosterone in response to neighbors versus strangers.

875,"Relationships between maternal education (ME) and both behavioral performances and brain activation during the discrimination of phonemic and nonphonemic sounds were examined using fMRI in children with different levels of phoneme categorization proficiency (CP). Significant relationships were found between ME and intellectual functioning and vocabulary, with a trend for phonological awareness. A significant interaction between CP and ME was seen for nonverbal reasoning abilities. In addition, fMRI analyses revealed a significant interaction between CP and ME for phonemic discrimination in left prefrontal cortex. Thus, ME was associated with differential patterns of both neuropsychological performance and brain activation contingent on the level of CP.

876,"The present study aimed to verify the efficacy of tranilast (TL) for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with the use of an experimental colitis model. The experimental colitis model was prepared by intrarectal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS; 40mg/kg) dissolved in water containing 25% ethanol. The pharmacological effects of TL after repeated oral administration were evaluated by biomarker and histological analyses, and the pharmacokinetic behavior of TL was also examined after single oral administration. The intrarectal instillation of TNBS solution caused colitis, as evidenced by ca. 2.2-, 5-, and 3-fold increases in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, infiltrated cell numbers, and the thickness of the submucosa in the colon, respectively. However, orally-taken TL (10mg/kg, twice a day for 9days) led to a 92% reduction in the increase of the MPO level by TNBS enema, and cellular infiltration and thickened submucosa in the experimental colitis model tended to also be suppressed by repeated oral administration of TL. The oral bioavailability of TL in TNBS-treated rats was calculated to be as low as ca. 6.5%, and the poor oral absorption of TL may be a limitation of the treatment for IBD. TL could attenuate TNBS-induced colitis on the basis of the obtained results, and the anti-inflammatory effects would have clinical relevance to the therapeutic outcomes of TL in IBD patients. Although further improvement in the oral bioavailability of TL might be required for better pharmacological outcomes, TL would be an efficacious agent for treating IBD.",28437888,2017,Protective effects of tranilast on experimental colitis in rats.
877,"OBJECTIVES
The present study was aimed to establish a model of chronic prostatitis in rat with the use of intraprostatic injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant, and to examine the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of melittin on the newly-developed chronic prostatic pain model.


METHODS
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) into the prostate. Twelve days after model rats of the treatment group were injected melittin into the prostate, while those of the control group received sterile saline injection. The nociceptive effects of CFA were evaluated by using a behavior approach (i.e. mechanical pain threshold measurement) on the day of CFA injection and 6, 12, and 18days after CFA injection. After the in-live study was done, the prostate was collected for histological examination of inflammatory cell infiltration. Levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in prostate and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in spinal cord were determined using immunohistochemistry. Rats of the sham control group received intraprostatic injection of sterile saline and were studied using the same methods RESULTS: Intraprostatic CFA injection induced local allodynia that lasted over at least 2 weeks. The pain behavior of rat was associated with increases in inflammatory cell infiltration into the prostate. Levels of COX-2 in prostate and GFAP in spinal cord were also elevated. Treatment with melittin significantly raised pain threshold, decreased inflammatory infiltrates, and suppressed COX-2 and GFAP expression.


CONCLUSION
Intraprostatic injection of CFA induced neurogenic prostatitis and prostatic pain. The established model will be useful to the study of CP/CPPS pathogenesis. Melittin demonstrated profound anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects on the chronic prostatic pain model, suggesting melittin may hold promise as a novel therapeutic for treatment of CP/CPPS.",28441718,2017,Therapeutic effect of melittin on a rat model of chronic prostatitis induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant.
878,"Tetrapyrrolic porphyrazine macrocycles with externally appended 2-pyridyl rings were synthesized and characterized as to their spectroscopic, electrochemical, and photophysical properties. The investigated compounds are represented as [Py8PzH2], the unmetalated octakis(2-pyridyl)porphyrazine, and the metal complexes [Py8PzM], where M is MgII(H2O), CuII, ZnII, or CoII. The spectroscopic properties and the electrochemical behavior of these compounds were examined in solution of polar (pyridine, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylformamide) and nondonor solvents (CHCl3, CH2Cl2), and the data were compared with those obtained from earlier studies on the related tetrapyrazinoporphyrazines, [Py8TPyzPzM], and the tetraquinoxalinoporphyrazines, [Py8QxPzM], also bearing externally 2-pyridyl rings, and characterized by a more extended central π-conjugated macrocyclic framework. The newly synthesized porphyrazines possess good solubility and are present in their monomeric form in all the examined solvents as shown by UV-visible spectra. The unmetalated species and metal derivatives undergo multiple one-electron reductions within the potential range of the nonaqueous examined solvents. The derivatives with nonredox active metal centers could accept four electrons on the conjugated macrocycle, while the CoII complex was characterized by a single one-electron oxidation and five reductions in DMSO. The photosensitizer activity for the generation of singlet oxygen was also examined for the MgII(H2O) and ZnII complexes in DMF, with measured ΦΔ values being, respectively, 0.42 and 0.64, this latter value indicating the ZnII species as being a promising material for use as anticancer agent in photodynamic therapy.",28443665,2017,"Octakis(2-pyridyl)porphyrazine and Its Neutral Metal Derivatives: UV-Visible Spectral, Electrochemical, and Photoactivity Studies."
879,"Angiogenesis is a dynamic hypoxia-stimulated process playing a key role in tissue growth and repair under various pathophysiological circumstances. Abnormal angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Oxytocin receptor is a classical G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on endothelial cells. The present study was aimed to investigate how oxytocin receptor regulated the angiogenic behaviors of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that oxytocin at 0.1μM significantly increased cell proliferation, upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of CD31 and vWF (two important endothelial markers), and enhanced the tuber formation capacity in HUVECs. However, oxytocin receptor inhibitor atosiban at 10μM significantly suppressed these angiogenic properties of HUVECs. Additionally, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) inhibitor PX-478 at 20μM also remarkably inhibited the angiogenic properties of HUVECs. We further found that atosiban at 10μM significantly repressed the promoter activity of HIF-1α and reduced the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α in HUVECs. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1α by PX-478 at 20μM abolished oxytocin-enhanced angiogenic properties of HUVECs. Finally, transcription factor Gli1 inhibitor GANT-58 at 5μM significantly abolished oxytocin-induced mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α, while the nuclear abundance of Gli1 was significantly reduced by atosiban at 10μM, but was increased by oxytocin at 0.1μM in HUVECs. GANT-58 at 5μM also significantly abolished oxytocin-enhanced angiogenic properties of HUVECs. Altogether, these discoveries suggested that oxytocin receptor signaling promoted the angiogenic behaviors of HUVECs via Gli1-indcued transcription of HIF-1α. We provided novel molecular insights into endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis.",28445928,2017,Regulation of angiogenic behaviors by oxytocin receptor through Gli1-indcued transcription of HIF-1α in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
880,"OBJECTIVES
Previous retrospective studies have shown that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) exerts salutary effect on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and nightmare distress. The relative magnitude of therapeutic benefits from CPAP and the strength of associations between duration of CPAP use and PTSD symptomatology are unknown.


METHODS
A prospective cohort design involving 47 combat veterans with PTSD and documented obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by overnight polysomnography. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, PTSD checklist-Military (PCL-M), Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ), and Nightmare Frequency Questionnaire (NFQ) were administered at baseline and 3 months after CPAP therapy. Objective adherence was assessed at the 3-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Twenty-two veterans with mild-to-moderate PTSD (PCL-M score 17-59) and 18 with severe-to-very-severe PTSD (PCL-M score 60-85) completed the study. There was a dose-dependent response of PCL-M to duration of CPAP usage (r = 0.45; p = 0.003). Veterans with severe-to-very-severe PTSD had a larger improvement in PTSD symptoms (d = 0.65; p = 0.004) compared with those with mild-to-moderate PTSD (d = 0.47; p = 0.04). CPAP usage was the only significant predictor of overall subjective improvement in PTSD symptoms (OR 10.5; p = 0.01). Significant changes in NDQ and NFQ scores following 3 months of treatment were observed in veterans adherent to CPAP, but the correlations with duration of CPAP use were not statistically significant (r = 0.24; p = 0.13 and r = 0.13; p = 0.4, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Improvement of PTSD symptoms in veterans with OSA was more pronounced with prolonged use of CPAP. Adherence to treatment was linked to abatement in nightmare distress and frequency. Future investigation of multimodal treatment, including behavioral intervention combined with CPAP, is warranted.",28449895,2017,The effect of continuous positive airway pressure on post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and obstructive sleep apnea: a prospective study.
881,"OBJECTIVES
To evaluate sleep consolidation and circadian activity rhythms in infants and toddlers with Down syndrome (DS) under light and socially entrained conditions within a familiar setting. Given previous human and animal data suggesting intact circadian regulation of melatonin across the day and night, it was hypothesized that behavioral indices of circadian rhythmicity would likewise be intact in the sample with DS.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study of 66 infants and young children with DS, aged 5-67 months, and 43 typically developing age-matched controls. Sleep and measures of circadian robustness or timing were quantified using continuous in-home actigraphy recordings performed over seven days. Circadian robustness was quantified via time series analysis of rest-activity patterns. Phase markers of circadian timing were calculated alongside these values. Sleep efficiency was also estimated based on the actigraphy recordings.


RESULTS
This study provided further evidence that general sleep quality is poor in infants and toddlers with DS, a population that has sleep apnea prevalence as high as 50% during the preschool years. Despite poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm and phase were preserved in children with DS and displayed similar developmental trajectories in cross-sectional comparisons with a typically developing (TD) cohort. In line with past work, lower sleep efficiency scores were quantified in the group with DS relative to TD children. Infants born with DS exhibited the worst sleep fragmentation; however, in both groups, sleep efficiency and consolidation increased across age. Three circadian phase markers showed that 35% of the recruitment sample with DS was phase-advanced to an earlier morning schedule, suggesting significant within-group variability in the timing of their daily activity rhythms.


CONCLUSIONS
Circadian rhythms of wake and sleep are robust in children born with DS. The present results suggest that sleep fragmentation and any resultant cognitive deficits are likely not confounded by corresponding deficits in circadian rhythms.",28449894,2017,"Young children with Down syndrome show normal development of circadian rhythms, but poor sleep efficiency: a cross-sectional study across the first 60 months of life."
882,"OBJECTIVES
We aimed to determine whether visual and automated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia (RSWA) methods could accurately diagnose patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).


METHODS
In iRBD patients (n = 15) and matched controls (n = 30) with and without OSA, we visually analyzed RSWA phasic burst durations, phasic, tonic, and ""any"" muscle activity by 3-s mini-epochs, phasic activity by 30-s (AASM rules) epochs, and automated REM atonia index (RAI). Group RSWA metrics were analyzed with regression models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the best diagnostic cutoff thresholds for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Both split-night and full-night polysomnographic studies were analyzed.


RESULTS
All mean RSWA phasic burst durations and muscle activities were higher in iRBD patients than in controls (p <0.01). Muscle activity (phasic, ""any"") cutoffs for 3-s mini-epoch scorings were as follows: submentalis (SM) (15.8%, 19.5%), anterior tibialis (AT) (29.7%, 29.7%), and combined SM/AT (39.5%, 39.5%). The tonic muscle activity cutoff was 0.70% and RAI (SM) cutoff 0.86. The phasic muscle burst duration cutoffs were 0.66 s for SM and 0.71 s for AT. Combining phasic burst durations with RSWA muscle activity improved the sensitivity and specificity of iRBD diagnosis.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence for quantitative RSWA diagnostic thresholds applicable in iRBD patients with OSA. Our findings in this study were very similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease-REM sleep behavior disorder (PD-RBD), consistent with a common mechanism and presumed underlying etiology of synucleinopathy in both groups.",28449901,2017,Diagnostic REM sleep muscle activity thresholds in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder with and without obstructive sleep apnea.

885,"Objective
To evaluate the registered trends and main causes of Infant Mortality (IM) in border areas of Colombia between 2005 and 2011.


Methodology
Ecological study in border areas, developed from the analysis of institutional information on IM and its causes, using the list of leading causes of death of infants and children by the WHO. For analysis, descriptive statistics and cluster analysis techniques were measured using Excel and the R-Project processing software.


Results
IM decreased steadily in the country and border areas between 2005 and 2011.The existence of significantly higher numbers in some of the municipalities studied was evident. Municipalities with lower IM had significantly higher average scores related to congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (conditions originated during the perinatal period), circulatory system diseases, digestive system diseases, and tumors and neoplasms. In contrast, municipalities with higher IM rates presented higher average scores related to endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and respiratory system diseases, many of them considered preventable.


Discussion
Border areas are affected by economic, political and cultural aspects that make them risk zones and generate interest for health. Findings reveal inequalities in the IM behavior when compared to the rest of the country.

886,"Objective 
To identify factors associated with loss to follow-up in Tuberculosis (TB) treatment, including patients' level of knowledge regarding treatment of this disease.


Methods
42 loss to follow-up cases and 84 control cases that were finishing the sixth month of their first treatment for tuberculosis were selected for this study. Primary data were gathered through interviews, while secondary data were obtained from the notification form of the disease, between December 2011 and April 2012. Factors associated with loss to follow-up were analyzed by means of a conditional logistic regression multivariate model for matched case-control groups.


Results
No significant differences were observed between loss to follow-up cases and controls regarding socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, clinical condition, treatment-related behaviors and the access of patients to sources of information on TB. In the regression multivariate analysis, significant associations with retreatment after loss to follow-up that were detected include: scarce knowledge on tuberculosis, lack of adherence to consultation during the current treatment, noncompliance with follow-up consultation deadline, smoking and HIV negative.


Conclusion
When compared to controls, cases undergoing TB retreatment after loss to follow-up have less knowledge on the disease, which is a sign for the professionals responsible for health education of the need to invest more time and efforts in activities that help the patient understand the disease and its treatment, as well as to have higher levels of adherence. In addition, noncompliance with the follow-up consultation deadline, failure to attend consultations during the current treatment and smoking are also factors that may be influenced by poor knowledge on the disease, which leads to the treatment loss to follow-up.",28453113,2016,Loss to follow-up in tuberculosis treatment and its relationship with patients' knowledge of the disease and other associated factors.

To characterize physical activity profiles in a rural community in the southwest of Colombia and to identify knowledge gaps on this issue in the country.


Methods 
Cross-sectional study conducted in a rural area in Puerto Caldas, Pereira, Risaralda. The population of the study was obtained by convenience sampling from people participating in the activities of the Second Multidisciplinary Camp for Research and Services (CUMIS, for its acronym in Spanish), which was organized by the Colombian Association of Medical Students' Scientific Societies (ASCEMCOL, for its acronym in Spanish). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used in order to measure and classify the physical activity behaviors of this population.


Results
Data from 100 subjects with a mean age of 43±18 years were collected. 6 % of the population did not perform any kind of physical activity, while 61 % performed vigorous physical activity. Men spent more time in doing vigorous and moderate physical activity than women did (p<0.05). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on physical activity were followed by 72.29 % (n=60) and 82.35 % (n=14) of the people with an age of 18 to64 and ≥65 years, respectively.


Conclusion
It is necessary to build up evidence regarding physical activity in rural areas in order to implement public policies that promote its practice in communities where socioeconomic and health inequities exist. Part of the population living in the community where the study was carried out does not follow the WHO recommendations on physical activity; therefore, the lack of public health interventions is highlighted.

890,"OBJECTIVE
Non-response to antidepressant treatment is a substantial problem in primary care, and many patients with depression require additional second-line treatments. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and patterns of antidepressant switching in the UK, and identify associated demographic and clinical factors.


METHOD
Cohort analysis of antidepressant prescribing data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a large, anonymised UK primary care database. The sample included 262,844 patients who initiated antidepressant therapy between 1 January 2005 and 31 June 2011.


RESULTS
9.3% of patients switched to a different antidepressant product, with most switches (60%) occurring within 8 weeks of the index date. The proportion switching was similar for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (9.3%, 9.8% and 9.2%, respectively). Most switches were to an SSRI (64.5%), and this was the preferred option regardless of initial antidepressant class. Factors predictive of switching included male gender, age, and history of self-harm and psychiatric illness.


CONCLUSION
Over one in every 11 patients who initiates antidepressant therapy will switch medication, suggesting that initial antidepressant treatment has been unsatisfactory. Evidence to guide choice of second-line treatment for individual patients is currently limited.

This descriptive study examines the acute physical and physiological demands of recreational team handball and evaluates whether it could be suggested as an exercise mode for fitness and health enhancement in 33-55-year-old untrained men. Time-motion, heart rate (HR), and blood lactate analyses were obtained from 4 recreational matches. Mean distance covered during the 60 min matches was 6012 ± 428 m. The players changed match activity 386 ± 70 times, of which high-intensity runs and unorthodox movements amounted to 59 ± 18 and 26 ± 26 per match, respectively. The most frequent highly demanding playing actions were jumps and throws. Match average and peak HR were 82 ± 6% and 93 ± 5%  HRmax, respectively.

892,"A series of trinuclear Ln3 complexes (LnIII = Yb (1), Er (2), Dy (3) and Gd (4)) were prepared from the tris-chelate bidentate ligand 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene (HAT). 1 and 2 exhibited field-induced single-molecule-magnet (SMM) behavior with estimated Ueff values of 21.30 and 13.86 K, respectively. Complex 3 behaved as a SMM even at zero field, and two different thermally assisted relaxation processes were detected with Ueff values of 29.6 K (fast relaxation process, FR) and 69 K (slow relaxation process, SR) due to the existence of two magnetically different DyIII centers in the molecule. Ab initio studies reveal that all the Dy3+ centers have almost an Ising ground state. The local anisotropy axes are not coplanar but form angles with the Dy3 plane in the range 58-78°. The magnetic interaction between the anisotropic Dy3+ ions is antiferromagnetic in nature and very weak in magnitude. However, due to the extreme feebleness of the magnetic interaction with regard to the local excitation energies, the magnetization blockade is most probably of single-ion origin. Calculations support the existence of two relaxation processes, which take place through the first excited state following an Orbach/Raman mechanism. Finally, for complex 4, the magnetocaloric effect was simulated using the magnetic parameters extracted from the fit of the magnetization and susceptibility data and demonstrated that the simulated -ΔSm values were almost coincident with those extracted from the integration of the field dependence of the magnetization.

893,"A new class of homoligated palladium(II) weak-link approach (WLA) complexes bearing hemilabile N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-thioether ligands is reported that, unlike previous tweezer-like WLA complexes, expand and contract in a linear fashion when switching between configurational states. These complexes can be chemically switched between a trans open state and a trans closed state via the addition or subsequent extraction of Cl-. These bis(NHC) complexes also display unusual isomerization behavior. For example, an NMR spectroscopic investigation into the solution-state configuration of the open complex reveals the presence of interconverting syn,trans and anti,trans isomers, and a kinetic study shows that the barrier is large enough to isolate, store, and study the anti,trans isomer at room temperature. Notably, the linker length between the NHC and thioether moieties can be tailored with additional -CH2- groups, which affords considerable control over the geometric changes imposed by switching. Therefore, this class of complexes may be useful in the construction of allosterically regulated supramolecular assemblies and materials.",28471640,2017,Palladium(II) Weak-Link Approach Complexes Bearing Hemilabile N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Thioether Ligands.
894,"Background
Despite the widespread use of opioids for the treatment of cancer pain, results from several surveys consistently show that pain is still prevalent in some patients with malignant diseases. The purinergic P2Y12 receptor is a primary site leading to microglial activation and hyperalgesic pain behaviors and is considered a key regulator in the prevention of the aggravation of clinical pain conditions. Genetic variability in the P2RY12 gene may contribute to individual differences in pain and opioid sensitivity.


Methods
We genotyped 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the P2RY12 gene and compared genotypes against pain measurements and opioid requirements in Japanese cancer pain patients (N = 90). The most promising SNP association with pain severity was validated by genotyping an additional postoperative pain patient cohort (N = 355).


Results
Five SNPs (rs3732765, rs9859538, rs17283010, rs11713504, and rs10935840) of the P2RY12 gene were significantly associated with cancer pain severity, although opioid requirements were comparable in each genotype of the five SNPs. The alleles of these SNPs represented one absolute linkage disequilibrium block of the P2RY12 gene. In the second association study of postoperative pain, subjects carrying the minor T allele of the rs3732765 SNP demonstrated more intense 24-hour postoperative pain compared with subjects not carrying this allele although total 24-hour postoperative opioid consumptions based on weight were comparable.


Conclusions
Polymorphisms of the P2RY12 gene may predict individual differences in both cancer and postoperative pain severity; this might be caused by functional alteration of nociceptive neurons through neuron-glia interaction.",28472364,2018,Association Between Polymorphisms in the Purinergic P2Y12 Receptor Gene and Severity of Both Cancer Pain and Postoperative Pain.
895,"Following a hypothesis developed in an earlier paper, here it is discussed how deviations of blood pH from the normal range (namely states of acidemia) together with high blood levels of free fatty acids (FFA) may offer a rationale for many important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by shaping a context for formation of fatty acid micelles and vesicles with an acidic core, which fuse with the endothelia, disrupt vital cell processes, and thereby may initiate atherosclerotic plaque formation. Acidemia may arise primarily from dysregulation of the systemic buffers that control blood pH, chronic diseases of kidneys and lungs, inappropriate diet, or may be induced by some common drugs.

896,"Salvia miltiorrhiza root (Danshen) is widely used in Asia for its cardiovascular benefits and contains both hydrophilic phenolic acids and lipophilic tanshinones, which are believed to be responsible for its therapeutic efficacy. This review summarized the effects of these bioactive components from S. miltiorrhiza roots on pharmacokinetics of comedicated drugs with mechanic insights regarding alterations of protein binding, enzyme activity, and transporter activity based on the published data stemming from both in vitro and in vivo human studies. In vitro studies indicated that cytochrome P450 (CYP450), carboxylesterase enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase, organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) and OAT3, and P-glycoprotein were the major targets involved in S. miltiorrhiza-drug interactions. Lipophilic tanshinones had much more potent inhibitory effects towards CYPs activities compared to hydrophilic phenolic acids, evidenced by much lower K values of the former. Clinical S. miltiorrhiza-drug interaction studies were mainly conducted using CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 probe substrates. In addition, the effects of coexisting components on the pharmacokinetic behaviors of those noted bioactive compounds were also included herein.",28473993,2017,Salvia miltiorrhiza Roots against Cardiovascular Disease: Consideration of Herb-Drug Interactions.
897,"Lithium preparations have been successfully used to treat bipolar disorder (BD), and remain the best established long-term treatment for the disorder. In fact, lithium is a cornerstone of treatment to minimize the risk of recurrences and improve inter-episodic symptomatology. We reviewed the available evidence for the use of lithium in the treatment of BD, including its efficacy, limitations, and potential benefits also in consideration of the different formulations available. We also overviewed salient comparative aspects regarding the long-term alternative use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics in BD patients. The available evidence indicates that BD patients should be treated primarily with lithium, combined in some cases with antipsychotics especially in acute treatments, and sometimes, because of intolerance or inefficacy of lithium, with anticonvulsants. The use of adjunctive antidepressants should be limited to episodes of breakthrough depression. Lithium should be offered to the majority of BD patients as initial treatment especially when suicide ideation or behavior is present with adequate information about its long-term benefits and its potential side effects. Many patients can tolerate lithium without concomitant use of antidepressants, which may worsen the course of the illness or antipsychotics, which may cause severe long-term side effects.",28477315,2017,Treatment of Bipolar Disorder in a Lifetime Perspective: Is Lithium Still the Best Choice?

The mechanics of these systems is strictly coupled with the water transport resulting in the peculiar behavior known as poroviscoelasticy. This can be considered as sum of the viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric network and the poroelastic behavior caused by the water movement within the hydrogel. In this work a 3D monophasic model able to depict the poroviscoelastic behavior of these systems, within the field of nonlinear solid mechanics, is developed. The mass and momentum balances equations, supported by constitutive equations from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and by initial and boundary conditions, is implemented through the weak formulation in a commercial FEM-based software.

899,"BACKGROUND
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been proposed as environmental risk factors for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The effects of these pollutants on brain structures potentially involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD are unknown.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PAHs on basal ganglia volumes and ADHD symptoms in school children.


METHODS
We conducted an imaging study in 242 children aged 8-12years, recruited through a set of representative schools of the city of Barcelona, Spain. Indoor and outdoor PAHs and benzo[a]pyrene (BPA) levels were assessed in the school environment, one year before the MRI assessment. Whole-brain volumes and basal ganglia volumes (caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen) were derived from structural MRI scans using automated tissue segmentation. ADHD symptoms (ADHD/DSM-IV Scales, American Psychiatric Association 2002) were reported by teachers, and inattentiveness was evaluated with standard error of hit reaction time in the attention network computer-based test.


RESULTS
Total PAHs and BPA were associated with caudate nucleus volume (CNV) (i.e., an interquartile range increase in BPA outdoor level (67pg/m3) and indoor level (76pg/m3) was significantly linked to a decrease in CNV (mm3) (β=-150.6, 95% CI [-259.1, -42.1], p=0.007, and β=-122.4, 95% CI [-232.9, -11.8], p=0.030 respectively) independently of intracranial volume, age, sex, maternal education and socioeconomic vulnerability index at home). ADHD symptoms and inattentiveness increased in children with higher exposure to BPA, but these associations were not statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to PAHs, and in particular to BPA, is associated with subclinical changes on the caudate nucleus, even below the legislated annual target levels established in the European Union. The behavioral consequences of this induced brain change were not identified in this study, but given the caudate nucleus involvement in many crucial cognitive and behavior processes, this volume reduction is concerning for the children's neurodevelopment.",28482185,2017,Effect of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on basal ganglia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in primary school children.
900,"The fabrication of differential pulse voltametry (DPV) sensor for the effective detection of Quercetin (QR) was achieved by modifying carbon paste electrode (CPE) with Iron decorated multi walled carbon nano tubes (Fe-MWCNTs) followed by drop casting of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide onto the surface for optimal results. Cyclic voltammetry and DPV techniques were used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of QR (Quercetin) respectively. The sensor revealed impressive electro-catalytic behavior towards oxidation of QR with almost 6.4 times increase in current compared to bare carbon paste electrode CPE and also decrease in the energetics. Under optimum conditions, a wide linear dynamic range of 0.06 to 3000μM, with a lower limit of detection, 1.20nM with S/N=3 was observed. Absence of peak for the interfering molecules such as Folic acid and Ascorbic acid makes it a unique sensor with significant analytical advantage. The quantification of QR at this sensor was not affected by the presence of 1000 fold Uric Acid implying that the sensor is capable of specifically identifying QR in a mixture of interfering molecules. In this paper, we demonstrate that with minimal use of modifiers and simple procedures of fabrication, the fabricated sensor exhibits excellent stability, reproducibility and swift responses. Application of the developed electrode was demonstrated by detecting QR in wine and coconut water samples with satisfactory recoveries.",28482479,2017,A novel and sensitive hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide functionalized Fe decorated MWCNTs modified carbon paste electrode for the selective determination of Quercetin.
901,"We have provided evidence that the beneficial effect of super-oxidized water (SOW) disinfected Ti6Al4V-TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) can reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. However, the need of antifungal nanostructured surfaces with osteoactive capabilities is an important goal that has been arising for dental implants (DI) applications. Thus, in the present study we isolated and tested the effects of Candida albicans (C. albicans) on disinfected, wetter and nanoroughness NTs compared to a non-modified control. Moreover, we elucidated part of the fungal adhesion mechanism by studying and relating the mycotic adhesion kinetics and the formation of fungal nanoadhesion bonds among the experimental materials, to gain new insight of the fungal-material-interface. Similarly, the initial behavior of human alveolar bone osteoblasts (HAOb) was microscopically evaluated. NTs significantly reduced the yeasts adhesion and viability with non-outcomes of biofilm than the non-modified surface. Cross-sectioning of the fungal cells revealed promoted nano-contact bonds with superior fungal spread on the control alloy interface; meanwhile NTs evidenced decreased tendency along time; suggesting, down-regulation by the nanostructured morphology and the SOW treatment. Importantly, the initial performance of HAOb demonstrated strikingly promoted anchorage with effects of filopodia formation and increased vital cell on NTs with SOW. The present study proposes SOW treatment as an active protocol for synthesis and disinfection of NTs with potent antifungal capability, acting in part by the reduction of nano-adhesion bonds at the surface-fungal interface; opening up a novel route for the investigation of mycotic-adhesion processes at the nanoscale for bone implants applications.",28482568,2017,Enhanced antifungal activity by disinfected titanium dioxide nanotubes via reduced nano-adhesion bonds.
902,"Three air-stable Co(II) mononuclear complexes with different aromatic substituents have been prepared and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The mononuclear complexes [Co(H2L1)2]·2THF (1), [Co(HL2)2] (2), and [Co(H2L3)2]·CH2Cl2 (3) (where H3L1, H2L2, and H3L3 represent 3-hydroxy-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (6-hydroxymethyl-pyridin-2-ylmethylene) hydrazide, nicotinic acid (6-hydroxymethyl-pyridin-2-ylmethylene) hydrazide, and 2-hydroxy-benzoic acid (6-hydroxymethyl-pyridin-2-ylmethylene) hydrazide, respectively) feature a distorted mer octahedral coordination geometry. Detailed magnetic studies of 1-3 have been conducted using direct and alternating current magnetic susceptibility data. Field-induced slow magnetic relaxation was observed for these three complexes. There are few examples of such behavior in (distorted) octahedral coordination geometry (OC) Co(II) mononuclear complexes with uniaxial anisotropy. Analysis of the six-coordinate Co(II) mononuclear single-ion magnets (SIMs) in the literature using the SHAPE program revealed that they all show what is best described as distorted trigonal prismatic (TRP) coordination geometry, and in general, these show negative D zero-field splitting (ZFS) values. On the other hand, all the Co(II) mononuclear complexes displaying what is best approximated as distorted octahedral (OC) coordination geometry show positive D values. In the new Co(II) mononuclear complexes we describe here, there is an ambiguity, since the rigid tridentate ligands confer what is best described for an octahedral complex as a mer coordination geometry, but the actual shape of the first coordination sphere is between octahedral and trigonal prismatic. The negative D values observed experimentally and supported by high-level electronic structure calculations are thus in line with a trigonal prismatic geometry. However, a consideration of the rhombicity as indicated by the E value of the ZFS in conjunction with the SHAPE analysis shows that in this case it is difficult to distinguish between the OC and TRP descriptions.",28485955,2017,Field-Induced Co(II) Single-Ion Magnets with mer-Directing Ligands but Ambiguous Coordination Geometry.

The intention is to put forward a cohesive model for the evolution of causal cognition in humans, which can be assessed against increasingly fine-grained empirical data from the palaeoanthropological and archaeological records. We propose that the tracking behaviour (i.e., the ability to interpret and follow external, inanimate, visual clues of hominins) provides a rich case study for tracing the evolution of causal cognition in our lineage. The grades of causal cognition are tentatively linked to aspects of the Stone Age/Palaeolithic archaeological record. Our model can also be applied to current work in evolutionary psychology and research on causal cognition, so that an inter-disciplinary understanding and correlation of processes becomes increasingly possible.",28489015,2017,Tracking the evolution of causal cognition in humans.
904,"The A-site ordered negative thermal expansion material LaCu3Fe4O12 (LaCFO) was comprehensively investigated by using first-principles calculations. A pressure-triggered crystal structural phase transition from space group Im3̅ (No. 204) to Pn3̅ (No. 201) and magnetic transformation from a G-type antiferromagnetic (G_AFM) ground state to ferrimagnetic (FerriM) coupling were observed in LaCFO via gradual compression of the equilibrium volume. Correspondingly, the Fe-Cu intersite charge transfer from Fe to Cu 3dxy orbital, expressed as 4Fe3+ + 3Cu3+ → 4Fe3.75+ + 3Cu2+, was simulated along with the magnetic phase transformation from the G_AFM configuration to the FerriM state. Intriguingly, the Fe charge disproportionation, formulated as 8Fe3.75+ → 5Fe3+ + 3Fe5+, appeared and was attributed to the strong hybridization between Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals in the FerriM state when the volumes were substantially compressed up to less than or equal to 80%V. Meanwhile, the external hydrostatic pressure also leads to a spin flip from a high-spin Fe3+ antiferromagnetically arranged LaCu3+3Fe3+4O12 Mott insulator at low pressure and goes through a FerriM LaCu2+3Fe3.75+4O12 half-metal to a low-spin FerriM coupled LaCu2+3Fe3+5/2Fe5+3/2O12 metal at high pressure. Therefore, the crossover from high spin to low spin is responsible for the charge disproportionation in LaCFO. Essentially, the charge transfer and spin flip originate from the discontinuous changes of metal-oxygen bond lengths and angles in the compressed atomic structure. Finally, the negative thermal expansion behavior and mechanism of LaCFO were theoretically examined and clearly revealed.",28489392,2017,"Theoretical Study on the Negative Thermal Expansion Perovskite LaCu3Fe4O12: Pressure-Triggered Transition of Magnetism, Charge, and Spin State."
905,"Zero in-plane thermal expansion (TE) in a two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer is demonstrated. The combination of components that expand and those that shrink into zigzag layers results in no net area change in the 2D materials with temperature. Single crystals of [Mn(salen)]2[Mn(N)(CN)4(guest)] (salen = N,N'-ethylenebis(salicylideneaminato), guest = MeOH and MeCN) were prepared, and variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray structural analyses demonstrated that these compounds exhibited both anisotropic positive and negative thermal expansion depending on the guest species. The TE behavior results from distortions of the octahedral coordination geometry of [Mn(salen)]+ units in the zigzag layers. When both guests MeOH and MeCN were incorporated into one material, [Mn(salen)]2[Mn(N)(CN)4(MeOH)0.25(MeCN)0.75], zero in-plane TE resulted in a range of temperature between 380 and 440 K.",28492319,2017,Zero in-Plane Thermal Expansion in Guest-Tunable 2D Coordination Polymers.
906,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is required for inflammatory nociceptive (pain) sensitization in Drosophila and vertebrates. Nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae following UV-induced tissue damage is accompanied by epidermal apoptosis and requires epidermal-derived TNF/Eiger and the initiator caspase, Dronc. Major gaps remain regarding TNF function in sensitization, including the relationship between apoptosis/tissue damage and TNF production, the downstream signaling in this context, and the target genes that modulate nociceptive behaviors. Here, apoptotic cell death and thermal nociceptive sensitization are genetically and procedurally separable in a Drosophila model of UV-induced nociceptive sensitization. Activation of epidermal Dronc induces TNF-dependent but effector caspase-independent nociceptive sensitization in the absence of UV. In addition, knockdown of Dronc attenuated nociceptive sensitization induced by full-length TNF/Eiger but not by a constitutively soluble form. UV irradiation induced TNF production in both in vitro and in vivo, but TNF secretion into hemolymph was not sufficient to induce thermal nociceptive sensitization. Downstream mediators of TNF-induced sensitization included two TNF receptor-associated factors, a p38 kinase, and the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B. Finally, sensory neuron-specific microarray analysis revealed downstream TNF target genes induced during thermal nociceptive sensitization. One of these, enhancer of zeste (E(z)), functions downstream of TNF during thermal nociceptive sensitization. Our findings suggest that an initiator caspase is involved in TNF processing/secretion during nociceptive sensitization, and that TNF activation leads to a specific downstream signaling cascade and gene transcription required for sensitization. These findings have implications for both the evolution of inflammatory caspase function following tissue damage signals and the action of TNF during sensitization in vertebrates.",28492538,2017,Drosophila caspase activity is required independently of apoptosis to produce active TNF/Eiger during nociceptive sensitization.
907,"Oral and cutaneous tissues are the most frequent origin in canine squamous cell carcinoma (SSC). In SCC, changes in adhesion molecule expression and transition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype are thought to be important in development of invasive behavior of neoplastic cells at the leading front of the tumor. We therefore investigated histological invasive front grading and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both oral SCCs and cutaneous SCCs. EMT was assessed by evaluating immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, desmoglein, vimentin, and N-cadherin. Regardless of the anatomic location, invasive front grading resulted in higher histological grades than grading of the surface. Most oral SCCs were of significantly higher histologic grade than cutaneous SCCs ( P < .01). Expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and desmoglein was significantly lower in oral SCC compared with cutaneous SCC ( P < .01). A significant association was found between invasive front grading and loss of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and desmoglein ( P < .01). Also, vimentin-positive neoplastic cells had low immunoreactivity of these adhesion molecules, and a few of these neoplastic cells were positive for N-cadherin. These results suggest not only E-cadherin and β-catenin but also desmoglein as markers for predicting biological behavior of canine SCC. Depending on their primary sites, EMT correlates with biological behavior and therefore histological grade of canine SCC. We suggest that combining invasive front grading with assessment of immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and desmoglein may allow more accurate prediction of biological behavior of canine SCCs.",28494700,2017,Invasive Front Grading and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Canine Oral and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas.

909,"In everyday life, moral decisions must frequently be made under acute stress. Although there is increasing evidence that both stress and cortisol affect moral judgment and behavior as well as decision-making in various domains unrelated to morality, surprisingly few attempts have been made to explore the effects of stress on everyday moral decision-making. Therefore, in the present study, we exposed 50 young healthy men to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) or its non-stressful placebo version (PTSST). We investigated the impact of acute stress exposure and stress-related cortisol levels on decision-making, decision certainty, and emotions in 28 everyday moral conflict situations with altruistic versus egoistic response alternatives. Results showed that the TSST-exposed group made more altruistic decisions than the non-stress control group, while groups did not differ in decision certainty and emotion ratings. Moreover, in correlational as well as regression analyses, additionally controlling for confounding variables, we observed significant positive associations between cortisol levels and altruistic decision-making. Further analyses revealed that altruistic decisions came along with significantly higher decision certainty and significantly more positive emotion ratings than egoistic decisions. Notably, our data also raise the idea that the personality trait agreeableness plays an important role in everyday moral decision-making. In sum, our findings provide initial evidence that both acute stress exposure and cortisol levels have prosocial effects on everyday moral decision-making in young healthy men.",28495558,2017,Acute psychosocial stress and everyday moral decision-making in young healthy men: The impact of cortisol.

We examined impact of intensive handwashing promotion on handwashing behavior of mothers of neonates. In Matlab, Bangladesh, we randomly allocated pregnant women at 28-32 weeks' gestation to intensive handwashing promotion or control. Behavior change communicators used a participatory approach to motivate maternal handwashing with soap and provided soap and handwashing stations. In the neonatal period, we observed soap and water at handwashing places and, at the end of the neonatal period, we estimated impact on maternal handwashing by structured observation. Among 253 women enrolled, intervention households were between 5.7 and 15.2 times as likely as control households to have soap and water present at the handwashing station in the baby's sleeping area. Intervention mothers washed hands with soap 4.1 times as frequently as controls (95% CI 2.55-6.59); handwashing with soap at recommended times was infrequent in both intervention (9%) and control (2%) groups. Intensively promoting handwashing with soap resulted in increased availability of soap and water at handwashing places, but only a modest increase in maternal handwashing with soap.

Here we investigate U(IV) aqueous speciation from pH 0 to 3 with the glycine (Gly) ligand, the smallest amino acid. We document evolution of the monomeric to the hexameric form from pH 0 to 3 via UV-vis spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Crystals of the hexamer [U6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(HGly)12]·12Cl-·12(H2O) (U6) were isolated at pH 2.15. The structure of U6 is a hexanuclear oxo/hydroxo cluster U6O4(OH)4 decorated by 12 glycine ligands and 6 water molecules. The effect of pH and temperature on U6 conversion to UO2 nanoparticles, or simply reversible aggregation, is detailed by transmission electron microscopy imaging, in addition to SAXS and UV-spectroscopy. Because of the zwitterion behavior of glycine, pH and temperature control over U(IV) speciation is complex. Unexpectedly, stability of the polynuclear cluster actually increases with increased pH.

The one-pot reactions of nickel perchlorate with the RBiIBTP-H2 proligands and an appropriate amount of carboxylic acid derivatives (CF3COOH or 4-X-C6H4CO2H; X = H, CF3, OMe) upon the addition of triethylamine in refluxing methanol (MeOH) afforded dinuclear nickel dicarboxylate complexes, which could be formulated as either [(RBiIBTP)Ni2(O2CCF3)2] (1 and 2) or [(RBiIBTP)Ni2(O2CC6H4-4-X)2] (3-7). The dinickel monobenzoate complexes [(RBiIBTP)Ni2(O2CPh)(ClO4)(H2O)] [R = 3C (8) and 5C (9)] were prepared by using a similar synthetic route in tetrahydrofuran under reflux with a ligand precursor to metal salt to benzoic acid ratio of 1:2:1 in the presence of NEt3. Recrystallization of neutral nickel perchlorate complex 8 in a saturated MeOH or ethanol (EtOH) solution gave ionic and alcohol-solvated monobenzoate bimetallic analogues [(3CBiIBTP)Ni2(O2CPh)(S)2]ClO4, where S = MeOH (10) and EtOH (11). Single-crystal X-ray crystallography of dinickel analogues 1-11 indicates that the BiIBTP scaffold performs as a N,O,N,N,O,N-hexadentate ligand to chelate two Ni atoms, and the ancillary carboxylate group adopts a bridging bidentate bonding mode. Catalysis for copolymerization of carbon dioxide (CO2) with cyclohexene oxide (CHO) by complexes 1-9 was systematically investigated, and the influence of carboxylate ligands on the catalytic behavior was also studied.

918,"The preparation and spectroscopic and structural characterization of three cobalt(II) complexes of formulas [Co(tppz)2](dca)2 (1), [Co(tppz)2][Co(NCS)4]·MeOH (2), and [Co(tppz)2][Co(NCO)4]·2H2O (3) [tppz = 2,3,5,6-tetrakis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine and dca = dicyanamide] are reported here. Compounds 1-3 have in common the presence of the cationic [Co(tppz)2]2+ entity where each mer-tridentate tppz ligand coordinates to the cobalt(II) ion equatorially through two pyridyl donors and axially via the pyrazine, completing the six-coordination. The electroneutrality is achieved by the organic dca group (1) and the anionic tetrakis(thiocyanato-κN)cobaltate(II) (2) and tetrakis(cyanato-κN)cobaltate(II) (3) complexes. Direct current (dc) magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1 in the temperature range 1.9-400 K show the occurrence of a thermally induced spin crossover behavior of the [Co(tppz)2]2+ unit from a high spin (S = 3/2) at higher temperatures to a low-spin (S = 1/2) at lower temperatures, with the low spin phase being reached at T ≤ 200 K. X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements in solution at low temperatures were used to characterize the low spin state. An analytical expression based on the combination of the spin-orbit coupling and both first- and second-order Zeeman effects for a d7 electronic configuration was used to fit the magnetic data of 1, the values of the best-fit parameters being Cvib = 0.1367(9), λ = -168(2) cm-1, α = 1.12(1), Δ = 1626(15) cm-1, and gLS = 2.12(1). The magnetic behavior of the four-coordinate cobalt(II) ions [Co(NCS)4]2- (2) and [Co(NCO)4]2- (3) with a 4A2 ground state overlaps with the spin crossover of the [Co(tppz)2]2+ entity, the abrupt decrease of the χMT product below 15.0 K being due to zero-field splitting effects between the spin components |±1/2> and |±3/2>. The combined analysis of the dc magnetic data and the Q-band EPR spectra in the solid state of 2 and 3 led to the following sets of best-fit parameters: Cvib = 0.105(5), λ = -170(4) cm-1, α = 1.10(2), Δ = 1700(25) cm-1, gLS = 2.10(1), gHS = 2.27(1), and |D| = 3.80(2) cm-1 (2) and Cvib = 0.100(1), λ = -169(5) cm-1, α = 1.10(3), Δ = 1500(30) cm-1, gLS = 2.10(1), gHS = 2.28(1), and |D| = 4.30(2) cm-1 (3). Some evidence of slowing of the relaxation of the magnetization has been found in the out-of-phase ac signal at very low temperatures under applied dc fields of 0.1-0.4 T for 3, suggesting the occurrence of single-ion magnet behavior of its [Co(NCO)4]2- anionic entity.",28530402,2017,Spin Crossover in Double Salts Containing Six- and Four-Coordinate Cobalt(II) Ions.

The basic structural components of these complexes are the [CuII(valdmpn)LnIII] units with a compartmental Schiff-base ligand. These [CuIILnIII] units were then further connected by the end-on (EO) azides between the Ln3+ centers to form tetranuclear {[CuLn](μ-N3)n[LnCu]} motifs, where n is 3 for the complexes of larger radii lanthanides (1CuLa to 5CuSm) and 2 for the complexes of smaller radii lanthanides (6CuEu to 14CuLu). While compounds 6CuEu to 14CuLu remain isolated tetranuclear clusters, compounds 1CuLa to 5CuSm are one-dimensional chains where tetranuclear motifs are further connected by end-to-end (EE) azides between CuII and LnIII centers. Direct current (dc) magnetic susceptibilities have been measured in the range of 1.8-300 K for all complexes, revealing the different nature of magnetic interactions between the spin centers. Among them, dominant ferromagnetic interactions were found in compounds 7CuGd, 8CuTb and 9CuDy. Alternating current (ac) magnetic measurements performed on 8CuTb, 9CuDy, and 10CuHo demonstrated the presence of slow magnetic relaxation under zero applied dc field. The spin relaxation barrier Ueff was determined to be 19.54 cm-1 (28.12 K) and 10.34 cm-1 (14.87 K) for compounds 8CuTb and 9CuDy. The SMM behavior of 8CuTb was further confirmed by the presence of magnetic hysteresis loops; while no hysteresis loop was observed for 9CuDy and 10CuHo.

The magnetic behaviors of the two compounds are investigated by means of magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements.

921,"The resistance to thermal quenching is an essential factor in evaluating the performance of luminescent materials for application in white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). In this work, we studied the site occupancy preference and thermal quenching of luminescence in β-Ca2P2O7:Bi2+ red phosphor at low (10-300 K) and high temperatures (303-573 K). In β-Ca2P2O7, the host lattice has four different calcium sites, at which Bi2+dopant can be located. After comparing the change of bond energy when the Bi2+ ions are incorporated into the four calcium sites, we found out that Bi2+ would preferentially occupy the smaller energy variation sites Ci(2) and Ci(1) in this compound, which can be assigned to Bi(2) and Bi(1), respectively. Surprisingly, we noticed that the variation of emission intensity is different under different excitations when the temperature changes from 10 to 300 K. When exciting into the typical absorption of Bi(1) sites at 419 nm, the emission intensity at 300 K remains only 38% as compared to that at 10 K, while exciting into typical Bi(2) absorption at 460 nm, the emission intensity increases to 110%. When further increasing the temperature from 303 to 573 K, we observed a similar phenomenon, and the emission at 460 nm excitation starts to quench at 453 K. The emission intensity at 573 K still remains 86.1% of that at 303 K. This might be attributed to the Bi(2) → Bi(1) energy transfer. It is also evidenced by the time-resolved emission spectra and lifetime values. This work gives new insights into better understanding luminescent behaviors of Bi2+-doped materials with multiple cation sites. This should be helpful in the future when designing the bismuth doped phosphor for WLEDs with better resistance to thermal quenching.",28537713,2017,Site Occupancy Preference and Antithermal Quenching of the Bi2+ Deep Red Emission in β-Ca2P2O7:Bi2.

Herein, we report a facile synthesis of CuO microspheres composed of ultrathin, single-crystal-like nanosheets via a simple solution method. The as-obtained CuO microspheres can serve as an active and stable water oxidation catalyst under electrochemical reaction conditions, owing to their unique structural features. In electrochemical water oxidation, this catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (a value related to practical relevance) at an overpotential of ∼0.48 V. Pure CuO was reported as a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) from near-neutral conditions to alkalescent conditions.

923,"Knowledge is known to affect self-care behaviors. However, little is known about the factors that influence self-care behaviors among patients with heart failure in Jordan. A cross-sectional descriptive-correlational design was used to describe the associations between knowledge, sociodemographics, and self-care behaviors. In a convenience sample of 226 patients with heart failure, the Dutch Heart Failure Scale and Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) version 6.2 were used to measure knowledge and self-care behaviors, respectively. The mean heart failure knowledge score was quite low at 5.29. The SCHFI self-care management subscale mean was 57.56 with an actual range of 10-90, and the SCHFI self-care maintenance subscale mean was 53.89 with an actual range of 13.33-86.66. The SCHFI self-care confidence subscale mean was lowest of the three at 45.07, with an actual range of 5.56-94.52. All three subscale mean scores were below the clinical target level (≥70) for the SCHFI. Lower knowledge, income, and educational level, shorter duration of disease, fewer people living at home, older age, and being unemployed were significant predictors of low self-care scores. Characteristics of the cultural, social, and healthcare environment in Jordan may help explain some results. Nurses may play a role in improving knowledge and self-care among patients with heart failure in Jordan.

924,"Based on two fluoro-substituted phenylacetate isomers, o-fluorophenylacetic acid (o-Hfpa) and p-fluorophenylacetic acid (p-Hfpa), two new Cu(ii)-azido compounds, [Cu(o-fpa)(N3)(C2H5OH)]n (1) and [Cu(p-fpa)(N3)(C2H5OH)]n (2), have been prepared, and structurally and magnetically characterized. Single-crystal structure analyses indicate that compounds 1 and 2 consist of 1D chain-like coordination networks in which adjacent copper cations are linked by the alternating triple-bridges of μ-1,1-azido, syn,syn-carboxylate and μ2-ethanol. For the two title compounds, the diverse charge distributions on the carboxyl groups caused by distinct substituent effects of the two phenylacetate coligands lead to the different structural parameters of intrachain Cu-Cu distances (3.218 Å for 1 and 3.168 Å for 2) and Cu-N-Cu angles (106.82° for 1 and 104.81° for 2), further resulting in the disparity of magnetic behaviors. The dominant ferromagnetic couplings between neighbouring Cu(ii) ions in the two compounds (J = 87.08 cm-1 for 1, J = 66.05 cm-1 for 2) are due to the counter-complementarity of the multiple superexchange pathways, contributing to the interesting plots of a ferromagnetic order (Tc = 11.0 K for 1, 9.5 K for 2) and slow magnetic relaxation that are rarely observed in most of the reported azido-Cu(ii) architectures. Heat-capacity experiments further emphasize the characteristic long-range ferromagnetic ordering in compounds 1 and 2. Magneto-structural relationships of 1 and 2 are investigated as well. Moreover, DFT calculations (using different methods and basis sets) have been performed on both compounds to provide a qualitative and quantitative theoretical explanation of their magnetic behavior.",28574547,2017,A substituent effect of phenylacetic acid coligand perturbed structures and magnetic properties observed in two triple-bridged azido-Cu(ii) chain compounds with ferromagnetic ordering and slow magnetic relaxation.

Here we aim to demonstrate that one so far barely considered reason is the monitoring of sensory action feedback, which detracts from processing of other concurrent tasks. To demonstrate this, we engaged participants in a psychological refractory period paradigm. The responses in the two tasks produced visual action effects. These effects occurred either immediately or they were delayed for the first of the two responses. We assumed that delaying these effects would engage a process of monitoring visual feedback longer, and delay a concurrent task more, as compared to immediate effects. This prediction was confirmed in two experiments.

Seabirds forage at fishing vessels, which has potentially deleterious effects for their population, but the extent of overlap and behavior in relation to ships is poorly known. Using novel biologging devices, which detect radar emissions and record the position of boats and seabirds, we measured the true extent of the overlap between seabirds and fishing vessels and generated estimates of the intensity of fishing and distribution of vessels in international waters. During breeding, wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) from the Crozet Islands patrolled an area of over 10 million km2 at distances up to 2500 km from the colony. Up to 79.5% of loggers attached to birds detected vessels. The extent of overlap between albatrosses and fisheries has widespread implications for bycatch risk in seabirds and reveals the areas of intense fishing throughout the ocean. We suggest that seabirds equipped with radar detectors are excellent monitors of the presence of vessels in the Southern Ocean and offer a new way to monitor the presence of illegal fisheries and to better understand the impact of fisheries on seabirds.",28598528,2018,Use of radar detectors to track attendance of albatrosses at fishing vessels.

Structure analysis revealed that JUMP-2 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/n and displays a two-dimensional (2D) network, which by topological analysis was characterized as a layered 3-connected hcb net. The topological analysis of MIL-144 revealed a 3,6-connected net with 3,6T80 topology.

The organic cations in both frameworks could successfully be exchanged with inorganic cations under retention of the respective network structure. In the process of exchange, both compounds displayed cation selectivity based on which solvent was utilized for immersing the solids.

In the present work, the organometallic complex ferrocene was used as a sensitizer for a titanium-oxo cluster. A ferrocenecarboxylate-substituted titanium-oxo cluster [Ti6(μ3-O)6(OiPr)6(O2CFc)6] (Fc = ferrocenyl) was synthesized and structurally characterized, in which the ferrocene wheel performs as a sensitizer for photocurrent response. For comparison, naphthalene-sensitized titanium-oxo clusters [Ti6(μ3-O)6(OiPr)6(NA)6] (NA = 1-naphthoate) and [Ti6(μ3-O)6(OiPr)6(NAA)6] (NAA = 1-naphthylacetate) with the same {Ti6} core structure were also synthesized. The structures, optical behaviors, electronic states and photoelectrochemical properties of these sensitized {Ti6} clusters were investigated. It is demonstrated that the introduction of ferrocene groups into the titanium-oxo cluster significantly reduces the band gap and enhances the photocurrent response in comparison with the naphthalene-sensitized clusters. The substantially reduced band gap of the ferrocene-sensitized cluster was attributed to the introduction of Fe(ii) d-d transitions and the possible contribution from the Fc → {Ti6} charge transfer. For the naphthalene-sensitized clusters, the better electronic coupling between the dye and the {Ti6} core in the 1-naphthoate (NA) substituted cluster results in higher photoelectrochemical activity.",28604913,2017,A ferrocenecarboxylate-functionalized titanium-oxo-cluster: the ferrocene wheel as a sensitizer for photocurrent response.
930,"BACKGROUND
The high rate of attrition along the care cascade of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in lost opportunities to provide timely antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to prevent unnecessarily high mortality. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a structural intervention, the one-stop (""One4All"") strategy that streamlines China's HIV care cascade with the intent to improve testing completeness, ART initiation, viral suppression, and mortality.


METHOD
A two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial was implemented in twelve county hospitals in Guangxi China to test the effectiveness of the One4All strategy (intervention arm) compared to the current standard of care (SOC; control arm). The twelve study hospitals were selected for homogeneity and allocated one-to-one to the intervention and control arms. All patients screening HIV positive in study hospitals were enrolled. Target study enrollment was 180 participants per arm, 30 participants per hospital. Basic demographic information was collected as well as HIV risk behavior and route of infection. In intervention hospitals, patients then went on to receive point-of-care CD4 testing and in-parallel viral load (VL) testing whereas patients in control hospitals progressed through the usual SOC cascade. The primary outcome measure was testing completeness within 30 days of positive initial HIV screening result. Testing completeness was defined as receipt of all tests, test results, and post-test counseling. The secondary outcome measure was ART initiation (receipt of first ART prescriptions) within 90 days of positive initial HIV screening result. Tertiary outcome measures were viral suppression (≤200 copies/mL) and all-cause mortality at 12 months.


DISCUSSION
We expect that this first-ever, cluster-randomized controlled trial of a bundle of interventions intended to streamline the HIV care cascade in China (the One4All strategy) will provide strong evidence for the benefit of accelerating diagnosis, thorough clinical assessment, and ART initiation via an optimized HIV care cascade. We furthermore anticipate that this evidence will be valuable to policymakers looking to elevate China's overall HIV/AIDS response to meet the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets and the broader, global goal of eradication of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

932,"Based on ligands dfppyH and pidpyH, cyclometalated Ir(iii) complexes [Ir(dfppy)2(pidpyH)](PF6) (1·PF6) and [Ir(dfppy)2(pidpy)] (2) have been synthesized. The crystal structures indicate that each {Ir(dfppy)2}+ unit is coordinated by a neutral ligand pidpyH in 1·PF6, while by a pidpy- anion in 2. The packing structure of 1·PF6 only exhibits electrostatic interactions and van der Waals interactions among [Ir(dfppy)2(pidpyH)]+ cations and PF6- ions. In contrast, the neighboring molecules in 2 are linked into a supramolecular chain structure through aromatic stacking interactions between two dfppy- ligands. In solution, 1·PF6 and 2 show acid/base-induced structural transformation due to the protonation/deprotonation of their pyridyl groups and/or imidazole units, which can be confirmed by their 1H NMR spectra. At room temperature, compounds 1·PF6, 2 and pidpyH in CH2Cl2 reveal TFA-induced luminescence switching behaviors, from a non-luminescence state to a luminescence state with an emission at 582 nm for both 1·PF6 and 2, and emission switching from 392 nm to 502 nm for pidpyH. These switching behaviors are associated with the protonation of pyridyl groups and/or imidazole units in 1·PF6, 2 and pidpyH. Moreover, compounds 1·PF6 and 2 were used as photosensitizers (PS) for reduction of water to hydrogen under the same experimental conditions.

Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that complexes 1 and 2 exhibit significant single-molecule magnet (SMM) behaviors.

934,"OBJECTIVES
Difficult breastfeeding in the first weeks after birth may result in muscle tension in infants and activation of the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Our primary objective was to examine the feasibility of collecting neuroendocrine markers of maternal HPA axis and SNS activation (salivary cortisol and α-amylase [sAA]) and electromyographic (EMG) markers of infant distress during feeding in the first 2 weeks after birth. We also examined the relationships of these indices to each other and to mother-infant interactive behaviors during feeding.


METHODS
We recruited mothers in the postpartum unit of a teaching hospital and observed a feeding in the dyad's home. Cortisol and sAA were sampled before feeding, 10 min into feeding, at feeding end, and 20 min after feeding. Infant muscle activity was recorded continuously with an EMG data logger. We used the Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale to measure mother-infant interaction.


RESULTS
The 20 mothers reported no disruption to breastfeeding and no change in infant behavior due to collection measures. Mean cortisol levels decreased significantly; there was no significant change in sAA levels. Relationships were found between interactive behavior and trends in neuroendocrine biomarkers. Longer bursts of infant muscle activity were associated with higher levels of maternal cortisol during feeding but not mother-infant interactive behaviors.

Maternal salivary biomarkers and their association with feeding behaviors can be a useful tool for clinical longitudinal research beginning soon after birth.

935,"OBJECTIVE
The frequency of mind-wandering (MW) decreases as a function of age in healthy individuals. One possible explanation is that MW is a resource-dependent process, and cognitive resources decline with age. The present study provides the first investigation of MW in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to further examine the resource model and discontinuities between healthy aging and AD.


METHOD
Three large cohorts completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART): a healthy middle-aged group (mean age = 61.79 ± 5.84 years; N = 270), a healthy older adult group (mean age = 76.58 ± 5.27 years; N = 282), and a group with early stage AD (mean age = 76.08 ± 7.17; N = 77), comparable in age to the second group.


RESULTS
Self-reports of MW during the SART decreased as a function of age, and there was a further decrease in the AD group. All 3 groups produced faster responses on trials before No-Go errors, suggesting MW occurred in all cohorts. After No-Go errors, healthy older adults slowed disproportionately compared with middle-aged adults. This was not evident in AD individuals who showed posterror slowing comparable with that in the middle-aged group.


CONCLUSIONS
The decreased self-reported MW in older adults and the further decline in AD are consistent with the cognitive resource account of MW. Behavioral indices suggest that AD is on a continuum with healthy aging, with the exception of posterror slowing that may suggest performance monitoring deficits in early AD individuals (e.g., lack of error awareness).

936,"This study employed a multifaceted model assessment approach to investigate the dimensionality and nomological network of a popular measure of trait reactance, the Hong Psychological Reactance Scale (HPRS; Hong & Page, 1989 ). To address confusion regarding the scoring and modeling of the HPRS as well as its limited external validity evidence, we tested competing factor models, diagnosed model-data misfit, examined relationships between competing factor models and key personality traits, and cross-validated the results. Confirmatory factor analytic results supported modeling the HPRS via a bifactor model and, when this model was applied, trait reactance was negatively related to agreeableness, conscientiousness, and conformity, and positively related to entitlement, as expected. However, we also demonstrated the consequences of championing a 1-factor model by highlighting differences in relationships with external variables. Specifically, although modeling the HPRS scores with the bifactor model resulted in greater model-data fit than the 1-factor model, relationships with external variables based on the 2 models differed negligibly.

937,"Emotional intelligence (EI) is a popular construct with concentrated areas of application in education and health contexts. There is a need for reliable and valid measurement of EI in young people, with brief yet sensitive measures of the construct preferable for use in time-limited settings. However, the proliferation of EI measures has often outpaced rigorous psychometric evaluation (Gignac, 2009 ). Using data from 849 adolescents (407 females, 422 males) aged 11 to 16 years (M age 13.4, SD = 1.2 years), this article systematically examines the structural and predictive properties of a frequently employed measure of adolescent trait EI-the Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version-Short Form (EQ-i:YV[S]); Bar-On & Parker, 2000 ). Although the intended multidimensional factor structure was recovered through confirmatory factor analysis, the statistical and conceptual coherency of the underlying model was inadequate. Using a multitrait-multimethod approach, the EQ-i:YV(S) was found to converge with other measures of EI; however, evidence for divergent validity (Big Five personality dimensions) was less robust. Predictive utility for adolescent mental health outcomes (depression, disruptive behavior) was also limited. Findings suggest that use of the EQ-i:YV(S) for predictive or evaluative purposes should be avoided until refinements to the scale are made.",28631978,2018,Structural and Predictive Properties of the Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version-Short Form (EQ-i:YV[S]).
938,"Medical students often experience professionalism dilemmas (which differ from ethical dilemmas) wherein students sometimes witness and/or participate in patient safety, dignity, and consent lapses. When faced with such dilemmas, students make moral decisions. If students' action (or inaction) runs counter to their perceived moral values-often due to organizational constraints or power hierarchies-they can suffer moral distress, burnout, or a desire to leave the profession. If moral transgressions are rationalized as being for the greater good, moral distress can decrease as dilemmas are experienced more frequently (habituation); if no learner benefit is seen, distress can increase with greater exposure to dilemmas (disturbance). We suggest how medical educators can support students' understandings of ethical dilemmas and facilitate their habits of enacting professionalism: by modeling appropriate resistance behaviors.",28644786,2017,Antecedents and Consequences of Medical Students' Moral Decision Making during Professionalism Dilemmas.

It discusses three common, problematic situations in which assumptions about culture may mask more complex problems concerning family dynamics, structural barriers to health care access, or implicit bias.

941,"The photocatalytic decomposition of nitrogen monoxide (NO) was achieved for the first time using Si-based nanomaterials. Nanocomposite powders composed of Si nanoflakes and metallic particles (Ni and Ni3Si) were synthesized using a simple one-pot reaction of layered CaSi2 and NiCl2. The synthesized nanocomposites have a wide optical absorption band from the visible to the ultraviolet. Under the assumption of a direct transition, the photoabsorption behavior is well described and an absorption edge of ca. 1.8 eV is indicated. Conventional Si and SiO powders with indirect absorption edges of 1.1 and 1.4 eV, respectively, exhibit considerably low photocatalytic activities for NO decomposition. In contrast, the synthesized nanocomposites exhibited photocatalytic activities under irradiation with light at wavelengths >290 nm (<4.28 eV).

942,"BaFe12-xGaxO19 (x ≤ 1.2) hexaferrites were synthesized via the usual ceramic technology. It has been established that with an increase in x, the unit cell and magnetic parameters monotonically decrease. The frequency of natural ferromagnetic resonance firstly decreases from 49.6 GHz down to 49.1 GHz when x = 0.6, and then it increases up to 50.5 GHz. The line width monotonically increases from 3.5 GHz up to 5 GHz. The peak amplitude of the resonant curve changes slightly with the exception of when x = 0.9, when it reaches -16 dB. The 1.3 GHz kOe-1 frequency shift in the bias field is more intensive for small values, when x = 0.3. The decreasing values of the magnetic parameters are a result of the dilution of Fe3+-O2--Fe3+ superexchange interactions. The behavior of the amplitude-frequency characteristics is largely determined through the reduction of uniaxial exchange anisotropy.

943,"Stressors often contribute to difficulties in maintaining behavior change following a period of abstinence, and may play a significant role in drug relapse. The activation of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) systems in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates many consequences of chronic stressor exposure. Here we ask whether PACAP is also involved in producing reinstatement in a model of stress-induced relapse to drug taking. Rats self-administered cocaine for 1 h daily over 10 days that was followed by 20 days of extinction training in which lever pressing no longer produced cocaine. In experiment 1, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed at several stages to determine transcript levels of PACAP and corresponding receptors. Reinstatement of cocaine seeking was then tested after footshock exposure in different groups of rats that were pretreated with vehicle solution, a PAC1 receptor antagonist (experiment 2), or a PACAP agonist (experiment 3) without footshock. In experiment 1, cocaine self-administration increased BNST PACAP transcript levels similar to what we have previously reported with chronic stress. In experiment 2, intra-BNST infusions of the PAC1/VPAC2 antagonist, PACAP 6-38, prevented footshock-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking. In experiment 3, intra-BNST PACAP infusion reinstated previously extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in the absence of footshock. Cocaine self-administration elevated BNST PACAP, and BNST PACAP receptor activation was necessary and sufficient for stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These data suggest that BNST PACAP systems may be viable targets for relapse prevention.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 26 July 2017; doi:10.1038/npp.2017.135.",28656976,2017,Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Peptide in the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis Mediates Stress-Induced Reinstatement of Cocaine Seeking in Rats.
944,"Sustained retention in HIV medical care is a key health behavior for the long-term health of people living with HIV (PLWH). Approximately 60% of PLWH in the U.S. are poorly retained in HIV care, yet to date, the few available evidence-based retention-promoting interventions are resource and time intensive to implement. The current study describes the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based retention-promoting intervention designed to meet the needs of a busy clinical care setting. 60 Minutes for Health reflects a low-resource single-session intervention, implemented by a health educator, to PLWH who have had a recent gap in care (≥6-months) in the past 18-months. Intervention content was informed by a situated application of the Information Motivation Behavioral Skills Model and delivered using a Motivational Interviewing-based format. The intervention uses a workbook to guide a series of activities that: (1) Identify and reduce misinformation guiding HIV care attendance. (2) Enhance motivation to maintain care via personal health goals. (3) Build skills for coping with emotional distress related to living with HIV. (4) Increase self-efficacy for navigating the logistics of maintaining care amidst competing priorities. A small feasibility pilot of this intervention protocol was conducted to assess its potential to improve retention in care and to obtain estimates for a larger-scale efficacy trial. Participants were randomized to the 60-minute intervention session (n = 8), or a theory-based time-and-attention control session focused on diet and nutrition (n = 8). Medical records were abstracted to evaluate changes in participants' retention in care status at 12- and 24-months post-intervention. Findings suggest the intervention is both feasible and acceptable to implement with poorly retained PLWH in a clinic setting. Post-intervention a larger proportion of intervention participants were retained in care (12-months: 87.5%, 24-months: 62.5%), compared control participants (12-months: 50.0%, 24-months: 25.0%). Future work should aim to evaluate a larger-scale efficacy trial.",28657333,2018,60 Minutes for health: examining the feasibility and acceptability of a low-resource behavioral intervention designed to promote retention in HIV care.
945,"We herein report the syntheses, structures, and magnetic properties of two isostructural two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers based on a pentagonal bipyramidal CoII unit [Co(TODA)]2+ and two hexacyanometallates, namely [MIII(CN)6]2[CoII(TODA)]3·9H2O (M = Cr (1), Co (2), TODA = 1,4,10-trioxa-7,13-diazacyclopentadecane). Structure analyses show that both complexes have 2D honeycomb structures where the [Co(TODA)]2+ units are bridged by the [MIII(CN)6]3- groups through three cyano groups in the facial positions. Magnetic investigation reveals ferromagnetic coupling between the CrIII and CoII centres through cyanides in 1. Due to the antiferromagnetic interaction between the layers, compound 1 exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering below 11.4 K, and shows a metamagnetic phase transition under an external dc field. Due to the disorder of the TODA ligands, compound 1 shows a spin glass behavior, which leads to slow magnetic relaxation in 1. A butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop at 1.8 K can be observed with a coercive field of 720 Oe, which is quite large for cyano-bridged Cr-Co molecular magnets. For compound 2 containing the diamagnetic [CoIII(CN)6]3- unit, field-induced slow magnetic relaxation was also verified, which makes compound 2 a rare example of an SIM assembled in a 2D network. An easy-plane magnetic anisotropy with a positive D value (29.9 cm-1 by PHI and 26.5 cm-1 by Anisofit2.0) was deduced for hepta-coordinated CoII centers.

946,"Novel photochromic 1-vinylidene-naphtho[2,1-b]furan derivatives (VNF-1 and VNF-2) were successfully anchored onto silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) through direct adsorption (SiO2@VNF-1) and covalent post-grafting (SiO2@VNF-2). SiO2 NPs with different sizes (15 ± 3 and 123 ± 7 nm) and surface chemistry (pHpzc in the range of 5-9) were used, offering a wide range of possibilities to fabricate tailor-made photochromic materials. The characterization of VNF-based SiO2 NPs confirmed the efficient VNF immobilization and the integrity of both organic and inorganic components. The photochromic behavior of these new nanoparticles indicates that silica surface acidity and the type of VNF immobilization strategy (adsorption vs. covalent grafting) were crucial factors for the occurrence of photochromism in the VNF-based SiO2 NPs. Upon UV (λ = 365 nm) or sunlight exposure for 1 min, only the SiO2@VNF-1 nanomaterials prepared by direct VNF adsorption onto SiO2 NPs with pHpzc ≈ 6.0 showed direct and reversible photochromic properties, developing fast (in seconds) and intense salmon and violet coloration, with high values of total color difference () and optical densities (ΔOD = 0.14-0.25). In contrast, all nanomaterials prepared by covalent grafting of VNF-2 onto SiO2 NPs (SiO2@VNF-2) did not exhibit photochromism. In the case of the photochromic SiO2@VNF-1 NPs, the decoloration process followed a bi-exponential decay with fast rate constants (k1 = 1.6 × 10-1-1.6 min-1 and k2 = 9.1 × 10-3-1.3 × 10-1 min-1), which were responsible for the loss of coloration in less than 10 min.

Here we manipulated language familiarity to test the hypothesis that phonological experience affects voice discrimination via mediating the engagement of multiple perceptual and cognitive resources. The results showed that during voice discrimination, the activation of several prefrontal regions was modulated by language familiarity. More importantly, the same effect was observed concerning the functional connectivity from the fronto-parietal network to the voice-identity network (VIN), and from the default mode network to the VIN. Our findings indicate that phonological experience could bias the recruitment of cognitive control and information retrieval/comparison processes during voice discrimination.

949,"Research shows that health care use among Latino immigrants is adversely affected by restrictive immigration policy. A core concern is that immigrants shy away from sharing personal information in response to policies that expand bureaucratic monitoring of citizenship status across service-providing organizations. This investigation addresses the concern that immigration politics also negatively influences health care utilization among Latino US citizens. One implication is that health insurance expansions may not reduce health care inequities among Latinos due to concern about exposure to immigration law enforcement authorities. Using data from the 2015 Latino National Health and Immigration Survey, we examine the extent to which the politics of immigration deters individuals from going to health care providers and service-providing institutions. Results indicate that Latino US citizens are less likely to make an appointment to see a health care provider when the issue of immigration is mentioned. Additionally, Latino US citizens who know someone who has been deported are more inclined to perceive that information shared with health care providers is not secure. We discuss how cautious citizenship, or risk-avoidance behaviors toward public institutions in order to avoid scrutiny of citizenship status, informs debates about reducing health care inequities.",28663179,2017,Cautious Citizenship: The Deterring Effect of Immigration Issue Salience on Health Care Use and Bureaucratic Interactions among Latino US Citizens.

Little is known about how symptom burden changes over time in adults with ESLD and their informal caregivers, which limits our ability to develop palliative care interventions that can optimize symptom management and quality of life in different patient-caregiver dyads. The purpose of this article is to describe the background and design of a prospective, longitudinal descriptive study, ""Symptom Burden in End-Stage Liver Disease Patient-Caregiver Dyads,"" which is currently in progress. The study is designed to (i) identify trajectories of change in physical and psychological symptom burden in adults with ESLD; (ii) identify trajectories of change in physical and psychological symptom burden in caregivers of adults with ESLD; and (iii) determine predictors of types of patient-caregiver dyads that would benefit from tailored palliative care interventions. We aim for a final sample of 200 patients and 200 caregivers who will be followed over 12 months. Integrated multilevel and latent growth mixture modeling will be used to identify trajectories of change in symptom burden, linking those changes to clinical events, and quality of life outcomes and characterizing types of patient-caregiver dyads based on patient-, caregiver-, and dyad-level factors. Challenges we have encountered include unexpected attrition of study participants, participants not returning their baseline questionnaires, and hiring and training of research staff.

We applied network analysis to characterize neurodevelopmental gene expression, revealing widespread transcriptional changes in Chd8+/del5 mice across pathways disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurogenesis, synaptic processes and neuroimmune signaling. We identified a co-expression module with peak expression in early brain development featuring dysregulation of RNA processing, chromatin remodeling and cell-cycle genes enriched for promoter binding by Chd8, and we validated increased neuronal proliferation and developmental splicing perturbation in Chd8+/del5 mice.

953,"Human and several nonhuman species share the rare ability of modifying acoustic and/or syntactic features of sounds produced, i.e. vocal learning, which is the important neurobiological and behavioral substrate of human speech/language. This convergent trait was suggested to be associated with significant genomic convergence and best manifested at the ROBO-SLIT axon guidance pathway. Here we verified the significance of such genomic convergence and assessed its functional relevance to human speech/language using human genetic variation data. In normal human populations, we found the affected amino acid sites were well fixed and accompanied with significantly more associated protein-coding SNPs in the same genes than the rest genes. Diseased individuals with speech/language disorders have significant more low frequency protein coding SNPs but they preferentially occurred outside the affected genes. Such patients' SNPs were enriched in several functional categories including two axon guidance pathways (mediated by netrin and semaphorin) that interact with ROBO-SLITs. Four of the six patients have homozygous missense SNPs on PRAME gene family, one youngest gene family in human lineage, which possibly acts upon retinoic acid receptor signaling, similarly as FOXP2, to modulate axon guidance. Taken together, we suggest the axon guidance pathways (e.g. ROBO-SLIT, PRAME gene family) served as common targets for human speech/language evolution and related disorders.",28692932,2017,Axon guidance pathways served as common targets for human speech/language evolution and related disorders.
954,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO) are one of the most highly produced nanomaterials and are used in numerous applications including cosmetics and sunscreens despite reports demonstrating their cytotoxicity. Dissolution is viewed as one of the main sources of nanoparticle (NP) toxicity; however, dissolution studies can be time-intensive to perform and complicated by issues such as particle separation from solution. Our work attempts to overcome some of these challenges by utilizing new methods using UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy to quantitatively assess nZnO dissolution in various biologically relevant solutions. All biological buffers tested induce rapid dissolution of nZnO. These buffers, including HEPES, MOPS, and PIPES, are commonly used in cell culture media, cellular imaging solutions, and to maintain physiological pH. Additional studies using X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ICP-MS, and TEM were performed to understand how the inclusion of these nonessential media components impacts the behavior of nZnO in RPMI media. From these assessments, we demonstrate that HEPES causes increased dissolution kinetics, boosts the conversion of nZnO into zinc phosphate/carbonate, and, interestingly, alters the structural morphology of the complex precipitates formed with nZnO in cell culture conditions. Cell viability experiments demonstrated that the inclusion of these buffers significantly decrease the viability of Jurkat leukemic cells when challenged with nZnO.

955,"Risk and protective processes are integrated developmental processes that directly or indirectly affect behavioral outcomes. A better understanding of these processes is needed, in order to gauge their contribution to sexual risk behaviors. This retrospective cross-sectional study modeled the ecodevelopmental chain of relationships to examine the social contexts of African-American (AA) adolescents associated with sexually transmitted disease (STD)- and HIV-risk behaviors. We used data from 1,619 AA adolescents with an average age of 16±1.8 years obtained from the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health for this study. Confirmatory factor analysis followed by structural equation modeling was conducted to identify the latent constructs that reflect the social-interactional components of the ecodevelopmental theory. Among contextual factors, findings indicated that a feeling of love from father, school, religion, and parent attitudes toward adolescent sexual behavior were all factors that played significant roles in the sexual behavior of AA adolescents. AA adolescents who reported feeling love from their father, feeling a strong negative attitude from their parents toward having sex at a very young age, and having a strong bond with school personnel were associated with better health statuses. The level of parents' involvement in their children's lives was reflected in the adolescents' feeling of love from parents and moderated by their socioeconomic status. Being male, attaining increased age, and being a sexual minority were associated with higher likelihood of exhibiting risky sexual behavior. In contrast, higher socioeconomic status and fathers' level of involvement were indirectly associated with reduced STD/HIV-related sexual risk behavior. In conclusion, our findings suggest that interventions aimed at maximal protection against STD/HIV-related risk behavior among AA adolescents should adopt both self- and context-based strategies that promote positive functioning in the family, school, and peer microsystems.",28694710,2017,Modeling ecodevelopmental context of sexually transmitted disease/HIV risk and protective behaviors among African-American adolescents.
956,"PURPOSE
To detect local cholinergic changes in human medial temporal lobe during configural working memory performance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) measurements were acquired at 3T from a 2 × 2 × 3 cm voxel in right medial temporal lobe from 36 subjects during performance of a configural visual working memory task (cWMT). In order to compensate for expected task-based blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) T2 * effects, resonance signal changes of unbound choline-containing metabolites (Cho) were referenced to an internal standard of creatine + phosphocreatine metabolites (Cre) and compared between four task blocks: rest, memorization, active memory maintenance, and recognition. An unannounced memory retention test was conducted in 21 subjects. Quality assurance analyses examined task-based Cho and Cre individually as well as referenced to resonance signal from N-acetylaspartate (NAA).


RESULTS
Increases from a resting baseline in the Cho/Cre ratio were observed during 60-second blocks of active memory maintenance across the group (P = 0.0042). Behavioral accuracy during task performance correlated with memory retention (r = 0.48, P = 0.027). Quality assurance measures showed task-based changes in Cre resonance signal both individually (P = 0.00099) and when utilized as a noncholinergic internal reference (NAA/Cre, P = 0.00079).


CONCLUSION
Increases in human medial temporal lobe 1 H-MRS Cho/Cre ratio occur during the maintenance of configural working memory information. However, interpretation of these results as driven by cholinergic activity cannot be assumed, as NAA, a noncholinergic metabolite, shows similar results when utilizing Cre as a reference. Caution is advised when considering Cre as an internal standard for task-based 1 H-MRS measurements.

The current study was an evaluation of the use, appreciation, and fidelity of two post-discharge counseling interventions designed for cardiac patients to quit smoking that differed in their delivery mode. In a controlled trial with cross-over randomization at the cardiac unit level, hospitalized smokers in eight cardiac units of eight Dutch hospitals were assigned either telephone counseling (n = 223) or nurse-administered face-to-face counseling (n = 157) using the Ask-Advise-Refer strategy. Eligible patients also received nicotine replacement therapy. Data based on counselors' registration forms and patients' telephone surveys at 6-month follow-up were analyzed. Most patients (>90%) participated in at least one counseling session, and the majority participated in at least five out of a maximum of seven sessions. Higher levels of adherence to either the telephone or face-to-face counseling sessions were associated with higher smoking abstinence rates at the 6-month follow-up, whereas higher nicotine patch use was not associated with abstinence. Patients positively evaluated the content, duration, and number of sessions, and rated the face-to-face counseling significantly better than the telephone counseling for quitting smoking. The counselors largely complied with the intervention protocols. The current intervention offers evidence of feasibility and may improve outpatient continuity of smoking care.

In this study, we used partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate analytic technique, to investigate the neural networks used by dyslexics while performing a word-rhyming task. Although the overall reading network was largely similar in dyslexics and typical readers, it did not correlate with behavior in the same way in the two groups. In particular, there was a positive association between reading performance and both right superior temporal gyrus and bilateral insula activation in dyslexic readers but a negative correlation in typical readers. Together with differences in lateralization unique to dyslexics, this suggests that the combination of poor reading performance with high insula activity and atypical laterality is a consistent marker of dyslexia. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding right-hemisphere activation in dyslexia and provide promising directions for the remediation of reading disorders.",28715717,2017,"Reading network in dyslexia: Similar, yet different."
960,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects approximately half of HIV-infected patients. Loss of synaptic connections is a hallmark of many neurocognitive disorders, including HAND. The HIV-1 protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) disrupts synaptic connections both in vitro and in vivo and has been linked to impaired neurocognitive function in humans. In vitro studies have shown that ifenprodil, an antagonist selective for GluN2B-containing NMDARs, reverses synapse loss when applied after Tat. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Tat-induced loss and ifenprodil-mediated rescue of synaptic spines in vivo would predict impairment and rescue of cognitive function. Using intracranial multiphoton imaging, we found that infusion of 100 ng of HIV-1 Tat into the lateral ventricle of yellow fluorescent protein-expressing transgenic mice produced a 17 ± 1% loss of dendritic spines in layer 1 of retrosplenial cortex. Repeated imaging of the same dendrites over 3 weeks enabled longitudinal experiments that demonstrated sustained spine loss after Tat infusion and transient rescue after ifenprodil administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Parallel trace fear conditioning experiments showed that spine loss predicted learning deficits and that the time course of ifenprodil-induced rescue of spine density correlated with restoration of cognitive function. These results show for the first time that, during exposure to an HIV-1 neurotoxin in vivo, alteration of GluN2B-containing NMDAR signaling suppresses spine density and impairs learning. Pharmacological inhibition of these NMDARs rescued spines and restored cognitive function. Drugs that rescue synapses may improve neurocognitive function in HAND.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptodendritic damage correlates with cognitive decline in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) patients. We developed an in vivo imaging approach for longitudinal tracking of spine density that enabled correlation of synaptic changes with behavioral outcomes in a model of HAND. We show for the first time that spine loss after exposure to an HIV-1 protein can be reversed pharmacologically and that loss and recovery of dendritic spines predict impairment and restoration of cognitive function, respectively. Therefore, synapse loss, the hallmark of cognitive decline in HAND, is reversible.

In this study, we found that the upregulated CCL2 was mainly expressed in hippocampal neurons and activated microglia from mice 1 d after kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. Taking advantage of CX3CR1:CCR2 double-transgenic mice, we demonstrated that CCL2-CCR2 signaling has a role in resident microglial activation and blood-derived monocyte infiltration. Moreover, seizure-induced degeneration of neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region was attenuated in mice lacking CCL2 or CCR2. We further showed that CCR2 activation induced STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation and IL-1β production, which are critical for promoting neuronal cell death after status epilepticus. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 by WP1066 reduced seizure-induced IL-1β production and subsequent neuronal death. Two weeks after KA-induced seizures, CCR2 deficiency not only reduced neuronal loss, but also attenuated seizure-induced behavioral impairments, including anxiety, memory decline, and recurrent seizure severity. Together, we demonstrated that CCL2-CCR2 signaling contributes to neurodegeneration via STAT3 activation and IL-1β production after status epilepticus, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Epilepsy is a global concern and epileptic seizures occur in many neurological conditions. Neuroinflammation associated with microglial activation and monocyte infiltration are characteristic of epileptic brains. However, molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation in neuronal death following epilepsy remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that CCL2-CCR2 signaling is required for monocyte infiltration, which in turn contributes to kainic acid (KA)-induced neuronal cell death. The downstream of CCR2 activation involves STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation and IL-1β production. Two weeks after KA-induced seizures, CCR2 deficiency not only reduced neuronal loss, but also attenuated seizure-induced behavioral impairments, including anxiety, memory decline, and recurrent seizure severity. The current study provides a novel insight on the function and mechanisms of CCL2-CCR2 signaling in KA-induced neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits.",28716963,2017,Chemokine CCL2-CCR2 Signaling Induces Neuronal Cell Death via STAT3 Activation and IL-1β Production after Status Epilepticus.
962,"Adaptive behavior requires context-sensitive configuration of task-sets that specify time-varying stimulus-response mappings. Intriguingly, response time costs associated with changing task-sets and motor responses are known to be strongly interactive: switch costs at the task level are small in the presence of a response-switch but large when accompanied by a response-repetition, and vice versa for response-switch costs. The reasons behind this well known interdependence between task- and response-level control processes are currently not well understood. Here, we formalized and tested a model assuming a hierarchical organization of superordinate task-set and subordinate response-set selection processes to account for this effect. The model was found to successfully explain the full range of behavioral task- and response-switch costs across first and second order trial transitions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy humans, we then characterized the neural circuitry mediating these effects. We found that presupplementary motor area (preSMA) activity tracked task-set control costs, SMA activity tracked response-set control costs, and basal ganglia (BG) activity mirrored the interaction between task- and response-set regulation processes that characterized participants' response times. A subsequent fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation experiment confirmed dissociable roles of the preSMA and SMA in determining response costs. Together, these data provide evidence for a hierarchical organization of posterior medial frontal cortex and its interaction with the BG, where a superordinate preSMA-BG loop establishes task-set selection, which imposes a (unidirectional) constraint on a subordinate SMA-BG loop that determines response-selection, resulting in the characteristic interdependence in task- and response-switch costs in behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability to use context-sensitive task-sets to guide our responses is central to human adaptive behavior. Task and response selection are strongly interactive: it is more difficult to repeat a response in the context of a changing task-set, and vice versa. However, the neurocognitive architecture giving rise to this interdependence is currently not understood. Here we use modeling, neuroimaging, and noninvasive neurostimulation to show that this phenomenon derives from a hierarchical organization of posterior medial frontal cortex and its interaction with the basal ganglia, where a more anterior corticostriatal loop establishes task-set selection, which constrains a more posterior loop responsible for response-selection. These data provide a neural explanation for a key behavioral signature of human cognitive control.",28716966,2017,Hierarchically Organized Medial Frontal Cortex-Basal Ganglia Loops Selectively Control Task- and Response-Selection.
963,"Over the past few decades, (poly)peptide block copolymers have been widely employed in generating well-defined nanostructures as vehicles for targeted drug delivery applications. We previously reported the assembly of thermoresponsive nanoscale vesicles from an elastin-b-collagen-like peptide (ELP-CLP). The vesicles were observed to dissociate at elevated temperatures, despite the LCST-like behavior of the tethered ELP domain, which is suggested to be triggered by the unfolding of the CLP domain. Here, the potential of using the vesicles as drug delivery vehicles for targeting collagen-containing matrices is evaluated. The sustained release of an encapsulated model drug was achieved over a period of 3 weeks, following which complete release could be triggered via heating. The ELP-CLP vesicles show strong retention on a collagen substrate, presumably through collagen triple helix interactions. Cell viability and proliferation studies using fibroblasts and chondrocytes suggest that the vesicles are highly cytocompatible. Additionally, essentially no activation of a macrophage-like cell line is observed, suggesting that the vesicles do not initiate an inflammatory response. Endowed with thermally controlled delivery, the ability to bind collagen, and excellent cytocompatibility, these ELP-CLP nanovesicles are suggested to have significant potential in the controlled delivery of drugs to collagen-containing matrices and tissues.",28719196,2017,Thermoresponsive Elastin-b-Collagen-Like Peptide Bioconjugate Nanovesicles for Targeted Drug Delivery to Collagen-Containing Matrices.
964,"The utility of tandem ion mobility mass spectrometry coupled with electronic spectroscopy to investigate protomer-specific photochemistry is demonstrated by measuring the photoisomerization response for protomers of protonated 4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-para-dimethylaminostyryl-4H-pyran (DCM) molecules. The target DCMH+ species has three protomers that are distinguished by their different collision cross sections with He, N2, and CO2 buffer gases, trends in abundance with ion source conditions, and from their photoisomerization responses. The trans-DCMH+ protomers with the proton located either on the tertiary amine N atom or on a cyano group N atom exhibit distinct S1← S0 photoisomerization responses, with the maxima in their photoisomerization action spectra occurring at 420 and 625 nm, respectively, consistent with predictions from accompanying electronic structure calculations. The cis-DCMH+ protomers are not distinguishable from one another through ion mobility separation and give no discernible photoisomerization or photodissociation response, suggesting the dominance of other deactivation pathways such as fluorescence. The study demonstrates that isobaric protomers and isomers generated by an electrospray ion source can possess quite different photochemical behaviors and emphasizes the utility of isomer and protomer selective techniques for exploring the spectroscopic and photochemical properties of protonated molecules in the gas phase.",28723091,2017,Protomer-Specific Photochemistry Investigated Using Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.
965,"As vectors, mosquitoes transmit numerous mosquito-borne diseases. Among the many factors affecting the distribution and density of mosquitoes, climate change and warming have been increasingly recognized as major ones. In this paper, we make use of three diffusive logistic models with free boundary in one space dimension to explore the impact of climate warming on the movement of mosquito range. First, a general model incorporating temperature change with location and time is introduced. In order to gain insights of the model, a simplified version of the model with the change of temperature depending only on location is analyzed theoretically, for which the dynamical behavior is completely determined and presented. The general model can be modified into a more realistic one of seasonal succession type, to take into account of the seasonal changes of mosquito movements during each year, where the general model applies only for the time period of the warm seasons of the year, and during the cold season, the mosquito range is fixed and the population is assumed to be in a hibernating status. For both the general model and the seasonal succession model, our numerical simulations indicate that the long-time dynamical behavior is qualitatively similar to the simplified model, and the effect of climate warming on the movement of mosquitoes can be easily captured. Moreover, our analysis reveals that hibernating enhances the chances of survival and successful spreading of the mosquitoes, but it slows down the spreading speed.",28726158,2018,Free boundary models for mosquito range movement driven by climate warming.
966,"Recently, two contradicting experimental investigations have been published on the fluorescence behavior of 4-fluoro-N,N-dimethylaniline (FDMA). Motivated by the discrepancies between these studies, we have examined the deactivation pathways of photoexcited FDMA using high-level quantum chemical methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), coupled cluster (CC2) theory, and the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme (ADC(2), ADC(3)) simulating solvation using continuum solvation models. Our results show the initial population of the bright S2 (ππ*) state of FDMA relax to a linear, almost planar S1 state minimum from which emission occurs. Our study further reveals that TDDFT/B3LYP erroneously predicts a planar twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) S1 state minimum that vanishes when the amount of nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange in the functional is increased.",28727451,2017,"Regular Fluorescence of 4-Fluoro-N,N-dimethylaniline: No Charge Transfer and No Twisting."
967,"BACKGROUND
Combining opioid medications and alcohol has serious implications for patient health, including overdose. Information regarding those who use/misuse opioid medications and engage in unhealthy alcohol use is limited to pharmacological and epidemiological descriptions. This study presents opioid medication misuse and behavioral, mental, and physical health characteristics of persons filling opioid medications that are engaged in unhealthy alcohol use.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 5 community pharmacies in Southwestern, Pennsylvania among patients filling opioid medications. Respondents completed validated opioid medication misuse, alcohol use, illicit drug use, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and physical health functioning assessments. We present univariate and multivariate statistics describing opioid medication misuse and health risks among those positive for unhealthy alcohol use.


RESULTS
A total of 344 patients completed the survey (75.8% response). A total of 15.9% of respondents screened positive for opioid medication misuse, of whom 20.3% reported unhealthy alcohol use. Taking opioid medications too often was reported among a larger proportion of the sample with unhealthy alcohol use (34.3%) compared to those without (22.1%, p=0.04). Further, among respondents with unhealthy alcohol use, illicit drug use (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=12.14, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.64-89.72) and PTSD (AOR=9.77, 95% CI=1.70-56.11) were associated with increased odds for opioid medication misuse.


CONCLUSION
Results suggest respondents with unhealthy alcohol use had distinct health profiles, which may place them at risk for opioid misuse and adverse events, such as overdose. Continued research must work to further understand these relationships and identify intervention and treatment strategies.",28735077,2017,Opioid medication misuse among unhealthy drinkers.

Phase transitions at 1.3, 3.6-5.8, and 17.2 GPa were found and evidenced by the frequency shifts, pressure coefficients, and changes in fwhm of related modes. These phase transitions were suggested to result from the changes in the inter- and intramolecular bonding of the material. Interestingly, the CH3 groups was compelled to be frozen in positions at a relatively low pressure, suggested by the disappearance of the relative modes softening.

These compounds can be selectively obtained by controlling the reaction ratio of Ln(hfac)3·2H2O to the radical ligand NIT-2-Pm. The crystal structures show that in the former four complexes 1-4, the NIT-2-Pm radical acts as a terminal bidentate ligand chelating to one LnIII ion, while in 5-8, the NIT-2-Pm acts as a bridging ligand linking two LnIII ions to form a binuclear three-spin system. Magnetic studies revealed that complexes 1-4 and 6 show frequency-dependent ac magnetic susceptibilities, suggesting a possible single-molecule magnet behavior. To the best of our knowledge, complexes 3 and 4 are the first Ho-NIT and Er-NIT compounds showing slow magnetic relaxation.

In the ODE context, such flare-ups would translate into sustained oscillations with significant amplitudes. Our results show that such oscillations are ruled out in Susceptible-Aware-Infectious-Susceptible models with a single compartment of aware hosts, but can occur if we consider two distinct compartments of aware hosts who differ in their willingness to alert other susceptible hosts.",28755134,2018,Oscillations in epidemic models with spread of awareness.

Obtaining a better understanding of what behaviors children are displaying in these settings provides valuable information to inform teacher education in this area as well as support systems for children. One hundred and seven Australian educators from care organizations, preschools, and government, independent, and Catholic primary schools participated in an extensive online questionnaire in relation to their understanding of and experiences with children's problematic sexual behaviors and their management strategies. Results found that 40.8% of educators had observed children displaying problematic sexual behavior in their educational setting. Educators' descriptions of their observations variously involved children physically acting out sexually with other children, sexually harassing other children, verbally attempting to coerce other children to participate in sexual behavior, and individual displays of sexual behavior. A minority described behaviors that are considered developmentally typical but are not socially acceptable in an educational setting.

975,"OBJECTIVE
To explore how persons with late effects of polio experience falls and what strategies they use to manage the consequences of falls.


DESIGN
A qualitative study with face-to-face interviews. Data were analysed by systematic text condensation.


PARTICIPANTS
Fourteen ambulatory persons (7 women; mean age 70 years) with late effects of polio.


RESULTS
Analysis resulted in one main theme, ""Everyday life is a challenge to avoid the consequences of falls"", and 3 categories with 7 subcategories. Participants perceived that falls were unpredictable and could occur anywhere. Even slightly uneven surfaces could cause a fall, and increased impairments following late effects of polio led to reduced movement control and an inability to adjust balance quickly. Physical injuries were described after the falls, as well as emotional and psychological reactions, such as embarrassment, frustration and fear of falling. Assistive devices, careful planning and strategic thinking were strategies to prevent falls, together with adaptation and social comparisons to mitigate the emotional reactions.


CONCLUSION
Experiences of falls greatly affect persons with late effects of polio in daily life. To reduce falls and fall-related consequences both problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies are used. In order to increase daily functioning, these findings should be included in a multifaceted falls management programme.",28792586,2017,Experiences of falls and strategies to manage the consequences of falls in persons with late effects of polio: A qualitative study.

To conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the Brazilian version of the New Moves program (NMP) versus observation among Brazilian adolescent girls.


METHODS
Ten schools were randomly allocated to the Brazilian NMP or the observation arm. Study participants included 12-14-year-old girls. Recruitment occurred between February 2014 and March 2015. The NMP included sports, nutritional support, motivational interviews, collective lunch, and parental information materials. Our main outcome was the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Secondary outcomes included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Unhealthy Weight-Control Behaviors Index, as well as body mass index. Study results were evaluated through generalized estimating equations.


RESULTS
A total of 270 adolescents participated in the study. At baseline, mean age was 13.4 years, and average BMI was 21.4. The intervention did not result in any statistically significant differences between the NMP and the observation arm, including BSQ (predicted means of 64.33 - IC 95% 59.2-69.47 vs. 62.02 - IC 95% 56.63-67.4), respectively) and our secondary outcomes. Adherence was low during the intervention (32.9%) and maintenance (19.1%) phases of the program.


CONCLUSION

977,"OBJECTIVES
Developing compassion towards oneself has been linked to improvement in many areas of psychological well-being, including psychosis. Furthermore, developing a non-judgemental, accepting way of relating to voices is associated with lower levels of distress for people who hear voices. These factors have also been associated with secure attachment. This study explores associations between the constructs of mindfulness of voices, self-compassion, and distress from hearing voices and how secure attachment style related to each of these variables.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional online.


METHOD
One hundred and twenty-eight people (73% female; Mage  = 37.5; 87.5% Caucasian) who currently hear voices completed the Self-Compassion Scale, Southampton Mindfulness of Voices Questionnaire, Relationships Questionnaire, and Hamilton Programme for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire.


RESULTS
Results showed that mindfulness of voices mediated the relationship between self-compassion and severity of voices, and self-compassion mediated the relationship between mindfulness of voices and severity of voices. Self-compassion and mindfulness of voices were significantly positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with distress and severity of voices.


CONCLUSION
Mindful relation to voices and self-compassion are associated with reduced distress and severity of voices, which supports the proposed potential benefits of mindful relating to voices and self-compassion as therapeutic skills for people experiencing distress by voice hearing.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Greater self-compassion and mindfulness of voices were significantly associated with less distress from voices. These findings support theory underlining compassionate mind training.

The present study involved field measurements of several alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), along with PBDEs and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in surface water, bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) within a highly urbanized watershed in Singapore. Several alternative HFRs were detected in water and sediments. Dechlornane Plus stereoisomers (syn- and anti-DP) were detected in all samples, exhibiting relatively high concentrations in water, sediments and SPM. The maximum syn-DP concentrations in water, sediments and SPM were 24.30 ng/L, 2.48 ng/g dry wt. and 7774 ng/g dry wt., respectively. 1,2-Bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromotoluene (PBT), hexabromobenzene (HxBBz) and tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) were routinely detected. PBDE concentrations were relatively low and often non-detectable. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations ranged from 0.017 to 8.37 ng/L in water, 9.86-27.92 ng/g dry wt. in SPM, and 6.48-212.3 ng/g dry wt. in sediments. Congener and isomer patterns suggested no recent inputs of PBDEs or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Rainfall was found to be an important factor influencing temporal and spatial patterns of DPs, BTBPE, PBDEs and some organochlorines in surface water. Land use index was found to be important for several organochlorines, but not HFRs. The observed sediment-water partitioning behavior of the studied HFRs and legacy POPs was highly dependent on chemical hydrophobicity. The data demonstrate that the studied HFRs have a relatively high affinity for SPM and bottom sediments.

Focusing on time vector, this work uses two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) techniques to examine the structural features of water-soluble (WSOM) and alkaline-soluble organic matter (ASOM) sequentially extracted from fine atmospheric aerosols collected in an urban setting during cold and warm seasons. This study reveals molecular signatures not previously decoded in NMR-related studies of OAs as meaningful source markers. Although the ASOM is less hydrophilic and structurally diverse than its WSOM counterpart, both fractions feature a core with heteroatom-rich branched aliphatics from both primary (natural and anthropogenic) and secondary origin, aromatic secondary organics originated from anthropogenic aromatic precursors, as well as primary saccharides and amino sugar derivatives from biogenic emissions. These common structures represent those 2D NMR spectral signatures that are present in both seasons and can thus be seen as an ""annual background"" profile of the structural composition of OAs at the urban location. Lignin-derived structures, nitroaromatics, disaccharides, and anhydrosaccharides signatures were also identified in the WSOM samples only from periods identified as smoke impacted, which reflects the influence of biomass-burning sources.

980,"Social relationships throughout life are vital for well-being and physical and mental health. A significant amount of research in animal models as well as in humans suggests that oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in the development of the capacity to form social bonds, the mediation of the positive aspects of early-life nurturing on adult bonding capacity, and the maintenance of social bonding. Here, we focus on the extensive research on a socially monogamous rodent model organism, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). OT facilitates mating-induced pair bonds in adults through interaction with the mesolimbic dopamine system. Variation in striatal OT receptor density predicts resilience and susceptibility to neonatal social neglect in female prairie voles. Finally, in adults, loss of a partner results in multiple disruptions in OT signaling, including decreased OT release in the striatum, which is caused by an activation of the brain corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system. The dramatic behavioral consequence of partner loss is increased depressive-like behavior reminiscent of bereavement. Importantly, infusions of OT into the striatum of adults prevents the onset of depressive-like behavior following partner loss, and evoking endogenous OT release using melanocortin agonists during neonatal social isolation rescues impairments in social bonding in adulthood. This work has important translational implications relevant to the disruptions of social bonds in childhood and in adults.",28812266,2017,Oxytocin and Social Relationships: From Attachment to Bond Disruption.

982,"In this chapter, we introduce a new area of social pharmacology that encompasses the study of the role of neuromodulators in modulating a wide range of social behaviors and brain function, with the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors. There are increasing evidences for the role of the neuropeptide oxytocin in modulating a wide range of social behaviors, in reducing anxiety, and in impacting the social brain network. Oxytocin also promotes social functions in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and reduces anxiety and fear in anxiety disorders. In this chapter, we will emphasize the importance of integrating basic research and clinical human research in determining optimal strategies for drug discoveries for social dysfunctions and anxiety disorders. We will highlight the significance of adopting a precision medicine approach to optimize targeted treatments with oxytocin in neuropsychiatry. Oxytocin effects on social behavior and brain function can vary from one individual to another based on external factors, such as heterogeneity in autism phenotype, childhood experiences, personality, attachment style, and oxytocin receptor polymorphisms. Hence, targeted therapies for subgroups of patients can help alleviating some of the core symptoms and lead to a better future for these patients and their families.",28812273,2017,A Precision Medicine Approach to Oxytocin Trials.

Moreover, the spin state of respective Fe(II) ions and the antiferromagnetic interaction between them can be switched bidirectionally under alternating irradiation with 532 and 808 nm light, resulting in interconversion between paramagnetic and diamagnetic properties.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) promotes numerous psychological benefits, but few studies have identified for whom MBSR is most effective. The current study tested the hypothesis that lower baseline mindfulness invites more ""room to grow"" and, thus, predicts greater improvement during MBSR.


METHOD
We examined three facets of mindfulness (awareness, acceptance, decentering) among 131 MBSR participants prior to enrollment, to test the hypothesis that lower baseline mindfulness predicts greater improvements in perceived stress, positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA) following MBSR.


RESULTS
Lower acceptance and decentering predicted greater decreases in perceived stress. Higher awareness, acceptance, and decentering predicted greater increases in PA. Higher awareness predicted greater reductions in NA. Lower decentering predicted greater reductions in NA.

985,"A comprehensive reactivity study of nanojars toward 18 different acidic compounds with varying pKa, including 12 different carboxylic acids (both aliphatic and aromatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids), p-toluenesulfonic acid, hydrogen sulfate, hydrogen carbonate, carbonic acid, 1-decanethiol, and methanol, as well as four different conjugate bases (formate, acetate, benzoate, 2-bromoethanesulfonate) is carried out with the aid of electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. Thus, the effect on nanojar substitution and breakdown pattern of a number of variables, such as concentration of reagent (acid or conjugate base), acidity of reagent (pKa), effect of acid vs conjugate base, steric effects, aromaticity, incarcerated anion and size of the nanojar, is evaluated. Of the substitution and breakdown products identified by mass spectrometry, acetate-substituted nanojars (Bu4N)2[CO3⊂{Cu27(μ-OH)27(μ-pz)27-x(μ-CH3COO)x}] (x = 1 and 2), as well as dimeric complexes (Bu4N)2[Cu2(μ-pz)2A2] (A = CO32- and SO42-) have been isolated and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This study offers a detailed understanding of the behavior of nanojars of various sizes and with different incarcerated anions in the presence of the above-mentioned compounds at varying concentrations and tests the limits of the pyrazolate/carboxylate structural analogy in multinuclear metal complexes. The results point to the possibility of obtaining functionalized nanojars via pyrazolate/carboxylate ligand exchange, an aid in the design of anion extraction processes using nanojars or similar complexes as extracting agents.",28816444,2017,Mapping the Intricate Reactivity of Nanojars toward Molecules of Varying Acidity and Their Conjugate Bases Leading To Exchange of Pyrazolate Ligands.
986,"A new series of mixed valence perovskites, La0.75K0.25AMnTiO6 (A = Sr and Ba) nanocubes, have been synthesized by a mild hydrothermal route. From powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the crystal structure of La0.75K0.25AMnTiO6 was solved as the orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pbnm) with a random A-site or B-site arrangement. The phase purity of the products was confirmed by ICP, SEM, and EDS analyses, and the oxidation states of the B-site metal atoms were determined to be +4 for Ti and +3/+4 for Mn from XPS results. The soft ferromagnetic behavior is present in both samples. The Curie point TC has been detected as high as 309 K in La0.75K0.25SrMnTiO6 and 217 K in La0.75K0.25BaMnTiO6. A Griffiths phase can be observed at the high temperature region, which is related to the magnetic inhomogeneity induced by the existence of short-range ferromagnetic clusters.

987,"Results of periodic DFT simulations have been used to gain a new view of the crystal chemistry of LiBSi2 in terms of computational modeling of the LiB + 2Si → LiBSi2 synthesis reaction. It was shown that both the strong alkali-metal-[BSi2]- interaction and the rich behavior of B-Si couplings are the main distinctive features of the chemical bonding picture in LiBSi2. In particular, an interplay between charge transfer from easily ionizable lithium linear chains to the boron atoms and strong covalent connectivities in the tetrahedral B-Si framework is of great importance for the bonding architecture in LiBSi2. The activation of positively ionized silicon species Si+ and the formation of electron-rich B3- anions in the [BSi2]- group were found to play a key role in providing the stability of boron-silicon polar covalent bonds. It was suggested that the Si+-B3--Si+ bonding pattern featuring the high anionic state of the boron atom can be identified as a boryl anion.",28829587,2017,Strong Effect of Anionic Boron-Induced Bonding in LiBSi2.

Using Wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (respondents aged 24-32, N = 14,334), we ran multivariate logistic regressions to estimate the probability of reporting trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and short sleep duration, based on specific sexual orientation categories. Results after controlling for mental health indicate that these categories are more likely to have trouble falling asleep: women who identify as ""bisexual"" (OR = 1.85, CI: 1.21,2.82), women attracted to ""both sexes"" (OR = 1.31, CI: 1.00,1.72), women who have had ""mostly opposite sex"" partners (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.10,1.77), and men who have had ""mostly same sex"" partners (OR = 2.28, CI: 1.21,4.31).

989,"OBJECTIVE
To assess whether suicidal behavior during mixed states exceeds that expected from the manic or depressive components alone.


METHODS
This study included 429 participants with bipolar disorder from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Depression Study (CDS). Mood and suicidal behavior were captured using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation and the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Suicidal behavior during each mood state, relative to euthymia, was analyzed using Cox regression to allow for repeated events, with a frailty term to account for intra-participant correlation. Mixed states were modeled as a depression-by-mania interaction.


RESULTS
Individuals with a history of mixed states were at higher risk of suicidal behavior and spent more time depressed, compared to subjects with no such history. In bipolar I disorder, risk increased during episodes of mania (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-2.99, P = .0019) and depression (HR: 5.49, 95% CI: 4.01-7.51, P < .0001) and there was a less than additive effect of mixed states. In bipolar II disorder, risk was increased during episodes of depression (HR: 3.66, 95% CI: 2.51-5.35, P < .0001) and there was no excess risk during mixed states beyond that attributable to the depressed component. Most of the excess risk (71%) among those with a history of mixed states was attributable to a depression predominant course of illness.


CONCLUSIONS
Individuals with mixed states are at high risk of suicidal behavior, largely due to more time spent depressed. Clinicians should aggressively treat depression to mitigate suicide risk for patients with or without mixed states.",28833953,2018,Mixed state and suicide: Is the effect of mixed state on suicidal behavior more than the sum of its parts?

991,"BACKGROUND
Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Differences in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of α-synuclein aggregation disorders including PD.


OBJECTIVES
To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals.


METHODS
Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms.


CONCLUSION
Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. © 2017 The Authors.

The BIS/BAS scales were also used to evaluate a participant's responses to reward- or punishment-related events in everyday situations. The results showed that adolescents with DLD performed on the BART at a suboptimal level due to inefficient use of response-contingent feedback. Findings of the BIS/BAS scales also generate a possible hypothesis of reduced motivational salience for larger monetary outcomes in DLD. Given that dopamine plays an important role in modulating BART responding through the corticostriatal pathways, these behavioral findings implicate an association between dopamine and individual differences in language, including DLD. Future studies are needed to directly test whether people with DLD have reduced level of dopamine in striatal neural synapses, leading to dopamine-dependent learning difficulty.",28841425,2017,Insensitivity to response-contingent feedback in adolescents with developmental language disorder (DLD).

995,"A series of Gd3+ dopings in zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) systems were undertaken to explore the resultant structural, morphological, hydrothermal aging, and mechanical behavior and imaging contrast abilities. The results from the characterization techniques demonstrate the significance of Gd3+ in preserving the structural stability of ZTA systems. ZTA undergoes phase degradation with 10 wt % Gd3+ at 1400 °C, while the 100 wt % Gd3+ yields GdAlO3 even at 1200 °C. Gd3+ doping at the intermediate level preserves the structural stability of ZTA systems until 1400 °C. Gd3+ occupies the ZrO2 lattice, and its gradual accumulation induces tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) to cubic ZrO2 (c-ZrO2) phase transition. α-Al2O3 crystallizes at 1200 °C and remains unperturbed except for its reaction with the free Gd3+ ions to yield GdAlO3.

The DyIII ion in these three complexes resides in a similar D4d coordination geometry with counteranions perturbing the coordination environment and bond lengths and angles in the lattice. Magnetostructural studies reveal that the asymmetric distribution of salicylaldehyde/pyridinyl-triazine ligands and the presence of discriminative counteranions result in the coexistence of large anisotropy and quantum tunneling of magnetization. The magnetic anisotropy is dominated by the axial ligand field with short Dy-Osali distances and large ∠Osali-Dy-Osali angles, while the quantum tunneling relaxation is probably dictated by the π-π stacking of the Lz ligands, which induces an axial constriction of the coordinating plane.

998,"Treatment satisfaction is recognized as an essential aspect in the evaluation of an intervention's effectiveness, but there is no measure that provides for its comprehensive assessment with regard to behavioral interventions. Informed by a conceptualization generated from a literature review, we developed a measure that covers several domains of satisfaction with behavioral interventions. In this paper, we briefly review its conceptualization and describe the Multi-Dimensional Treatment Satisfaction Measure (MDTSM) subscales. Satisfaction refers to the appraisal of the treatment's process and outcome attributes. The MDTSM has 11 subscales assessing treatment process and outcome attributes: treatment components' suitability and utility, attitude toward treatment, desire for continued treatment use, therapist competence and interpersonal style, format and dose, perceived benefits of the health problem and everyday functioning, discomfort, and attribution of outcomes to treatment. The MDTSM was completed by persons (N = 213) in the intervention group in a large trial of a multi-component behavioral intervention for insomnia within 1 week following treatment completion. The MDTSM's subscales demonstrated internal consistency reliability (α: .65 - .93) and validity (correlated with self-reported adherence and perceived insomnia severity at post-test). The MDTSM subscales can be used to assess satisfaction with behavioral interventions and point to aspects of treatments that are viewed favorably or unfavorably.",28857205,2017,Psychometric evaluation of a multi-dimensional measure of satisfaction with behavioral interventions.

We aimed to investigate the factors that make inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients more or less likely to be willing to take corticosteroids.


METHODS
Respondents completed a questionnaire. The primary outcome was whether the respondents would or would not use corticosteroids again to treat their IBD. Three separate univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine which variables predicted willingness to take steroids, including specific side effects.


RESULTS
Four hundred fifty three respondents (321 with Crohn's disease, 115 with ulcerative colitis; mean age 40 years, 297 [66%] female) completed the questionnaire. Corticosteroid efficacy (OR 6.83, 95% CI 3.67-12.7), lack of previous negative side effects (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.32), and positive side effects (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.63-5.40) were associated with a willingness to use corticosteroids in the future. In multivariate analysis, weight gain (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.98) and hallucinations (OR 0.28, CI 0.09-0.89) were associated with an unwillingness to use corticosteroids again, whereas increased energy (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.20-4.42) was the only significant positive side effect in a multivariate model.

1000,"In the voluntary task-switching paradigm, participants are required to randomly select tasks. We reasoned that the consistent finding of a repetition bias (i.e., participants repeat tasks more often than expected by chance) reflects reasonable adaptive task selection behavior to balance the goal of random task selection with the goals to minimize the time and effort for task performance. We conducted two experiments in which participants were provided with variable amount of preview for the non-chosen task stimuli (i.e., potential switch stimuli). We assumed that switch stimuli would initiate some pre-processing resulting in improved performance in switch trials. Results showed that reduced switch costs due to extra-preview in advance of each trial were accompanied by more task switches. This finding is in line with the characteristics of rational adaptive behavior. However, participants were not biased to switch tasks more often than chance despite large switch benefits. We suggest that participants might avoid effortful additional control processes that modulate the effects of preview on task performance and task choice.",28871331,2018,Exploring the repetition bias in voluntary task switching.
1001,"The chlorate-nitrous acid reaction was investigated in acid media, using a high concentration of reagents. It was followed via ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) spectroscopy and presented a complex behavior. The order of reagents, and the products formed by this reaction, are dependent on the concentration of reagents. For the high concentration set we used, the reaction has shown a first-order behavior for H+ and HNO2, and an order equal to 0.79 for chlorate. In this case, chlorine dioxide is formed. Moreover, chlorine dioxide starts to form only after all HNO2 has been consumed. This is the first time chlorine dioxide was observed to be formed by this reaction. Reduction of the concentration of reagents decreases the order of HNO2 to 0.91 and no chlorine dioxide is formed.

1002,"OBJECTIVES
Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm associated with low quality of life (QoL) and significant health-related costs. The purpose of the study was to examine patients' illness and treatment beliefs and ways of coping with AF symptoms, to provide insight into promoting better QoL and treatment-specific management.


DESIGN
Beliefs were explored across three procedural treatment groups using a qualitative cross-sectional design.


METHODS
Thirty semi-structured interviews were carried out with patients undertaking cardioversion (n = 10), catheter ablation (n = 11) and atrioventricular node ablation (n = 9). Interviews were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis with elements of grounded theory.


RESULTS
An overarching theme of a vicious cycle was evident, which related to perceived lack of knowledge and understanding of AF, attempts to control symptoms and negative emotional reactions to failed control attempts. This vicious cycle related to three subordinate themes: (1) unpredictability and uncertainty of AF and symptoms; (2) coping with symptoms through (a) avoidance (b) all-or-nothing- (c) slowing down behaviours; and (3) concerns and expectations about treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
Patients outlined a need to gain control of unpredictable symptoms by monitoring and varying activity levels. These behaviours were often appraised as ineffective at controlling symptoms, leading to heightened uncertainty and increased activity avoidance. Treatment concerns escalated with increasing number and invasiveness of procedures. Improving AF patients' perceived understanding of their illness and treatment and promoting more effective symptom-management strategies may alleviate psychological distress and improve QoL. Themes elaborated on the common-sense model whereby patients' beliefs about illness and treatment interact with coping behaviours. Statement of contribution What is already known about this subject? Quality of life (QoL) is disproportionately low in people with persistent atrial fibrillation (psAF). The common-sense model suggests illness perceptions and coping predict QoL in chronic illnesses. No previous studies have examined the idiosyncratic beliefs and coping behaviours of psAF patients. What does this study add? A vicious cycle of perceived lack of understanding of AF, attempts to control AF and distress at failed attempts at control, was a key theme. PsAF patients reported continued avoidance/all-or-nothing behaviours despite symptomatic relief post-procedure, and disengagement from enjoyable activities. PsAF patients reported procedure-specific concerns/expectations, which could be targeted in future interventions aimed at reducing distress.",28875586,2018,'It's like a frog leaping about in your chest': Illness and treatment perceptions in persistent atrial fibrillation.

Compared with the analogue {CoII2DyIII2}, the {Ni2IIDy2III} shows longer relaxation time and an absence of the quantum tunnelling of the magnetization (QTM) at low temperatures. Ab initio calculations suggest that the zero-field QTM of {Ni2IIDy2III} is effectively interrupted thanks to the ferromagnetic exchange coupling generated between NiII and DyIII ions.

Joint physical custody (JPC), where children spend about equal time in both parent's homes after parental separation, is increasing. The suitability of this practice for preschool children, with a need for predictability and continuity, has been questioned.


METHODS
In this cross-sectional study, we used data on 3656 Swedish children aged three to five years living in intact families, JPC, mostly with one parent or single care. Linear regression analyses were conducted with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, completed by parents and preschool teachers, as the outcome measure.

Maternal and infant sociodemographic factors have also shown a strong association with psychological distress and the mother-infant relationship. However, findings on their effects over time are limited. In this longitudinal analysis, we explored the relationship of maternal and infant sociodemographic variables (maternal age, maternal education, marital status, being on social assistance, maternal race, infant birth weight, and infant gender) to maternal psychological distress (depressive, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, parenting stress symptoms, and maternal worry about child's health) through 12 months corrected age for prematurity, and on the home environment, and mother-infant interactions through 6 months corrected age for prematurity. We also explored differences related to maternal obstetrical characteristics (gestational age at birth, parity, mode of delivery, and multiple birth) and severity of infant conditions (Apgar scores, need for mechanical ventilation, and infant medical complications). Although the relationship of maternal and infant characteristics with these outcomes did not change over time, psychological distress differed based on marital status, maternal education, infant gender, and infant medical complications.

1007,"Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp), surface functionalized with linear polyethylenimine (LPEI), was used for the preparation of biocomposites in combination with biopolymers and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), by cryogelation technique, to yield biomimetic scaffolds with controlled interconnected macroporosity, mechanical stability, and predictable degradation behavior. The structural characteristics, swelling and degradation behavior of hydroxyapatite and hydroxyapatite/β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) filled matrices were investigated as compared to the corresponding naked polymer 3D system. It was found that the homogeneity and cohesivity of the composite are significantly dependent on the size and amount of the included inorganic particles, which are thus determining the structural parameters. Surface modification with LPEI and nanodimensions favored the nHAp integration in the organic matrix, with preferential location along protein fibers, while β-TCP microparticles induced an increased disorder in the hybrid system. The biocomposite including nHAp only was further investigated targeting biomedical uses, and proved to be non-cytotoxic and capable of acting as gene-activated matrix (GAM). It allowed sustained delivery over time (until 22days) of embedded PEI25-pDNA polyplexes at high levels of transgene expression, while insuring a decrease in cytotoxicity as compared to polyplexes alone. Experimental data recommend such biocomposite as an attractive material for regenerative medicine.",28887961,2017,"Biopolymers/poly(ε-caprolactone)/polyethylenimine functionalized nano-hydroxyapatite hybrid cryogel: Synthesis, characterization and application in gene delivery."
1008,"We report the fabrication of novel nanofibers using naturally occurring antimicrobial honey incorporated in poly(1,4-cyclohexane dimethylene isosorbide trephthalate) (PICT) for the potential wound dressing applications. We fabricated PICT/honey using three blend ratios 90:10, 85:15 and 80:20 respectively. Morphology of PICT nanofibers and PICT/honey nanofibers was observed under Scanning Electron Microscope and it showed bead-free nanofibers. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscope was used to confirm the presence of honey in PICT electrospun nanofibers. Tensile strength of PICT/honey nanofibers was slightly reduced with variation in effect of elongation. Water contact angle measurements were done with the static contact angle by a contact angle meter, which showed that hydrophobicity was decreased by adding the honey. The XPS spectra showed that honey was present in the PICT/honey nanofibers. The release behavior of honey was investigated by UV-visible Spectrophotometer. The release was complete in 15min and the maximum release of honey was 72mg/L in 10min. Therefore, PICT/honey nanofibers having 15% concentration of honey are suitable for good elastic behavior and tensile strength as compared to other concentrations of honey.",28887970,2017,"Fabrication and characterization of nanofibers of honey/poly(1,4-cyclohexane dimethylene isosorbide trephthalate) by electrospinning."
1009,"In this study, a controlled drug release platform, amyloid-like bovine serum albumin (AL-BSA) with ampicillin sodium salt (amp), was developed. To develop this platform, 5%, 10%, and 20% (w/w) ratios of amp:BSA were used with electrospinning to prepare nanofibers with average diameters of 132±69, 159±60, and 179±42nm, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that AL-BSA could entrap large amounts of drug inside the nanofibers, which was attributed to the antimicrobial activity of the released drug against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The amount of drug released was measured by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. The nanofibrous matrix of the electrospun membrane showed controlled release behavior in all samples. The transport mechanism was Fickian for the low ratio of amp:BSA (5% w:w). When the drug ratio was increased to >10% (w:w), thicker fiber structures formed, suggesting that the drug traveled a longer distance to reach the fiber surface; thus, the mechanism of transport shifted from Fickian to non-Fickian.",28887973,2017,Controlled release of a hydrophilic drug from electrospun amyloid-like protein blend nanofibers.

1011,"The heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme heparanase promotes the progression of many cancers by driving tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Heparanase accomplishes this via multiple mechanisms including its recently described effect on enhancing biogenesis of tumor exosomes. Because we recently discovered that heparanase expression is upregulated in myeloma cells that survive chemotherapy, we were prompted to investigate the impact of anti-myeloma drugs on exosome biogenesis. When myeloma cells were exposed to the commonly utilized anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib or melphalan, exosome secretion by the cells was dramatically enhanced. These chemotherapy-induced exosomes (chemoexosomes) have a proteome profile distinct from cells not exposed to drug including a dramatic elevation in the level of heparanase present as exosome cargo. The chemoexosome heparanase was not found inside the chemoexosome, but was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an extracellular matrix. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their heparan sulfate degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-α, an important myeloma growth factor. Moreover, chemoexosomes stimulated macrophage migration and this effect was blocked by H1023, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. These data suggest that anti-myeloma therapy ignites a burst of exosomes having a high level of heparanase that remodels extracellular matrix and alters tumor and host cell behaviors that likely contribute to chemoresistance and eventual patient relapse.


SUMMARY
We find that anti-myeloma chemotherapy dramatically stimulates secretion of exosomes and alters exosome composition. Exosomes secreted during therapy contain high levels of heparanase on their surface that can degrade ECM and also can be transferred to both tumor and host cells, altering their behavior in ways that may enhance tumor survival and progression.",28888912,2018,Chemotherapy induces secretion of exosomes loaded with heparanase that degrades extracellular matrix and impacts tumor and host cell behavior.
1012,"Repetitive and perseverative behaviors are common features of a number of neuropsychiatric diseases such as Angelman's syndrome, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. The oxytocin system has been linked to the regulation of repetitive behavior in both animal models and humans, but many of its downstream targets have still to be found. We report that the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system is a target of the oxytocin system in regulating one repetitive behavior, marble burying. First we report that nearly 60% of MCH neurons express oxytocin receptors, and demonstrate using rabies mediated tract tracing that MCH neurons receive direct presynaptic input from oxytocin neurons. Then we show that MCH receptor knockout (MCHR1KO) mice and MCH ablated animals display increased marble burying response while central MCH infusion decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate the downstream role of the MCH system on oxytocin mediated marble burying by showing that central infusions of MCH and oxytocin alone or together reduce it while antagonizing the MCH system blocks oxytocin-mediated reduction of this behavior. Our findings reveal a novel role for the MCH system as a mediator of the role of oxytocin in regulating marble-burying behavior in mice.",28888943,2018,Melanin concentrating hormone modulates oxytocin-mediated marble burying.

Irradiation of a solution containing Ir-X+, TiO2/ReP particles, and an electron donor (1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazole) in N,N-dimethylformamide at greater than 400 nm resulted in the reduction of CO2 to CO with efficiencies in the order X = OMe > tBu ≈ Me > H; Ir-CN+ has no photosensitization effect. A notable observation is that Ir-tBu+ and Ir-Me+ are less efficient than Ir-OMe+ at an early stage of the reaction but reveal persistent photosensitization behavior for a much longer period of time unlike the latter. Comparable experiments showed that (1) the Ir-X+ sensitizers are commonly superior compared to Ru(bpy)32+, a widely used transition-metal photosensitizer, and (2) the system comprising Ir-OMe+ and TiO2/ReP is much more efficient than a homogeneous-solution system using Ir-OMe+ and Re(4,4'-Y'2-bpy)(CO)3Cl (Y' = CH2PO(OEt)2).

Although highly heritable, much of the genetic liability of schizophrenia is yet to be explained. We searched for susceptibility loci in multiplex, multigenerational families affected by schizophrenia, targeting protein-altering variation with in silico predicted functional effects. Exome sequencing was performed on 136 samples from eight European-American families, including 23 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In total, 11,878 non-synonymous variants from 6,396 genes were tested for their association with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Pathway enrichment analyses were conducted on gene-based test results, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and epistatic effects. Using a significance threshold of FDR < 0.1, association was detected for rs10941112 (p = 2.1 × 10-5 ; q-value = 0.073) in AMACR, a gene involved in fatty acid metabolism and previously implicated in schizophrenia, with significant cis effects on gene expression (p = 5.5 × 10-4 ), including brain tissue data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (minimum p = 6.0 × 10-5 ). A second SNP, rs10378 located in TMEM176A, also shows risk effects in the exome data (p = 2.8 × 10-5 ; q-value = 0.073). PPIs among our top gene-based association results (p < 0.05; n = 359 genes) reveal significant enrichment of genes involved in NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth (p = 3.0 × 10-5 ), while exome-wide SNP-SNP interaction effects for rs10941112 and rs10378 indicate a potential role for kinase-mediated signaling involved in memory and learning.

Of practical relevance is that scheduled testing is ineffective for identifying drug misuse. Of ethical relevance is that consequences of positive scheduled tests can be unpredictable-in the form of overly severe punishment or a lack of treatment options-and that the scheduled testing paradigm is a poor way to change behaviors. More innovative programs now use a UDT paradigm with more frequent, random testing providing rapid results and certain, swift consequences and addiction treatment when warranted or requested.

Although DA dysregulation is the hallmark of MA-induced neurotoxicity leading to behavioral and cognitive deficits, the intermediary role of TAAR1 has yet to be characterized. To investigate TAAR1 regulation of MA-induced neurotoxicity, Taar1 transgenic knock-out (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice were administered saline or a neurotoxic regimen of 4 i.p. injections, 2h apart, of MA (2.5, 5, or 10mg/kg). Temperature data were recorded during the treatment day. Additionally, striatal tissue was collected 2 or 7days following MA administration for analysis of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. MA elicited an acute hypothermic drop in body temperature in Taar1-WT mice, but not in Taar1-KO mice. Two days following treatment, DA and TH levels were lower in Taar1-KO mice compared to Taar1-WT mice, regardless of treatment, and were dose-dependently decreased by MA. GFAP expression was significantly increased by all doses of MA at both time points and greater in Taar1-KO compared to Taar1-WT mice receiving MA 2.5 or 5mg/kg. Seven days later, DA levels were decreased in a similar pattern: DA was significantly lower in Taar1-KO compared to Taar1-WT mice receiving MA 2.5 or 5mg/kg. TH levels were uniformly decreased by MA, regardless of genotype. These results indicate that activation of TAAR1 potentiates MA-induced hypothermia and TAAR1 confers sustained neuroprotection dependent on its thermoregulatory effects.",28919515,2017,Trace amine-associated receptor 1 regulation of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
1022,"BACKGROUND
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous condition for which multiple efforts to characterize brain state differences are underway. The objective of this study was to identify distinct subgroups of resting electroencephalography (EEG) profiles among children with and without ADHD and subsequently provide extensive clinical characterization of the subgroups.


METHODS
Latent class analysis was used with resting state EEG recorded from a large sample of 781 children with and without ADHD (N = 620 ADHD, N = 161 Control), aged 6-18 years old. Behavioral and cognitive characteristics of the latent classes were derived from semistructured diagnostic interviews, parent completed behavior rating scales, and cognitive test performance.


RESULTS
A five-class solution was the best fit for the data, of which four classes had a defining spectral power elevation. The distribution of ADHD and control subjects was similar across classes suggesting there is no one resting state EEG profile for children with or without ADHD. Specific latent classes demonstrated distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles. Those with elevated slow-wave activity (i.e. delta and theta band) had higher levels of externalizing behaviors and cognitive deficits. Latent subgroups with elevated alpha and beta power had higher levels of internalizing behaviors, emotion dysregulation, and intact cognitive functioning.

There is population-level heterogeneity in resting state EEG subgroups, which are associated with distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles.

We observed a strong PRP effect together with a small crosstalk effect in the individual dual-task condition, but in the shared dual-task condition both effects were absent. These findings suggest that the explicit instruction to perform responses in a fixed order is necessary to obtain the social PRP effect. In the individual dual-task condition, sequential processing can be seen as a means to reduce or prevent crosstalk effects, which is not necessary in the shared dual-task condition.",28922997,2017,How Social and Refractory Is the Social Psychological Refractory Period?

Psychological distance between the decision maker and the recipient was manipulated by having participants make decisions for themselves, their friend, and another unknown participant. Risk preferences were closer to neutrality (i.e., more consistent with expected value) when making decisions on behalf of another participant than when making decisions for themselves or a friend.

The crystal structure of the latter phase was determined using powder X-ray diffraction data. A structural model was refined in the orthorhombic Fddd space group that resulted in cell dimensions of a = 5.84337 (7) Å, b = 8.33995 (9) Å, and c = 17.6237 (2) Å.

Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility reveals an AFM transition below ∼2 K along with a ZFC/FC divergence suggestive of spin freezing. The Curie-Weiss fitting parameters to the paramagnetic regime result in θ = -124 (1) K, which is indicative of predominant AFM interactions. A frustration index of ∼62 is in accordance with a highly frustrated magnetic ground state. Zero field (ZF) μSR data provides evidence for the onset of magnetic order below 4 K, along with the evidence for dynamical fluctuations up to 5 K. Moreover, longitudinal field (LF) μSR data reveals a complete decoupling in applied field at 2 K, which is indicative of static order in most or all of the volume fraction at ∼2 K, with partial ordered volumes coexisting with dynamical fluctuations up to 5 K.

A number of other Im derivatives were also investigated. 4(5)-methyl-imidazole forms a [Cu(acac)2(Im-3)n=2] trans-equatorial adduct, whereas the bulkier 2-methyl-imidazole (Im-2) and benzimidazole (Im-4) form the [Cu(acac)2(Im-2,4)n=1] monoadduct only. Our data therefore show that subtle changes in the substrate structure lead to controllable changes in coordination behavior, which could in turn lead to rational design of complexes for use in catalysis, imaging, and medicine.",28933856,2017,"Understanding the Coordination Modes of [Cu(acac)2(imidazole)n=1,2] Adducts by EPR, ENDOR, HYSCORE, and DFT Analysis."
1030,"BACKGROUND
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants until the early 2000s, mainly in home furnishings and electronics. The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2',4,4',5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2',4,4',-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans.


METHODS
Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3μM CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3μM BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20μM BDE-99 from 5 until 120h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance.


RESULTS
In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3μM CPF and 0.1μM BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3μM causing hyperactivity and 1μM or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test.


DISCUSSION
We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected.",28935585,2017,"Developmental exposure to low concentrations of two brominated flame retardants, BDE-47 and BDE-99, causes life-long behavioral alterations in zebrafish."

1032,"Structural properties of a quadruple perovskite BiMn7O12 were investigated by laboratory and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction between 10 and 650 K, single-crystal X-ray diffraction at room temperature, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), second-harmonic generation, and first-principles calculations. Three structural transitions were found. Above T1 = 608 K, BiMn7O12 crystallizes in a parent cubic structure with space group Im3̅. Between 460 and 608 K, BiMn7O12 adopts a monoclinic symmetry with pseudo-orthorhombic metrics (denoted as I2/m(o)), and orbital order appears below T1. Below T2 = 460 K, BiMn7O12 is likely to exhibit a transition to space group Im. Finally, below about T3 = 290 K, a triclinic distortion takes place to space group P1. Structural analyses of BiMn7O12 are very challenging because of severe twinning in single crystals and anisotropic broadening and diffuse scattering in powder. First-principles calculations confirm that noncentrosymmetric structures are more stable than centrosymmetric ones. The energy difference between the Im and P1 models is very small, and this fact can explain why the Im to P1 transition is very gradual, and there are no DSC anomalies associated with this transition. The structural behavior of BiMn7O12 is in striking contrast with that of LaMn7O12 and could be caused by effects of the Bi3+ lone electron pair.",28949543,2017,Complex Structural Behavior of BiMn7O12 Quadruple Perovskite.

1034,We investigate the behavior of a spherical cavity in a soft biological tissue modeled as a deformable porous material during an injection of non-Newtonian fluid that follows a power law model. Fluid flows into the neighboring tissue due to high cavity pressure where it is absorbed by capillaries and lymphatics at a rate proportional to the local pressure. Power law fluid pressure and displacement of a solid in the tissue are computed as function of radial distance and time. Numerical solutions indicate that shear thickening fluids exhibit less fluid pressure and induce small solid deformation as compared to shear thinning fluids. Absorption in the biological tissue increases as a consequence of flow-induced deformation for power law fluids. In most cases non-Newtonian results are compared with the viscous fluid case to magnify the differences.,28956450,2017,Non-Newtonian flow-induced deformation from pressurized cavities in absorbing porous tissues.

1036,"OBJECTIVES
To (1) examine whether reducing discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability is an adaptive predictor of well-being, (2) investigate intrusion, awareness, optimism, and pessimism as determinants of reducing discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability, and (3) explore how goal progress is involved in reducing discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability during two major periods after a colorectal cancer diagnosis.


DESIGN
Prospective design.


METHODS
Newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients (n = 120) were interviewed three times: within a month, 7 months (treatment period), and 18 months (follow-up period) post-diagnosis. Data were analysed using multiple regressions.


RESULTS
Results showed that (1) reducing discrepancies enhances well-being, (2) optimism and pessimism are predictors of reducing discrepancies during the treatment period but not during the follow-up period, while intrusion and awareness do not predict reducing discrepancies in either period, and (3) goal progress is a predictor of reducing discrepancies during the follow-up period, but no evidence for a moderating or mediating role of goal progress in the relation between psychological characteristics and reducing discrepancies was found.


CONCLUSIONS
Reducing discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability could benefit colorectal cancer patients' well-being. Optimism, pessimism, and goal progress appear to influence cancer patients' ability to reduce discrepancies. Providing assistance in improving goal progress to those who are less optimistic and highly pessimistic may be a suitable training for cancer patients to prevent deterioration in well-being. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? More discrepancy between goal importance and goal attainability is associated with lower levels of well-being. People are able to change evaluations of importance and attainability, but it is unknown whether this positively impacts well-being. Underlying causes of differences in the extent to which discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability are reduced are unknown. What does this study add? This is the first study to show that reducing discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability is beneficial for well-being. This is the first study to show that optimism and pessimism are determinants of reducing discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability. Goal progress might be an effective target for interventions that aim to facilitate one's ability to reduce discrepancies between goal importance and goal attainability.",28960718,2018,"Reducing discrepancies of personal goals in the context of cancer: A longitudinal study on the relation with well-being, psychological characteristics, and goal progress."

The temperature dependence of the resistivity shows behavior consistent with a degenerate semiconductor/poor metal, and magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a high degree of frustration resulting from the two-dimensional nature of the structure.

A dual structure of all phonon modes revealed in Raman spectra is associated with metal cations of different types present in the spinel lattice sites. Mössbauer spectra of small NPs exhibit superparamagnetic behavior. However, the transition into the paramagnetic state occurs at a temperature that is unusually high for small particles (TN is about 240 K in the d = 4.5 nm NPs). The larger NPs with d > 20 nm do not exhibit superparamagnetic properties up to the Neel temperature. From the magnetic and Mössbauer data, the cation occupation of the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral [B] sites was determined (Fe0.75Ni0.25)[Ni0.75Cr1.25]O4. The saturation magnetization MS in the largest NPs is about (0.98-0.95) μB, which is more than twice higher the value in bulk ferrite (Fe)[CrNi]O4. At low temperatures the total magnetic moment of the ferrite coincides with the direction of the B-sublattice moment. In the NPs with d > 20 nm, the compensation of the magnetic moments of A- and B-sublattices was revealed at about Tcom = 360-365 K. This value significantly exceeds the point Tcom in bulk ferrites NiFexCr2-xO4 (about 315 K) with the similar Cr concentration. However, in the smaller NPs NiFe0.75Cr1.25O4 with d ≤ 11.7 nm, the compensation effect does not occur.

1043,"In many mammal species, androgen levels in males are elevated during periods of mating activity, often to facilitate aggressive behavior between males over access to fertile females. However, this pattern might be less obvious in species with a rather low male-male aggression rate, or in those that are not strictly seasonal breeders. A complex social structure, as well as additional social and environmental factors, might add more to the complexity. Here, we applied a non-invasive method to monitor fecal androgen metabolite (fAM) levels in free-ranging giraffe bulls over a period of months to examine longitudinal patterns of androgen metabolite concentrations in relation to observed male sexual behavior in different age classes. Giraffes are non-seasonal breeders, living in a fission-fusion social system and males show a roaming strategy to search for fertile females. Our results show that season has an impact on fAM levels in free-ranging giraffes, with respective steroid concentrations being higher in summer. In the presence of females, fAM levels of bulls are significantly higher compared to when found in all-male groups, with old adult bulls showing the highest fAM levels. In contrast, young adult bulls have overall slightly higher fAM levels compared to old adult bulls when residing in all male groups.

1044,"PURPOSE
The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence for the potential promise of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to increase physical activity among people with dementia (PWD).


METHODS
PsychINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched 01/01/2000-01/12/2016. Randomized controlled/quasi-randomized trials were included if they recruited people diagnosed/suspected to have dementia, used at least one BCT in the intervention arm, and had at least one follow-up measure of physical activity/adherence. Studies were appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool, and BCTs were coded using Michie et al., 2013, Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 46, 81. taxonomy. Intervention findings were narratively synthesized as either 'very promising', 'quite promising', or 'non-promising', and BCTs were judged as having potential promise if they featured in at least twice as many very/quite promising than non-promising interventions (as per Gardner et al., 2016, Health Psychology Review, 10, 89).


RESULTS
Nineteen articles from nine trials reported physical activity findings on behavioural outcomes (two very promising, one quite promising, and two non-promising) or intervention adherence (one quite promising and four non-promising). Thirteen BCTs were used across the interventions. While no BCT had potential promise to increase intervention adherence, three BCTs had potential promise for improving physical activity behaviour outcomes: goal setting (behaviour), social support (unspecified), and using a credible source.


CONCLUSIONS
Three BCTs have potential promise for use in future interventions to increase physical activity among PWD. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? While physical activity is a key lifestyle factor to enhance and maintain health and wellbeing amongst the general population, adults rarely participate in sufficient levels to obtain these benefits. Systematic reviews suggest that specific behaviour change techniques can increase physical activity, although one review suggested that self-regulatory techniques may be counterproductive when promoting physical activity among older people. Until now, no systematic review has been conducted to assess which behaviour change techniques may be associated with greater participation in physical activity among people with dementia. What does this study add? Interventions showed mixed promise for increasing physical activity and little effect on participant adherence. Goal setting (behaviour), social support (unspecified), and using a credible source are promising approaches. No technique showed promise for increasing adherence to physical activity interventions among people with dementia.",28980370,2018,Systematic review of behaviour change techniques to promote participation in physical activity among people with dementia.
1045,"OBJECTIVE
This study thus aims to test differences between patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regarding IBD symptomatology, cognitive fusion, and psychological and physical health, as well as to explore whether the maladaptive emotion regulation process of cognitive fusion longitudinally impacts on the baseline and evolution of these outcomes over a period of 18 months.


DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants include 116 IBD patients with a mean age of 36.76 (SD = 11.39) of both genders (69.83% females) that completed the self-report measures of interest in three different times, equally spaced 9 months apart, over a period of 18 months. Latent growth curve models were conducted using structural equation modelling to estimate the growth trajectory of the variables in study.


RESULTS
Inflammatory bowel disease symptomatology and cognitive fusion's levels were negatively associated with psychological health and physical health's baseline levels. Furthermore, IBD symptomatology did not influence the growth of psychological health, while cognitive fusion did (β = .30, p = .007). The same result was found for physical health (β = .26, p = .024). These findings indicate that individuals with higher levels of cognitive fusion present lower levels of psychological health and physical health that tend to further decrease over the time through the effects of this maladaptive emotion regulation process.


CONCLUSIONS
This study implies that it is of crucial importance to include psychotherapeutic interventions in the health care of patients with IBD. If successful, these interventions could represent decreases in the cost of IBD treatment and in the use of drugs with adverse side effects, in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life. Further implications for clinical and research work are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Research has demonstrated the impact of emotion regulation on both physical and mental health. Nevertheless, the longitudinal effects of the specific emotion regulation process of cognitive fusion on physical and psychological health have never been explored. Additionally, no study has yet examined the causal role of emotion regulation in evolution of physical health in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). What does this study add? Cognitive fusion longitudinally impacted on IBD patients' physical and mental health. These variables were measured over a period of 18 months.

Powder neutron diffraction brought information on both temperature evolution of crystallographic parameters and magnetic order at low temperatures. No structural change was observed in the investigated temperature range from 1.5 to 300 K. Weak magnetic peaks outside nuclear Bragg positions observed in solid solutions with 0.90 ≤ x ≤ 1.10 were described by the propagation vector k = (0.40 + δx, 0.60 + δy, 0), where δx ≈ 0.02 and δy ≈ 0.01. The magnetic structure of CeCu0.75Al3.25 consists of two components: an anti-ferromagnetic one described by the same k and a ferromagnetic one with k0 = (0, 0, 0) and magnetic moments lying within the tetragonal basal plane. The evolution of magnetic excitations as a function of Cu-Al concentration in CeCuxAl4-x was studied by inelastic neutron scattering. The measured spectra of CeCuAl3 and the solution with x = 0.95 point to a three-magnetic-peak energy scheme, while only two excitations are expected from the local symmetry conditions on Ce atoms. The standard two-peak spectrum of crystal electric field excitations was observed for Cu-Al substitutions further from the 1:1:3 stoichiometry (x = 0.75 and 1.10). The intermediate concentrations (x = 0.90 and 1.05) exhibit spectra on the border between the former cases with a less clear pronounced first inelastic magnetic peak.

1050,"We previously mapped loci for the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genome-wide gene-by-alcohol dependence interaction (GW-GxAD) analyses of risky sexual behaviors (RSB). This study extends those findings by analyzing the ancestry- and sex-specific AD-stratified effects on RSB. We examined the concordance of findings for the AD-stratified GWAS and the GW-GxAD analysis of RSB, with concordance defined as genome-wide significance in one analysis and at least nominal significance in the second analysis. A total of 2,173 African-American (AA) and 1,751 European-American (EA) subjects were investigated. Information regarding RSB (lifetime experiences of unprotected sex and multiple sexual partners) and DSM-IV diagnosis of lifetime AD were derived from the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). In our ancestry- and sex-specific analyses, we identified four independent genome-wide significant (GWS) loci (p < 5*10-8 ) and one suggestive locus (p < 6*10-8 ). In men, we observed a GWS signal in FAM162A (rs2002594, p = 4.96*10-8 ). In women, there was a suggestive locus in PLGRKT (rs3824435, p = 5.52*10-8 ). In AAs, there was a GWS signal in GRK5 (rs1316543, p = 1.25*10-9 ). In AA men, we observed an intergenic GWS signal (rs12898370, p = 4.49*10-8 ) near LINGO1. In EA men, there was a GWS signal in CCSER1 (rs62313897; p = 7.93*10-10 ).

1051,"Single-component white phosphors stand a good chance to serve in the next-generation high-power white light-emitting diodes. Because of low thermal stability and containing lanthanide ions with reduced valence state, most of reported phosphors usually suffer unstable color of lighting for practical packaging and comparably complex synthetic processes. In this work, we present a type of novel color-tunable blue-white-yellow-emitting MgIn2P4O14:Tm3+/Dy3+ phosphor with high thermal stability, which can be easily fabricated in air. Under UV excitation, the MgIn2P4O14:Tm0.02Dy0.03 white phosphor exhibits negligible thermal-quenching behavior, with a 99.5% intensity retention at 150 °C, relative to its initial value at room temperature. The phosphor host MgIn2P4O14 was synthesized and reported for the first time. MgIn2P4O14 crystallizes in the space group of C2/c (No. 15) with a novel layered structure built of alternate anionic and cationic layers. Its disordering structure, with Mg and In atoms co-occupying the same site, is believed to facilitate the energy transfer between rare-earth ions and benefit by sustaining the luminescence with increasing temperature. The measured absolute quantum yields of MgIn2P4O14:Dy0.04, MgIn2P4O14:Tm0.01Dy0.04, and MgIn2P4O14:Tm0.02Dy0.03 phosphors under the excitation of 351 nm ultraviolet radiation are 70.50%, 53.24%, and 52.31%, respectively.

1052,"f-element-bearing iodate compounds are a large family mostly synthesized by hydrothermal reactions starting with actinide/lanthanide ions and iodic acid or iodate salt. In this work, we introduce melting periodic acid flux as a new reaction medium and provide a safe way for single-crystal growth of a series of new f-element iodate compounds including UO2(IO3)2·H2O (1), UO2(IO3)2(H2O)·HIO3 (2), α-Th(IO3)2(NO3)(OH) (3), β-Th(IO3)2(NO3)(OH) (4), and (H3O)9Nd9(IO3)36·3HIO3 (5). The structures of these compounds deviate from those afforded from hydrothermal reactions. Specifically, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit pillared structures consisting of uranyl pentagonal bipyramids and iodate trigonal pyramids. Compounds 3 and 4 represent two new thorium iodate compounds that are constructed from subunits of thorium dimers. Compound 5 exhibits a flower-shaped trivalent lanthanide iodate structure with HIO3 molecules and H3O+ cations filled in the channels. The aliovalent replacement of f elements in 5 is available from a hydrothermal process, further generating compounds of Th2(IO3)8(H2O) (6) and Ce2(IO3)8(H2O) (7). The distinct absorption features are observed in isotypic compounds 5-7, where 7 shows typical semiconductor behavior with a band gap of 2.43 eV. Remarkably, noncentrosymmetric 1, 6, and 7 exhibit strong second-harmonic-generation efficiencies of 1.3, 3.2, and 9.2 times, respectively, that of the commercial material KH2PO4. Additionally, the temperature-dependent emission spectra of 1 and 2 were also collected showing typical emission features of uranyl units and a negative correlation between the intensities of the emissions with temperature. Clearly, the presented low-temperature melting inorganic acid flux synthesis would provide a facile and effective strategy to produce a large new family of structurally versatile and multifunctional f-element inorganic compounds.",28991439,2017,Mild Periodic Acid Flux and Hydrothermal Methods for the Synthesis of Crystalline f-Element-Bearing Iodate Compounds.
1053,"Research has indicated that as many as 10% to 15% of primary care patients have symptoms that are not well explained medically. These patients could be labeled as ""somatizers."" This study assessed the extent to which underlying psychological characteristics contribute to a person's level of somatization and service utilization. The Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale-Global Rating Method (SCORS-G; Stein, Hilsenroth, Slavin-Mulford, & Pinsker, 2011; Westen, 1995) was used to rate early memory narratives of 100 patients in a suburban primary care setting. Using principal axis factoring, the SCORS-G was divided into 2 components and these components (cognitive and affective) were used in subsequent analyses. The affective component was significantly negatively correlated with 2 measures of somatization and positively related to physician ratings of global health. The affective component also showed a trend toward significance on overnight hospital stays and patient-rated health. The cognitive component showed a trend toward significance with both measures of somatization, but it was not correlated with other measures of health. This study demonstrates the value of assessing underlying processes (via SCORS-G ratings of early memory narratives) that contribute to increased rates of somatization and health care utilization. Clinical implications for the relationship between affect and physical health are explored.",28991512,2018,The Use of the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale in a Primary Care Setting.
1054,"BACKGROUND
Few studies have examined factors that moderate the relationship between playing video games and adolescent psychological adjustment. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology in a sample of 441 11th and 12th grade students, while considering both gender and the social context (whether they played alone or with others).


METHODS
Participants (66% non-Hispanic White) were administered a survey (including measures of technology use and anxiety symptomatology) in school at baseline and one year later.


RESULTS
Both gender and the social context moderated the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology. Boys who played video games the most had the lowest levels of anxiety, whereas girls who played video games the most had the highest levels of anxiety. This relationship was exacerbated in the context of playing with others.


LIMITATIONS
Although the study has a number of strengths including the longitudinal design and the diverse sample, the study relied on self-report data. In addition, the sample was limited to adolescents residing in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Therefore, caution should be taken in regard to generalizing the results.

1055,"Research has long established the importance of individual health behaviors such as cigarette smoking for adult morbidity and mortality. However, we know little about how health behaviors cluster into health lifestyles among adolescents and young adults in the United States, or in turn, how such health lifestyles are associated with young adult health outcomes. This study establishes health lifestyles as distinct group phenomena at three developmental time points in a single cohort: late adolescence (ages 15-17), early adulthood (ages 20-24), and young adulthood (ages 26-31). We then identify the associations between these health lifestyles and young adult health outcomes. We use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents followed into adulthood, and latent class analysis and regression models. We uncover diverse health lifestyles among adolescents, early adults, and young adults; however, few individuals engaged in a consistently salubrious lifestyle at any developmental stage. People with less healthy lifestyles also tended to exhibit poorer health in young adulthood. Our results showed that young adult health lifestyles were significantly associated with young adult cardiovascular risk. Moreover, health lifestyles in each of the three developmental stages were associated with young adult self-rated health, and accounting for lifestyles in later stages explained some of these associations. Overall, this study suggests a portrait of problematic health lifestyles among a nationally representative cohort of young Americans, with associated patterns of relatively poor physical health among those with poor health lifestyles.",28992538,2017,Health lifestyles across the transition to adulthood: Implications for health.
1056,"OBJECTIVES
Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with elevated reward sensitivity and persistent positive affect, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these patterns are not well understood. In the present study, we examined putative disruptions in communication within a well-known cortico-limbic reward circuit during reward processing as a potential contributing mechanism to these symptoms.


METHODS
The present investigation employed a within- and between-subjects design utilizing a monetary and social incentive delay task among adults with bipolar disorder type I (BD; N = 24) and a healthy non-psychiatric control group (HC; N = 25) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants in the BD group were remitted at the time of testing.


RESULTS
Functional connectivity analyses revealed increased connectivity between the ventral striatum (VS) seed region and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as well as the amygdala during processing of reward receipt in the BD group. After omission of expected rewards, the BD group showed decreased functional connectivity between the VS and a medial frontopolar cortex (mFPC) region associated with consideration of behavioral alternatives. Follow-up analyses within the BD group showed that increased VS-OFC connectivity after reward receipt, and decreased VS-mFPC connected after reward omission, were associated with higher levels of subthreshold mania symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Results point toward potential mechanisms implicated in elevated reward sensitivity in BD. Enhanced VS-OFC connectivity after reward receipt may be involved in elevated valuation of rewards whereas blunted VS-mFPC connectivity after reward omission may reflect a failure to consider behavioral alternatives to reward pursuit.",29024194,2017,Disrupted cortico-limbic connectivity during reward processing in remitted bipolar I disorder.

1058,"In this paper, we proposed a number rule for 3d-4f and 4f cyclic coordination cages (CCCs); that is, CCCs consisting of vertex-sharing M4(μ3-OH)4 (M = 3d transition metal or 4f lanthanide ions) units should have 3 × n metal centers (abbreviated M3n), where n represents the number of the M4(μ3-OH)4 subunits. Under this number rule we reasoned that some species of CCCs, for example, the pentadecanuclear 3d-4f wheel and the pure 4f wheels with 9 or 18 centers, should practically have existed. However, there are no such complexes reported in the literature. To realize such CCCs we employed a mixed-ligand approach, that is, to simultaneously use the primary and the ancillary ligands for syntheses. This approach successfully leads to the isolation of two families of CCCs, namely, the Ni10Ln5 (Ln = Gd and Y) mixed-metal wheels and the Er3n (n = 4, 5, and 6) pure 4f metal wheels. These two families of CCCs unambiguously fill the missing links of the M3n prototype CCCs. Moreover, dominated ferromagnetic interaction indicates high ground-spin state for the Gd5Ni10 wheel. The ferromagnetic interactions between the nickel centers are verified using the diamagnetic Y(III) analogue, which reveals an averaged coupling constant (J = 2.7 cm-1), while accompanied by a large negative zero-field splitting parameter (D = -6.1 cm-1) for single Ni(II) ions. Interestingly, the Y(III)-diluted Er12 wheel shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior, presumably indicating the magnetically anisotropic nature of the erbium(III) ions.",29035052,2017,"Filling the Missing Links of M3n Prototype 3d-4f and 4f Cyclic Coordination Cages: Syntheses, Structures, and Magnetic Properties of the Ni10Ln5 and the Er3n Wheels."
1059,"Fire can influence the microclimate of forest habitats by removing understory vegetation and surface debris. Temperature is often higher in recently burned forests owing to increased light penetration through the open understory. Because physiological processes are sensitive to temperature in ectotherms, we expected fire-maintained forests to improve the suitability of the thermal environment for turtles, and for turtles to seasonally associate with the most thermally-optimal habitats. Using a laboratory thermal gradient, we determined the thermal preference range (Tset) of eastern box turtles, Terrapene carolina, to be 27-31°C. Physical models simulating the body temperatures experienced by turtles in the field revealed that surface environments in a fire-maintained longleaf pine forest were 3°C warmer than adjacent unburned mixed hardwood/pine forests, but the fire-maintained forest was never of superior thermal quality owing to wider Te fluctuations above Tset and exposure to extreme and potentially lethal temperatures. Radiotracked turtles using fire-managed longleaf pine forests maintained shell temperatures (Ts) approximately 2°C above those at a nearby unburned forest, but we observed only moderate seasonal changes in habitat use which were inconsistent with thermoregulatory behavior. We conclude that turtles were not responding strongly to the thermal heterogeneity generated by fire in our system, and that other aspects of the environment are likely more important in shaping habitat associations.",29037402,2017,Thermal biology of eastern box turtles in a longleaf pine system managed with prescribed fire.

1061,"OBJECTIVE
Previously, we proposed long-range optical coherence tomography (LR-OCT) to be an effective method for the quantitative evaluation of the nasal valve geometry. Here, the objective was to quantify the reduction in the internal nasal valve angle and cross-sectional area that results in subjective nasal airway obstruction and to evaluate the dynamic behavior of the valve during respiration using LR-OCT.


METHODS
For 16 healthy individuals, LR-OCT was performed in each naris during: 1) normal respiration, 2) peak forced inspiration, 3) lateral nasal wall depression (to the onset of obstructive symptoms), and 4) after application of a topical decongestant. The angle and the cross-sectional area of the valve were measured.


RESULTS
A reduction of the valve angle from 18.3° to 14.1° (11° in Caucasians and 17° in Asians) and a decrease of the cross-sectional area from 0.65 cm2 to 0.55 cm2 led to subjective nasal obstruction. Forceful breathing did not significantly change the internal nasal valve area in healthy individuals. Application of nasal decongestant resulted in increased values.


CONCLUSION
LR-OCT proved to be a fast and readily performed method for the evaluation of the dynamic behavior of the nasal valve. The values of the angle and the cross-sectional area of the valve were reproducible, and changes in size could be accurately delineated.

Notably, the solubilization of tea toward Hpica and the solubilization of Hpica toward RE cations in the reaction system play an important role in the formation of 1-5. The most significant feature of 1-5 consists of an intriguing tetrameric [RE2(H2O)4(pica)2W2O5][(RE(H2O)W2(Hpica)2O4)(B-β-TeW8O30H2)2]24- polyoxoanion constructed from two tetravacant Keggin sandwich-type [(RE(H2O)W2(Hpica)2O4)(B-β-TeW8O30H2)2]5- entities linked by a RE-W-Hpica {RE2(H2O)4(pica)2W2O5}6+ cluster, in which Hpica ligands not only play a key bridging role in linking RE and W centers by carboxylic groups in an irregular N-O-RE-O-W-O six-membered-ring motif but also can directly chelate with W centers via N and O atoms in a stable N-O-C-O-W five-membered-ring fashion. 1-5 represent rare organic-inorganic hybrid RE-substituted tellurotungstates.

1064,"Understanding the origin of cooperativity and the equilibrium temperature of transition (T1/2) displayed by the spin-crossover (SCO) compounds as well as controlling these parameters are of paramount importance for future applications. For this task, the occurrence of polymorphism, presented by a number of SCO complexes, may provide deep insight into the influence of the supramolecular organization on the SCO behavior. In this context, herein we present a novel family of mononuclear octahedral FeII complexes with formula cis-[Fe(bqen)(NCX)2], where bqen is the chelating tetradentate ligand N,N'-bis(8-quinolyl)ethane-1,2-diamine and X = S, Se. Depending on the preparation method, these compounds crystallize in either the orthorhombic or the trigonal symmetry systems. While the orthorhombic phase is composed of a racemic mixture of mononuclear complexes (polymorph I), the trigonal phase contains only one of the two possible enantiomers (Λ or Δ), thereby generating a chiral crystal (polymorph II). The four derivatives undergo SCO behavior with well-differentiated T1/2 values occurring in the interval 90-233 K. On one hand, T1/2 is about 110 K (polymorph I) and 87 K (polymorph II) higher for the selenocyanate derivatives in comparison to those for their thiocyanate counterparts. These differences in T1/2 are ascribed not only to the higher ligand field induced by the selenocyanate anion but also to a remarkable difference in the structural reorganization of the [FeN6] coordination core upon SCO. Likewise, the higher cooperativity observed for the thiocyanate derivatives seems to be related to their stronger intermolecular interactions within the crystal. On the other hand, T1/2 is about 53 K (thiocyanate) and 29 K (selenocyanate) higher for the trigonal polymorph II in comparison to those for the orthorhombic polymorph I. These differences, and the small changes observed in cooperativity, stem from the slightly different hetero- and homochiral crystal packing generated by the cis-[Fe(bqen)(NCX)2] molecules, which determines subtle adaptations in the intermolecular contacts and the FeII coordination core.",29048915,2017,Chiral and Racemic Spin Crossover Polymorphs in a Family of Mononuclear Iron(II) Compounds.
1065,"Biofabrication of cell supportive cardiac patches that can be directly implanted on myocardial infarct is a potential solution for myocardial infarction repair. Ideally, cardiac patches should be able to mimic myocardium extracellular matrix for rapid integration with the host tissue, raising the need to develop cardiac constructs with complex features. In particular, cardiac patches should be electrically conductive, mechanically robust and elastic, biologically active and prevascularized. In this study, we aim to biofabricate a nanoreinforced hybrid cardiac patch laden with human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) with improved electrical, mechanical, and biological behavior. A safe ultraviolet (UV) exposure time with insignificant effect on cell viability was identified for methacrylated collagen (MeCol) micropatterning. The effects of carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on MeCol and alginate matrix morphology, mechanical properties, electrical behavior, and cellular response were investigated at different CNT mass ratios. A UV-integrated 3D-bioprinting technique was implemented to create hybrid hydrogel constructs consisting of CNT-incorporated alginate framework and cell-laden MeCol. The compressive modulus, impedance, and swelling degree of hybrid constructs were assessed over 20 days of incubation in culture medium at 37°C for different CNT mass ratios. The HCAEC viability, proliferation, and differentiation in the context of the bioprinted hybrid constructs were assessed over 10 days in vitro. The functionalized CNTs provided a highly interconnected nanofibrous meshwork that significantly improved viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of photo-cross-linked MeCol. Alginate-coated CNTs provided a nanofilamentous network with fiber size of ∼25-500 nm, improving not only electrical and mechanical properties but also HCAEC attachment and elongation compared to pristine alginate. The CNT-reinforced 3D-printed hybrid constructs presented significantly higher stiffness and electrical conductivity particularly in the physiologically relevant frequency range (∼5 Hz). The CNT-reinforced hybrid implants maintained a significantly higher swelling degree over 20 days of culturing compared to CNT-free hybrid constructs. For a selected CNT mass ratio, HCAECs presented significant cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (lumen-like formation) over 10 days of incubation in vitro.

Further, these coping styles appear to correlate directly with the strength of the physiological stress response exhibited by those individuals. In our study system, white laying hens are reactive, flighty, and exhibit large hormonal and behavioral responses to acute stress, while brown laying hens are proactive, exploratory, and exhibit low hormonal and behavioral responses to acute stress. The objective of the current study was to determine if personality type also corresponds to differences in multiple measures of stress when birds are subjected to a chronic stressor. We tested the responses of hens to chronic stress applied by providing feed according to an unpredictable schedule for 14 days, and measured corticosterone concentrations in circulation, expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), molecules known to protect cells in response to stress, and the ratios of heterophils:lymphocytes in blood, two immune cells known to change in quantity in circulation during chronic stress. We predicted that white hens would show greater physiological responses to the chronic stress treatment. Plasma corticosterone levels significantly increased after 7 days of treatment and returned to baseline levels on day 14, but did not differ significantly between strains. H:L ratios, on the other hand, were significantly elevated by day 7 of treatment, and increased significantly more in brown hens than white. HSP70 and HSP90 expression levels were significantly higher after stress began in white hens than brown. Our results showed that brown hens were more reactive in one response (H:L ratios) while white hens were more reactive in another (HSP expression).

The coupled substitution Cu/Fe in the Cu26-xFe4+xGe4S32 series also appears as a promising approach to optimize the thermoelectric properties. The electrical resistivity, which decreases slightly as the temperature increases, shows that these materials exhibit a semiconducting behavior, but are at the border of a metallic state. The magnitudes of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient increase with x, which suggests that Fe for Cu substitution decreases the hole concentration. The thermal conductivity decreases as the temperature increases leading to a moderately low value of 1.2 W m-1 K-1 and a maximum ZT value of 0.17 at 575 K.",29052982,2017,Designing a Thermoelectric Copper-Rich Sulfide from a Natural Mineral: Synthetic Germanite Cu22Fe8Ge4S32.
1069,"The four new Ag(I) complexes Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (1), Ag(idmp)(P2-nCB) (2), Ag(dmp)(P2-nCB) (3), and Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (4) with P2-nCB = bis(diphenylphosphine)-nido-carborane, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, idmp = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, dmp = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, and dbp = 2,9-di-n-butyl-1,10-phenanthroline were designed to demonstrate how to develop Ag(I) complexes that exhibit highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The substituents on the 1,10-phenanthroline ligand affect the photophysical properties strongly (i) electronically via influencing the radiative rate of the S1 → S0 transition and (ii) structurally by rigidifying the molecular geometry with respect to geometry changes occurring in the lowest excited S1 and T1 states. The oscillator strength of the S1 ↔ S0 transition f(S1 ↔ S0)-an important parameter for the TADF efficiency being proportional to the radiative rate-can be increased from f(S1 ↔ S0) = 0.0258 for Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (1) to f(S1 ↔ S0) = 0.0536 for Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (4), as calculated for the T1 state optimized geometries. This parameter governs the radiative TADF decay time (τr) at ambient temperature, found to be τr = 5.6 μs for Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (1) but only τr = 1.4 μs for Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (4)-a record TADF value. In parallel, the photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦPL) measured for powder samples at ambient temperature is boosted up from ΦPL = 36% for Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (1) to ΦPL = 100% for Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (4). This is a consequence of a cooperative effect of both decreasing the nonradiative decay rate and increasing the radiative decay rate in the series from Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (1), Ag(idmp)(P2-nCB) (2), and Ag(dmp)(P2-nCB) (3) to Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (4). Another parameter important for the TADF behavior is the activation energy of the S1 state from the state T1, ΔE(S1-T1).

1070,"Enhanced afferent excitability is considered to be an important pathophysiological basis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). In addition, transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors are known to be involved in afferent sensitization. Animals with hydrogen peroxide (HP)-induced cystitis have been used as a model exhibiting pathologic characteristics of chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder. This study investigated the effect of gene therapy with replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors encoding poreless TRPV1 (PL) or protein phosphatase 1 α (PP1α), a negative regulator of TRPV1, using a HP-induced rat model of cystitis. HSV vectors encoding green fluorescent protein, PL or PP1α were inoculated into the bladder wall of female rats. After 1 week, 1% HP or normal saline was administered into the bladder, and the evaluations were performed 2 weeks after viral inoculation. In HP-induced cystitis rats, gene delivery of PL or PP1α decreased pain behavior as well as a reduction in the intercontraction interval. Also, both treatments reduced nerve growth factor expression in the bladder mucosa, reduced bladder inflammation characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells and increased bladder weight. Taken together, HSV-mediated gene therapy targeting TRPV1 receptors could be effective for the treatment of IC/BPS.",29057994,2018,Effects of herpes simplex virus vectors encoding poreless TRPV1 or protein phosphatase 1α in a rat cystitis model induced by hydrogen peroxide.

In older children and adults, stress biomarkers, such as cortisol and C-reactive protein, increase when they do not practice healthy sleep habits. However, little is known about the relationships among sleep health, stress, and health outcomes among very young children living with socioeconomic adversity, a group that is particularly at risk for poor future health. The NIH-funded study described in this protocol addresses this scientific gap to improve understanding of these relationships during a critical developmental period in children's lives-toddlerhood. We will use a longitudinal design with repeated measures to prospectively examine the relationships among sleep health, stress, and toddlers' health from age 12 to 24 months, to address the following aims: i) examine changes in subjective and objective sleep health measures; ii) examine changes in stress biomarkers; iii) examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep health measures and stress response; and iv) examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep health measures, stress biomarkers, and toddlers' behavioral health. The sample will include 113 toddlers and their caregivers. We are collecting subjective and objective data on sleep health, multi-systemic biomarkers of stress, and toddlers' behavioral health.

1073,"Eph receptors and their corresponding ephrin ligands have been associated with regulating cell-cell adhesion and motility, and thus have a critical role in various biological processes including tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis, as well as pathogenesis of several diseases. Aberrant regulation of Eph/ephrin signaling pathways is implicated in tumor progression of various human cancers. Here, we show that a Rho family GTPase regulator, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 1 (RhoGDI1), can interact with ephrinB1, and this interaction is enhanced upon binding the extracellular domain of the cognate EphB2 receptor. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that amino acids 327-334 of the ephrinB1 intracellular domain are critical for the interaction with RhoGDI1. Stimulation with an EphB2 extracellular domain-Fc fusion protein (EphB2-Fc) induces RhoA activation and enhances the motility as well as invasiveness of wild-type ephrinB1-expressing cells. These Eph-Fc-induced effects were markedly diminished in cells expressing the mutant ephrinB1 construct (Δ327-334) that is ineffective at interacting with RhoGDI1. Furthermore, ephrinB1 depletion by siRNA suppresses EphB2-Fc-induced RhoA activation, and reduces motility and invasiveness of the SW480 and Hs578T human cancer cell lines. Our study connects the interaction between RhoGDI1 and ephrinB1 to the promotion of cancer cell behavior associated with tumor progression.

The alloys were prepared by high-energy ball milling using elemental Ti, Al, Fe, and Cu powders and consolidated by a uniaxial vacuum hot press. Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 29213 and Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 were used to determine the antibacterial properties of the sintered alloys. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the samples was evaluated with HeLa (ATTC, CCL-2) cells using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide. The mechanical behavior of the samples was determined as a function of hardness and bending tests and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, optical microscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the Cu content significantly improved the antibacterial properties. Cu addition prevented the formation of E. coli and S. aureus colonies on the surface of the samples.

1076,"The effects of indoor air pollution on human health have drawn increasing attention among the scientific community as individuals spend most of their time indoors. However, indoor air sampling is labor-intensive and costly, which limits the ability to study the adverse health effects related to indoor air pollutants. To overcome this challenge, many researchers have attempted to predict indoor exposures based on outdoor pollutant concentrations, home characteristics, and weather parameters. Typically, these models require knowledge of the infiltration factor, which indicates the fraction of ambient particles that penetrates indoors. For estimating indoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, a common approach is to use the indoor-to-outdoor sulfur ratio (Sindoor/Soutdoor) as a proxy of the infiltration factor. The objective of this study was to develop a robust model that estimates Sindoor/Soutdoor for individual households that can be incorporated into models to predict indoor PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) concentrations. Overall, our model adequately estimated Sindoor/Soutdoor with an out-of-sample by home-season R2 of 0.89. Estimated Sindoor/Soutdoor reflected behaviors that influence particle infiltration, including window opening, use of forced air heating, and air purifier.

On the basis of the high degree of structural flexibility and compatibility, diverse molecular functional materials have been assembled by modifying the length of the organic components and/or dimensionality of the inorganic frameworks. In this paper, we present a chiral lead-free organic-inorganic hybrid, (piperidinium)2SbCl5 (1), which follows the one-dimensional inorganic frameworks of the corner-sharing SbCl6 octahedra. Strikingly, 1 displays a dielectric phase transition at Tc = 338 K, changing from the chiral space group of P212121 to polar Pna21 upon heating. Crystal structure analyses reveal that an unusual thermally activated conformation change of the piperidinium cations affords the driving force to the phase transition of 1. That is, organic piperidinium moieties display a chairlike conformation below Tc, which transforms to a boatlike structure above Tc. Such an unprecedented change is strongly coupled to the dielectric transition along with notable steplike anomalies, which suggest that 1 could be used as a potential switchable dielectric material. Besides, the temperature-dependent conductivity and theoretical analysis of its electronic structure disclose the semiconducting behavior of 1.

1080,"Switching between tasks necessitates maintaining tasks in high readiness, yet readiness creates paradoxical interference from these tasks when they are not currently required. ""Optimal suppression"", which targets just the interfering information, provides a partial solution to this paradox. By examining the carryover of suppression of a competitor stimulus-response (S-R) set from Trial N - 1 to Trial N, Meiran, Hsieh  and colleagues (Meiran  et al., J Exp Psychol Learn mem cognit 36:992-1002, 2010; Cognit Affect Behav Neurosci 11:292-308, 2011, and Hsieh et al., Acta Psychol 141:316-321, 2012) found that only the competing stimulus-response (S-R) set of rules is suppressed. Specifically, they found that a competitor S-R set in Trial N - 1 incurs cost when it becomes the relevant set in Trial N [competitor becomes relevant (CbR)]. Extending this logic, we predicted performance benefit when the competitor S-R set in Trial N - 1 remains the competitor S-R set in Trial N [competitor remains competitor (CrC)]. Here, we examined the question of whether what is being suppressed when encountering a response conflict is the entire S-R set of rules (e.g., ""IF pink PRESS right"", and ""IF blue PRESS left"") or an even more specific representation, namely, the currently interfering S-R rule (e.g., just ""IF blue PRESS left""). We show that both CbR and CrC interact with Response (i.e., left or right key), suggesting that the system can recognize the exact source of interference (the competing S-R rule), and inhibit only this source.",29075843,2018,"""Optimal suppression"" as a solution to the paradoxical cost of multitasking: examination of suppression specificity in task switching."

1082,"Performance decrements in multitasking have been explained by limitations in cognitive capacity, either modelled as static structural bottlenecks or as the scarcity of overall cognitive resources that prevent humans, or at least restrict them, from processing two tasks at the same time. However, recent research has shown that individual differences, flexible resource allocation, and prioritization of tasks cannot be fully explained by these accounts. We argue that understanding human multitasking as a choice and examining multitasking performance from the perspective of judgment and decision-making (JDM), may complement current dual-task theories. We outline two prominent theories from the area of JDM, namely Simple Heuristics and the Decision Field Theory, and adapt these theories to multitasking research. Here, we explain how computational modelling techniques and decision-making parameters used in JDM may provide a benefit to understanding multitasking costs and argue that these techniques and parameters have the potential to predict multitasking behavior in general, and also individual differences in behavior. Finally, we present the one-reason choice metaphor to explain a flexible use of limited capacity as well as changes in serial and parallel task processing. Based on this newly combined approach, we outline a concrete interdisciplinary future research program that we think will help to further develop multitasking research.",29086021,2018,Multitasking as a choice: a perspective.

HR-XANES results show that the addition of excess Si3N4 is not sufficient for complete reduction of Pu to Pu(III), which has a relatively high solubility limit (9-22 wt % Pu) due to its network-modifying behavior in glasses. We provide evidence that the initially added Pu(VI) might be partly preserved during vitrification at 1200/1400 °C in Ar atmosphere.

Single-crystal XRD reveals that, except for 1, all complexes possess two crystallographically distinct molecules within the unit cell. Both of these crystallographically distinct molecules possess the same molecular formula, but the orientation of the coordinating ligand distinctly differs from those in complexes 2-5. Alternating-current magnetic susceptibility measurement reveals that complexes 1-3 exhibit slow relaxation of magnetization in the presence of an optimum external magnetic field. In contrast to 1-3, complex 4 shows a blockade of magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field, a signature characteristic of a single-ion magnet (SIM). The distinct magnetic behavior observed in 4 compared to other complexes is correlated to the suitable ligand field around a prolate ErIII ion. Although the ligand field stabilizes an easy axis of anisotropy, quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) is still predominant in 4 because of the low symmetry of the complex. The combination of low symmetry and an unsuitable ligand-field environment in complexes 1-3 triggers faster magnetization relaxation; hence, these complexes exhibit field-induced SIM behavior. In order to understand the electronic structures of complexes 1-4 and the distinct magnetic behavior observed, ab initio calculations were performed. Using the crystal structure of the complexes, magnetic susceptibility data were computed for all of the complexes. The computed susceptibility and magnetization are in good agreement with the experimental magnetic data [χMT(T) and M(H)] and this offers confidence on the reliability of the extracted parameters.

1086,"OBJECTIVE
The present research relies on 2 main objectives. The first is to investigate whether latent model analysis through a structural equation model can be implemented on driving simulator data in order to define an unobserved driving performance variable. Subsequently, the second objective is to investigate and quantify the effect of several risk factors including distraction sources, driver characteristics, and road and traffic environment on the overall driving performance and not in independent driving performance measures.


METHODS
For the scope of the present research, 95 participants from all age groups were asked to drive under different types of distraction (conversation with passenger, cell phone use) in urban and rural road environments with low and high traffic volume in a driving simulator experiment. Then, in the framework of the statistical analysis, a correlation table is presented investigating any of a broad class of statistical relationships between driving simulator measures and a structural equation model is developed in which overall driving performance is estimated as a latent variable based on several individual driving simulator measures.


RESULTS
Results confirm the suitability of the structural equation model and indicate that the selection of the specific performance measures that define overall performance should be guided by a rule of representativeness between the selected variables. Moreover, results indicate that conversation with the passenger was not found to have a statistically significant effect, indicating that drivers do not change their performance while conversing with a passenger compared to undistracted driving. On the other hand, results support the hypothesis that cell phone use has a negative effect on driving performance. Furthermore, regarding driver characteristics, age, gender, and experience all have a significant effect on driving performance, indicating that driver-related characteristics play the most crucial role in overall driving performance.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this study allow a new approach to the investigation of driving behavior in driving simulator experiments and in general. By the successful implementation of the structural equation model, driving behavior can be assessed in terms of overall performance and not through individual performance measures, which allows an important scientific step forward from piecemeal analyses to a sound combined analysis of the interrelationship between several risk factors and overall driving performance.",29087738,2017,Structural equation model analysis for the evaluation of overall driving performance: A driving simulator study focusing on driver distraction.
1087,"PURPOSE
The objectives of the study were to determine the extent to which trajectories of maternal preconception leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and leisure-time sedentary behavior (LTSB) during adolescence and young adulthood are associated with offspring birth weight (BW) and to test if these associations differ by offspring sex or maternal pre-pregnancy overweight-obese status.


METHODS
Participants with one or more birth (n = 1408) were identified from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to characterize trajectories of LTPA (frequency/week) and LTSB (hours/week) which were measured, on average, over 7 years between age 15 and 22 years. Weighted regression and Wald tests were used to estimate and test mean differences and odds ratios for BW, small for gestational age, and large for gestational age (LGA).


RESULTS
Three trajectories were identified for LTPA and five for LTSB. Associations differed by offspring sex for continuous BW and LGA (interaction P = .10 and .008, respectively). Among female offspring, participants with high followed by decreasing LTPA delivered offspring with 90 g greater BW (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4 to 184) and 72% greater risk of LGA (95% CI: 0.94-3.14), compared with participants with low LTPA. Among male offspring, LTPA patterns were not associated with BW. A pattern of high then decreasing LTPA among normal weight, but not overweight-obese women, was associated with 2.03 times greater risk of LGA (95% CI: 1.06-3.88). LTSB trajectories were not associated with BW.

1088,"Air oxidation of methanolic solutions of biologically active tridentate pyridyl thiosemicarbazone (TSC) complexes of the general formula [FeII(TSC)2] has been studied at varying dioxygen concentrations, temperatures, and pressures. The data collected indicate that the activation entropy of the reaction increases linearly with the redox potential of the complexes in a more definite way than the activation enthalpy. However, a very distinct behavior is observed for the values of the activation volumes, which do not follow the expected entropy-volume parallel trend for all of the systems studied. The involvement of important interactions between the terminal NH groups of the coordinated TSC ligand and molecular dioxygen has been found to be significant by measurements carried out at varying hydrostatic pressures. Kinetic experiments run on analogous N-deuterated complexes confirm the importance of these noncovalent interactions, which are weaker for the less acidic ND groups.

In 1, 2, and 3, the hexagonal holes of this network are occupied by Me2NH2+, Et2NH2+, or Et3NH+ cations. Interestingly, the small increase of size of the templating cation in 4 ([(Et)(i-Pr)2NH]+ in the place of Me2NH2+, Et2NH2+ or Et3NH+), gives rise to a different structure with half of the cations placed within the layers and the other one in the space between the layers. This leads to bilayers with an interlayer separation similar to those of 1, 2, and 3 separated by larger interbilayer distances. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 show a ferrimagnetic ordering with a Tc of 8.0 K (1), 8.9 K (2), and 8.0 K (3). In 4, the presence of different interlayer distances leads to a metamagnetic behavior when the sample is measured in contact with the mother liquor. The behavior changes in the dry sample, which shows a ferrimagnetic ordering as that of 1, 2, and 3 due to collapse of the structure as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction.

1091,"Two Cu(I) cluster based coordination polymers, [CuI(cis-bpype)]·CH3CN (1) and [Cu4I4(cis-bpype)3(trans-bpype)]·3DMF (2), have been synthesized from cis- and trans-1,2-bis(4-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)ethane (cis- and trans-bpype) ligands and {Cu4I4(PPh3)4} as starting materials. In compound 1, adjacent rhomboid-type {Cu2I2} units from the decomposition of {Cu4I4(PPh3)4} starting material connect by cis-bpype ligands to form a 1D framework. Compound 2 also has a 1D structure, but it has a {M2L3}-type coordinated cage constructed by three cis-bpype ligands and two {Cu4I4} secondary building units (SBU), and these coordination cages further link by trans-bpype to form the final frameworks. Upon cooling from 300 to 80 K, these Cu(I) cluster based coordination polymers exhibit interesting thermochromic behavior. In particular, compound 2 gives a chromic process from green luminescence at room temperature to red luminescence at 80 K and its corresponding CIE coordinates shift from green (0.34, 0.43) at 300 K to red (0.46, 0.42) at 80 K, respectively. This red shift of 124 nm (516 to 640 nm) is large enough to ensure a color change visible to the naked eye, which can be potentially utilized as a temperature sensor with a wide range.",29099185,2017,Stereochemically Dependent Synthesis of Two Cu(I) Cluster-Based Coordination Polymers with Thermochromic Luminescence.
1092,"BACKGROUND
Emergency departments (ED) are sites of prevalent imaging overuse; however, determinants that drive imaging in this setting are not well-characterized. We systematically reviewed the literature to summarize the determinants of imaging overuse in the ED.


METHODS
We searched MEDLINE® and Embase® from January 1998 to March 2017. Studies were included if they were written in English, contained original data, pertained to a U.S. population, and identified a determinant associated with overuse of imaging in the ED.


RESULTS
Twenty relevant studies were included. Fourteen evaluated computerized tomography (CT) scanning in patents presenting to a regional ED who were then transferred to a level 1 trauma center; incomplete transfer of data and poor image quality were the most frequently described reasons for repeat scanning. Unnecessary pre-transfer scanning or repeated scanning after transfer, in multiple studies, was highest among older patients, those with higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS) and those being transferred further. Six studies explored determinants of overused imaging in the ED in varied conditions, with overuse greater in older patients and those having more comorbid diseases. Defensive imaging reportedly influenced physician behavior. Less integration of services across the health system also predisposed to overuse of imaging.


CONCLUSIONS
The literature is heterogeneous with surprisingly few studies of determinants of imaging in minor head injury or of spine imaging. Older patient age and higher ISS were the most consistently associated with ED imaging overuse. This review highlights the need for precise definitions of overuse of imaging in the ED.",29100783,2018,Factors associated with imaging overuse in the emergency department: A systematic review.
1093,"BACKGROUND
Bariatric procedures are increasingly being used, but data on bowel habits are scarce.


OBJECTIVES
To assess changes in gastrointestinal function and patient-scored symptoms after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS).


SETTING
University hospital in Sweden.


METHODS
We recruited 268 adult patients (mean age of 42.5 yr, body mass index 44.8, 67.9% female) listed for RYGB and BPD/DS. Patients answered validated questionnaires prospectively concerning bowel function, the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey before and after their operation.


RESULTS
Postoperatively, 208 patients (78.2% of 266 eligible patients) answered the questionnaires. RYGB patients had fewer bowel motions per week (8 versus 10) and more abdominal pain postoperatively (P<.001). Postoperatively, the 35 BPD/DS patients (69% versus 23%) needed to empty their bowel twice or more than twice daily, reported more flatus and urgency, and increased need for keeping a diet (P<.001). Concerning Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale, coping and behavior was slightly reduced while depression and self-perception scores were improved after RYGB. Lifestyle, coping and behavior, and embarrassment were reduced after BPD/DS (P<.05). In the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, physical scores were markedly improved, while mental scores were largely unaffected.


CONCLUSION
RYGB resulted in a reduced number of bowel movements but increased problems with abdominal pain. In contrast, BPD/DS-patients reported higher frequency of bowel movements, more troubles with flatus and urgency, and increased need for keeping a diet. These symptoms affected quality of life negatively, however, general quality of life was markedly improved after both procedures. These results will be of great value for preoperative counseling.",29108895,2018,Changes in bowel habits and patient-scored symptoms after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch.
1094,"Molecular aggregation of bis(salicylaldiminato) ZnII Schiff base, ZnL, complexes is a topic of current interest. In this paper, we report a novel complex derived from the enantiopure trans-1,2-cyclopentanediamine, (R)-1, in order to probe the effect of the defined stereochemistry on its coordination geometry and aggregation properties, through detailed 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, UV/vis, and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies and accurate DFT calculations. This complex shows several peculiarities in solution, behaving very differently from ZnL complexes and more importantly from the related trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane derivative. Unexpectedly, experimental data suggest the existence in DMSO of two species in equilibrium, the classical monomeric adduct and a dimer, indicating that the DMSO is not sufficiently strong Lewis basic to completely deaggregate the complex. Also, in chloroform an unusual behavior is observed with the existence of a single defined dimeric species characterized as a dinuclear double helicate Zn2L2 structure which does not deaggregate even with the addition of pyridine in large stoichiometric excess. The formation of mononuclear adducts occurs only when dissolving the complex in the stronger Lewis base pyridine. All these data indicate the helicate (R)-1-h complex has a higher thermodynamic stability than that of the cyclohexane analogue, leading to its unique aggregation properties.",29112387,2017,"Aggregates of Defined Stereochemical Scaffolds: A Study in Solution of a Zinc(II) Schiff Base Complex Derived from the Enantiopure trans-1,2-Cyclopentanediamine."

Co atoms are found to enter into the apatite trigonal channel formally substituting H atoms and forming bent dioxocobaltate(II) anions. The anion exhibits single-molecule-magnet (SMM) behavior: slow relaxation of magnetization below 8 K under a nonzero magnetic field with an energy barrier of 63 cm-1. The barrier value does not depend on the concentration of Co ions, virtually coincides with the zero-field-splitting energy as determined from direct-current magnetization, and is very close to the value obtained earlier for cobalt-doped strontium hydroxyapatite. Moreover, the vibration frequencies of the dioxocobaltate(II) anion are found to be the same in calcium and strontium apatite matrixes. The very weak dependence of the SMM parameters on the matrix nature in combination with good chemical and thermal stabilities of the compounds provides wide opportunities to exploit the intrinsic properties of such a SMM-like anion.",29112812,2017,Slow Spin Relaxation in Dioxocobaltate(II) Anions Embedded in the Lattice of Calcium Hydroxyapatite.
1096,"Swimming and recreating in lakes, oceans, and rivers is common, yet the literature suggests children may be at greater risk of illness following such exposures. These effects might be due to differences in immunity or differing behavioral factors such as poorer hygiene, longer exposures to, and greater ingestion of potentially contaminated water and sand. We pooled data from 12 prospective cohorts (n=68,685) to examine exposures to potentially contaminated media such as beach water and sand among children compared with adults, and conducted a simulation using self-reported time spent in the water and volume of water swallowed per minute by age to estimate the total volume of water swallowed per swimming event by age category. Children aged 4-7 and 8-12 years had the highest exposures to water, sand, and algae compared with other age groups. Based on our simulation, we found that children (6-12 years) swallow a median of 36 ml (90th percentile=150 ml), whereas adults aged ≥35 years swallow 9 ml (90th percentile=64 ml) per swimming event, with male children swallowing a greater amount of water compared with females. These estimates may help to reduce uncertainty surrounding routes and durations of recreational exposures and can support the development of chemical and microbial risk assessments.",29115288,2018,"Child environmental exposures to water and sand at the beach: Findings from studies of over 68,000 subjects at 12 beaches."

The structural diversity found in the family of compounds derives from the coordination versatility of the ligand, which coordinates as a terminal ligand to give a supramolecular network of monomeric entities in 1 or acts as a bridging linker to build isoreticular 2D coordination polymers (CPs) in 2-4. Magnetic direct-current (dc) susceptibility data have been measured for compounds 1-3 to analyze the exchange interactions among paramagnetic centers, which have been indeed supported by calculations based on broken symmetry (BS) and density functional theory (DFT) methodology. The temperature dependence of susceptibility and magnetization data of 2 are indicative of easy-plane anisotropy (D = +12.9 cm-1, E = +0.5 cm-1) that involves a bistable Ms = ±1/2 ground state. Alternating-current (ac) susceptibility curves exhibit field-induced single-ion magnet (SIM) behavior that occurs below 14 K, which is characterized by two spin relaxation processes of distinct nature: fast relaxation of single ions proceeding through multiple mechanisms (Ueff = 26 K) and a slow relaxation attributed to interactions along the polymeric crystal building.

1099,"BACKGROUND
Obesity is regarded as a modern lifestyle problem, causing illness, stigma, discrimination, and psychological problems. To help patients avoid these problems, physiotherapists increasingly engage in lifestyle programs specialized in weight loss.


OBJECTIVE
To explore how physiotherapists' encounters with patients diagnosed as ""obese"" acquire significance for their development as clinicians.


METHOD
The material draws on semi-structured interviews with eight physiotherapists. We conducted a thematic analysis inspired by van Manen's hermeneutic-phenomenological approach combined with Kvale and Brinkman's critical approach.


FINDINGS
The analysis identified the following four themes: 1) Striving to find one's own style of communication; 2) Relating to bodily discrepancies; 3) Developing clinical competence through bodily encounters; and 4) Gaining insight into the dilemmas of group-based lifestyle programs. Taken together, our findings highlight bodily encounters between patients and physiotherapists as an invaluable source of insight. Such insight can shape physiotherapists' development as clinicians inspiring them to develop their unique ways of communicating so that patients diagnosed as obese can feel empowerment rather than failure and shame. At the same time, our findings point to the need of critically reflecting on ones' own approach entering a double role of both controller and supporter. As such, our findings complicate and extend previous work on stigma and shame.


CONCLUSION
Our research leads us to conclude that more emphasis on critical thinking in physiotherapy is necessary. We suggest that this should be given more priority in research, education, as well as in clinical practice.",29120260,2018,"Physiotherapists' encounters with ""obese"" patients: Exploring how embodied approaches gain significance."

1103,"Objective We sought to define and measure four types of perceived interruptions and to examine their relationships with stress outcomes. Background Interruptions have been defined and measured in a variety of inconsistent ways. No study has simultaneously examined the subjective experience of all types of interruptions. Method First, we provide a synthesized definition and model of interruptions that aligns interruptions along two qualities: origin and degree of multitasking. Second, we create and validate a self-report measure of these four types of perceived interruptions within two samples (working undergraduate students and working engineers). Last, we correlate this measure with self-reported psychological and physical stress outcomes. Results Our results support the four-factor model of interruptions. Results further support the link between each of the four types of interruptions (intrusions, breaks, distractions, and a specific type of ruminations, discrepancies) and stress outcomes. Specifically, results suggest that distractions explain a unique portion of variance in stress outcomes above and beyond the shared variance explained by intrusions, breaks, and discrepancies. Conclusion The synthesized four-factor model of interruptions is an adequate representation of the overall construct of interruptions. Further, perceived interruptions can be measured and are significantly related to stress outcomes. Application Measuring interruptions by observation can be intrusive and resource intensive. Additionally, some types of interruptions may be internal and therefore unobservable. Our survey measure offers a practical alternative method for practitioners and researchers interested in the outcomes of interruptions, especially stress outcomes.",29131659,2018,Stress Outcomes of Four Types of Perceived Interruptions.

1107,"OBJECTIVES
This study explored the mechanisms of physical activity (PA) compensation among older adults who recently reduced their non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) in response to a structured PA intervention.


DESIGN
A post-trial, retrospective qualitative process evaluation using interviews was employed.


METHODS
Levels of PA compensation were determined by comparing NEPA prior to and during the final week of a 4-week structured PA intervention. Those who reduced their NEPA by 10% or greater were considered as compensators. Interviews were conducted with older adult compensators (mean age = 58.56 ± 3.88 years; n = 9), employing thematic analysis to identify potential mechanisms of PA compensation.


RESULTS
The findings suggest that the majority of participants were unaware that they had compensated in their PA, suggesting that this may be a non-volitional process. Most participants perceived PA compensation to hold negative implications for health and well-being. Physiological processes of fatigue and delayed onset of muscle soreness were cited as the principal cause of PA compensation, whereas psychological processes including a drive to be inactive, fear of overexertion, deficient motivation, and perceived time constraints were cited to a lesser extent.


CONCLUSION
A range of physiological and psychological compensatory barriers were identified. Implications of and methods to overcome these compensatory barriers are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Physical activity compensation holds negative implications for physical activity promotion and health. Older adults are an age group more likely to compensate in their physical activity levels. What does this study add? Physical activity compensation may be a result of a range of physiological and psychological processes including fatigue and delayed onset of muscle soreness, compensatory health beliefs, fear of overexertion, deficient motivation, and perceived time constraints. Most older adult compensators may be unaware they are compensating and, however, agree that physical activity compensation has negative implications for health and well-being.",29171704,2018,A qualitative investigation of physical activity compensation among older adults.

Background Although an extensive literature on human-automation interaction exists, much less is known about HAT in which humans and autonomous agents interact as coordinated units. Further research must be conducted to better understand how all-human teams compare to HAT. Methods In an unmanned aerial system (UAS) context, a comparison was made among three types of three-member teams: (1) synthetic teams in which the pilot role is assigned to a synthetic teammate, (2) control teams in which the pilot was an inexperienced human, and (3) experimenter teams in which an experimenter served as an experienced pilot. Ten of each type of team participated. Measures of team performance, target processing efficiency, team situation awareness, and team verbal behaviors were analyzed. Results Synthetic teams performed as well at the mission level as control (all human) teams but processed targets less efficiently.

1116,"Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A. The simplest complete model of choice response time: linear ballistic accumulation. Cogn Psychol 2008, 57:153-178).

1117,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers contribute to the maintenance of colonies in various ways. The primary functions of workers are divided into two types depending on age: young workers (nurses) primarily engage in such behaviors as cleaning and food handling within the hive, whereas older workers (foragers) acquire floral nutrients beyond the colony. Concomitant with this age-dependent change in activity, physiological changes occur in the tissues and organs of workers. Nurses supply younger larvae with honey containing high levels of glucose and supply older larvae with honey containing high levels of fructose. Given that nurses must determine both the concentration and type of sugar used in honey, gustatory receptors (Gr) expressed in the chemosensory organs likely play a role in distinguishing between sugars. Glucose is recognized by Gr1 in honey bees (AmGr1); however, it remains unclear which Gr are responsible for fructose recognition. This study aimed to identify fructose receptors in honey bees and reported that AmGr3, when transiently expressed in Xenopus oocytes, responded only to fructose, and to no other sugars. We analyzed expression levels of AmGr3 to identify which tissues and organs of workers are involved in fructose recognition and determined that expression of AmGr3 was particularly high in the antennae and legs of nurses. Our results suggest that nurses use their antennae and legs to recognize fructose, and that AmGr3 functions as an accurate nutrient sensor used to maintain food quality in honey bee hives.",29194737,2018,Differential expression of a fructose receptor gene in honey bee workers according to age and behavioral role.

Patients with FCS frequently struggle to maintain normality in their lives as a consequence of the necessity to severely restrict their intake of dietary fat coupled with the constant threat of recurrent pancreatitis. Patients typically face a high level of psychological stress and anxiety in association with reduced measures of quality of life.

1119,"Sarcomas, and the mesenchymal precursor cells from which they arise, express chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (NG2/CSPG4). However, NG2/CSPG4's function and its capacity to serve as a therapeutic target in this tumor type are unknown. Here, we used cells from human tumors and a genetically engineered autochthonous mouse model of soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) to determine NG2/CSPG4's role in STS initiation and growth. Inhibiting NG2/CSPG4 expression in established murine and human STSs decreased tumor volume by almost two-thirds and cell proliferation rate by 50%. NG2/CSPG4 antibody immunotherapy in human sarcomas established as xenografts in mice similarly decreased tumor volume, and expression of a lentivirus blocking NG2/CSPG4 expression inhibited tumor cell proliferation and increased the latency of engraftment. Gene profiling showed that Ng2/Cspg4 deletion altered the expression of genes regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Surprisingly, Ng2/Cspg4 deletion at the time of tumor initiation resulted in larger tumors. Gene expression profiling indicated substantial down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (Igfbp) genes when Ng2/Cspg4 is depleted at tumor initiation, but not when Ng2/Cspg4 is depleted after tumor initiation. Such differences may have clinical significance, as therapeutic targeting of a signaling pathway such as NG2/CSPG4 may have different effects on cell behavior with tumor progression. NG2/CSPG4 depletion has divergent effects, depending on the developmental stage of sarcoma. In established tumors, IGF signaling is active, and NG2 inhibition targets cell proliferation and apoptosis.",29196603,2018,Effects of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (NG2/CSPG4) on soft-tissue sarcoma growth depend on tumor developmental stage.

1121,"Food insecurity remains a persistent problem in the United States. Several studies have shown that food insecurity is associated with child externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. However, some potential methodological limitations remain. For example, most studies use a household measure of food insecurity while there is evidence that children, especially younger ones, tend to be shielded by their parents from experiencing food insecurity. In addition, the mechanisms through which food insecurity affects children are not well understood. This study uses longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to address these limitations. Fixed-effects models show that the association is even larger using a measure of child food insecurity instead of a household one. Correlated-random effects models show a large difference in child behavior problems between food secure and food insecure children due to unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, the association between child food insecurity and child externalizing behaviors remains largely unexplained while food insecurity among adults explains almost all the variation in the association with child internalizing behaviors. Food insecure children and parents are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies, which may lead to behavior problems in young children. These findings underscore the need for greater focus on reducing the risk of food insecurity, especially for children in fragile families, in order to reduce behavior problems and improve their educational attainment.",29197238,2018,Food insecurity and child behavior problems in fragile families.

1123,"BACKGROUND & AIMS
Tricyclic antidepressants are effective in reducing symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD). We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a previous randomized clinical trial to determine whether the benefits of an antidepressant on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with FD were mediated by improving sleep or reducing anxiety. We explored the relationships between psychological measures, quality of sleep, and relief of symptoms.


METHODS
We analyzed data from a multicenter, double-blind trial that evaluated the efficacy of antidepressants on symptoms of FD, from October 2006 through October 2012. Patients (n = 292) were randomly assigned to groups given 50 mg amitriptyline, 10 mg escitalopram, or placebo for 12 weeks. During the study, participants completed the following validated psychological questionnaires: Symptom Check List 90, Symptom Somatic Checklist, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline and 12 weeks following treatment.


RESULTS
Baseline scores for the psychological and sleep measures were similar among groups; after 12 weeks there were no significant differences in scores among groups. Baseline mean global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores indicated poor sleep quality in all groups at baseline and after 12 weeks. Overall, antidepressants affected sleep duration scores: patients given amitriptyline had lower (better) scores than patients given placebo or escitalopram (P = .019). In all groups, responders had decreased anxiety and improvements in some sleep components.


CONCLUSIONS
In a post hoc analysis of data from a clinical trial that evaluated the effects of antidepressants in patients with FD, amitriptyline was found to reduce symptoms of FD, but its mechanism is unlikely to involve reductions in psychological distress.

In this study, we found that male mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus) directed more sniffing toward their own pups than toward alien pups. The numbers of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the medial preoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex were significantly increased when fathers were exposed to an alien pups; however, more brain regions such as paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, lateral habenula, ventral lateral septal nucleus, and medial amygdaloid nucleus showed increased number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons activated when the fathers were exposed to their own pups. Exposure to their own pups also induced a greater number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, lateral habenula, ventral lateral septal nucleus and medial amygdaloid nucleus, as well as higher expression of oxytocin and vasopressin in the paraventricular nucleus, compared with exposure to alien pups.

The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain healthcare costs empower the necessity to identify new models of care. Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. The objective was to test the feasibility and the efficacy in the improvement of the glycemic control of the teleconsultation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.


METHODS
A randomized open-label, parallel arms, controlled trial was conducted in two diabetes centers in Italy. Participants affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus have been randomly (1:1) assigned to receive their visits as standard or a web-based care. Patients in the teleconsultation group can arrange their appointments on a Web site and can also have access to web educational courses or to nutritional and psychological counseling. The primary outcome was the assessment of glycemic control by HbA1c measurement after a 12-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Overall 74 participants were followed for 1 year. HbA1c changes were not statistically different within (p = 0.56 for standard care group; p = 0.45 for telemedicine group) and between (p = 0.60) groups when considering differences from baseline to the end of the study. Patients randomized to teleconsultation reported reduced severe hypoglycemic episodes (p = 0.03). In addition, they were largely satisfied with the activities, perceived a good improvement in the self-management of the diabetes, and reported to have a time saving and a cost reduction.

1126,"INTRODUCTION
Smoking is a serious public health issue, being a precursor of heart disease and a predictor of sudden death due to myocardial ischemia. Major events in the patient's health can lead to radical changes in habits and the choice for different myocardial revascularization methods might differently impact smoking cessation and relapse.


OBJECTIVE
To study the rate and perpetuation of smoking cessation after myocardial revascularization comparing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).


METHODS
Smokers submitted to myocardial revascularization were divided into CABG and PCI groups. The research was conducted through interviews at the Hospital Santa Lucinda outpatient clinic. Patients with smoking cessation longer than 90 days before hospital admission, combined procedures, hospital readmission before 360 days after discharge, cases of death at any time, and emergency procedures were excluded from the study. The start of the smoking cessation period was determined as just after hospital discharge, with a follow-up of 12 months.


RESULTS
The proportion of patients reporting smoking relapse was significantly lower in the CABG than in the PCI group at 30 (11.1% vs. 20.8%; P=0.039) and at 180 days (23.1% vs. 41.5%; P=0.002), but no differences were observed between the two groups at 360 days after hospital discharge (51.9% vs. 54.1%; P=0.719). High levels of nicotine dependence and passive smoking showed to be important predictors of smoking relapse in the long-term.


CONCLUSION
The occurrence of a major surgical procedure seems to have beneficial psychological effects, representing an interesting setting for smoking cessation counseling to have higher chances of success.",29211218,2017,Impact of Myocardial Revascularization Method on Smoking Cessation: Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting versus Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
1127,"Stress refers to a dynamic process in which the homeostasis of an organism is challenged, the outcome depending on the type, severity, and duration of stressors involved, the stress responses triggered, and the stress resilience of the organism. Importantly, the relationship between stress and the immune system is bidirectional, as not only stressors have an impact on immune function, but alterations in immune function themselves can elicit stress responses. Such bidirectional interactions have been prominently identified to occur in the gastrointestinal tract in which there is a close cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the local immune system, governed by the permeability of the intestinal mucosa. External stressors disturb the homeostasis between microbiota and gut, these disturbances being signaled to the brain via multiple communication pathways constituting the gut-brain axis, ultimately eliciting stress responses and perturbations of brain function. In view of these relationships, the present article sets out to highlight some of the interactions between peripheral immune activation, especially in the visceral system, and brain function, behavior, and stress coping. These issues are exemplified by the way through which the intestinal microbiota as well as microbe-associated molecular patterns including lipopolysaccharide communicate with the immune system and brain, and the mechanisms whereby overt inflammation in the GI tract impacts on emotional-affective behavior, pain sensitivity, and stress coping. The interactions between the peripheral immune system and the brain take place along the gut-brain axis, the major communication pathways of which comprise microbial metabolites, gut hormones, immune mediators, and sensory neurons. Through these signaling systems, several transmitter and neuropeptide systems within the brain are altered under conditions of peripheral immune stress, enabling adaptive processes related to stress coping and resilience to take place. These aspects of the impact of immune stress on molecular and behavioral processes in the brain have a bearing on several disturbances of mental health and highlight novel opportunities of therapeutic intervention.",29213271,2017,Visceral Inflammation and Immune Activation Stress the Brain.
1128,"BACKGROUND
Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is a prevalent complication secondary to cancer treatments which significantly impacts the physical and psychological health of breast cancer survivors. Previous research shows increasing use of low level laser therapy (LLLT), now commonly referred to as photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, for BCRL. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of LLLT (PBM) in the management of BCRL.


METHODS
Clinical trials were searched in PubMed, AMED, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure up to November 2016. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and adequacy of LLLT (PBM) in these clinical trials. Primary outcome measures were limb circumference/volume, and secondary outcomes included pain intensity and range of motion. Because data were clinically heterogeneous, best evidence synthesis was performed.


RESULTS
Eleven clinical trials were identified, of which seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were chosen for analysis. Overall, the methodological quality of included RCTs was high, whereas the reporting of treatment parameters was poor. Results indicated that there is strong evidence (three high quality trials) showing LLLT (PBM) was more effective than sham treatment for limb circumference/volume reduction at a short-term follow-up. There is moderate evidence (one high quality trial) indicating that LLLT (PBM) was more effective than sham laser for short-term pain relief, and limited evidence (one low quality trial) that LLLT (PBM) was more effective than no treatment for decreasing limb swelling at short-term follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Based upon the current systematic review, LLLT (PBM) may be considered an effective treatment approach for women with BCRL. Due to the limited numbers of published trials available, there is a clear need for well-designed high-quality trials in this area.

The C-DEBQ encompassing three subscales that including emotional eating, external eating, and restrained eating. Each subscale's reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to validate the model fit. A total of 340 normal weight and overweight parents of school-age children from various geographical locations in Taiwan participated in the study. Each subscale, emotional, external, and restrained eating, displayed good-to-excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas: .94, .81, and .89, respectively). CFA showed that the three-factor solution had close goodness-of-fit to the data for supporting the factorial validity (x2=1239.03, df=488, p<.001, x2/df=2.54, root mean square error of approximation=.067, comparative fit index=.879, Tucker-Lewis index=.869). Findings suggest that the C-DEBQ is a psychometrically reliable and valid instrument with the potential to assess overeating styles in Taiwanese parents of school-age children.

1130,"Repeated exposure to cocaine produces structural and functional modifications at synapses from neurons in several brain regions including the nucleus accumbens. These changes are thought to underlie cocaine-induced sensitization. The ubiquitin proteasome system plays a crucial role in the remodeling of synapses and has recently been implicated in addiction-related behavior. The ATPase Rpt6 subunit of the 26S proteasome is phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II alpha at ser120 which is thought to regulate proteasome activity and distribution in neurons. Here, we demonstrate that Rpt6 phosphorylation is involved in cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Cocaine concomitantly increases proteasome activity and Rpt6 S120 phosphorylation in cultured neurons and in various brain regions of wild type mice including the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. In contrast, cocaine does not increase proteasome activity in Rpt6 phospho-mimetic (ser120Asp) mice. Strikingly, we found a complete absence of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization in the Rpt6 ser120Asp mice. Together, these findings suggest a critical role for Rpt6 phosphorylation and proteasome function in the regulation cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity.",29217409,2017,Proteasome phosphorylation regulates cocaine-induced sensitization.
1131,"Ohtahara syndrome, also known as type 4 of Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with suppression bursts (EIEE-4) is currently an untreatable disorder that presents with seizures and impaired cognition. EIEE-4 patients have mutations most frequently in the STXBP1 gene encoding a Sec protein, munc18-1. The exact molecular mechanism of how these munc18-1 mutations cause impaired cognition, remains elusive. The leading haploinsufficiency hypothesis posits that mutations in munc18-1 render the protein unstable leading to its degradation. Expression driven by the healthy allele is not sufficient to maintain the physiological function resulting in haploinsufficiency. The aim of this study has been to understand how munc18-1 haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4. Here we present results from behavioral to cellular effects from a mouse model of munc18-1 haploinsufficiency. Munc18-1 heterozygous knock-out mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory in behavior tests as well as reduced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation. Cultured munc18-1 heterozygous hippocampal neurons had significantly slower rate of synaptic vesicle release and decreased readily releasable vesicle pool compared to wild-type control neurons in fluorescent FM dye assays. These results demonstrate that reduced munc18-1 levels are sufficient to impair learning and memory by reducing neurotransmitter release. Therefore, our study implicates munc18-1 haploinsufficiency as a primary cause of cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4 patients.",29217410,2017,Munc18-1 haploinsufficiency impairs learning and memory by reduced synaptic vesicular release in a model of Ohtahara syndrome.
1132,"Altricial young are dependent on adults for protection and food, and they display nutritional need by begging to elicit feeding from parents. Begging at high levels can be energetically expensive and attract predators; thus, an individual must balance its nutritional needs with these potential costs. Further, because a parent is limited in the amount of food it can provide, begging can contribute to both parent-offspring conflict and sibling-sibling competition. Many extrinsic and intrinsic factors may contribute to begging behavior. One intrinsic factor of interest is corticosterone (CORT), a metabolic hormone hypothesized to play a role in regulating a nestling's begging behavior. We investigated the hypothesis that increased exposure to CORT influences nestling begging behavior in an altricial species, the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). We treated one nestling per treatment nest with a twice-daily dose of exogenous hormone via a CORT-injected waxworm, whereas a second individual received a vehicle-injected waxworm. We monitored individual nestling and adult behavior at all nests with the use of high-definition video cameras on several days during treatment. We found no difference in begging rate between CORT fed and vehicle fed nestlings within a treatment nest. Further, to determine whether CORT treatment had indirect effects on the entire brood, we monitored additional nests, in which nestlings were not manipulated. When treatment and controls were compared, overall begging rates of nestlings in treatment nests were greater than those in control nests. This result suggests that CORT treatment of an individual altered its behavior, as well as that of its siblings.",29217466,2018,Influence of corticosterone treatment on nestling begging in Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens).
1133,"Slo2 channels are large-conductance potassium channels abundantly expressed in the nervous system. However, it is unclear how their expression level in neurons is regulated. Here we report that HRPU-2, an RNA-binding protein homologous to mammalian heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), plays an important role in regulating the expression of SLO-2 (a homolog of mammalian Slo2) in Caenorhabditis elegans Loss-of-function (lf) mutants of hrpu-2 were isolated in a genetic screen for suppressors of a sluggish phenotype caused by a hyperactive SLO-2. In hrpu-2(lf) mutants, SLO-2-mediated delayed outward currents in neurons are greatly decreased, and neuromuscular synaptic transmission is enhanced. These mutant phenotypes can be rescued by expressing wild-type HRPU-2 in neurons. HRPU-2 binds to slo-2 mRNA, and hrpu-2(lf) mutants show decreased SLO-2 protein expression. In contrast, hrpu-2(lf) does not alter the expression of either the BK channel SLO-1 or the Shaker type potassium channel SHK-1. hrpu-2(lf) mutants are indistinguishable from wild type in gross motor neuron morphology and locomotion behavior. Together, these observations suggest that HRPU-2 plays important roles in SLO-2 function by regulating SLO-2 protein expression, and that SLO-2 is likely among a restricted set of proteins regulated by HRPU-2. Mutations of human Slo2 channel and hnRNP U are strongly linked to epileptic disorders and intellectual disability. The findings of this study suggest a potential link between these two molecules in human patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U) belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that play important roles in controlling gene expression. Recent studies have established a strong link between mutations of hnRNP U and human epilepsies and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear how mutations of hnRNP U may cause such disorders. This study shows that mutations of HRPU-2, a worm homolog of mammalian hnRNP U, result in dysfunction of a Slo2 potassium channel, which is critical to neuronal function.

1134,"CONTEXT
The provision of palliative care varies appropriately by clinical factors such as patient age and severity of disease and also varies by provider practice and specialty. Surgical patients are persistently less likely to receive palliative care than their medical counterparts for reasons that are not clear.


OBJECTIVES
We sought to characterize surgeon-specific determinants of palliative care in seriously ill and dying patients.


METHODS
We performed a systematic review of the literature focused on surgery and palliative care within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, and Ovid Medline databases from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2016 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative studies with primary data evaluating surgeons' attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors or experiences in care for seriously ill and dying patients were selected for full review by at least two study team members based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted based on a predetermined instrument and compared across studies using thematic analysis in a meta-synthesis of qualitative and quantitative findings.


RESULTS
A total of 2589 abstracts were identified and screened, and 35 articles (26 quantitative and nine qualitative) fulfilled criteria for full review. Among these, 17 articles explored practice and attitudes of surgeons regarding palliative and end-of-life care, 11 articles assessed training in palliative care, five characterized surgical decision making, one described behaviors of surgeons caring for seriously ill and dying patients, and one explicitly identified barriers to use of palliative care. Four major themes across studies affected receipt of palliative care for surgical patients: 1) surgeons' experience and knowledge, 2) surgeons' attitudes, 3) surgeons' preferences and decision making for treatment, and 4) perceived barriers.


CONCLUSIONS
Among the articles reviewed, surgeons overall demonstrated insight into the benefits of palliative care but reported limited knowledge and comfort as well as a multitude of challenges to introducing palliative care to their patients. These findings indicate a need for wider implementation of strategies that allow optimal integration of palliative care with surgical decision making.",29221845,2017,Characterizing the Role of U.S. Surgeons in the Provision of Palliative Care: A Systematic Review and Mixed-Methods Meta-Synthesis.

It has been shown that MicNo-ZnO particles exhibit both micron and nanosized particle characteristics. Although physical and chemical properties of MicNo-ZnO particles have been studied, their biocompatibility has not yet been evaluated. Accordingly, the research objective of this study was to evaluate in vitro cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and phototoxicity behaviors of designed MicNo-ZnO particles over human epidermal keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. MicNo-ZnO particles exhibit much less cytotoxicity with IC50 concentrations between 40 and 50μg/ml, genotoxicity above 40μg/ml and lower photo genotoxicity under UVA on HaCaT than the ZnO nanoparticles. Although their chemistries are the same, the source of this difference in toxicity values may be attributed to size differences between the particles that are probably due to their ability to penetrate into the cells. In the present study, the expansive and detailed in vitro toxicity tests show that the biocompatibility of MicNo-ZnO particles is much better than that of the ZnO nanoparticles. Consequently, MicNo-ZnO particles can be considered an important active ingredient alternative for sunscreen applications due to their safer characteristics with respect to ZnO nanoparticles.",29223573,2018,"Biocompatibility of designed MicNo-ZnO particles: Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and phototoxicity in human skin keratinocyte cells."
1136,"Songbirds are a well-established animal model to study the neural basis of learning, perception and production of complex vocalizations. In this system, telencephalic neurons in HVC present a state-dependent, highly selective response to auditory presentations of the bird's own song (BOS). This property provides an opportunity to study the neural code behind a complex motor behavior. In this work, we explore whether changes in the temporal structure of the sound envelope can drive changes in the neural responses of highly selective HVC units. We generated an envelope-modified BOS (MOD) by reversing each syllable's envelope but leaving the overall temporal structure of syllable spectra unchanged, which resulted in a subtle modification for each song syllable. We conducted in vivo electrophysiological recordings of HVC neurons in anaesthetized zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Units analyzed presented a high BOS selectivity and lower response to MOD, but preserved the profile response shape. These results show that the temporal evolution of the sound envelope is being sensed by the avian song system and suggest that the biomechanical properties of the vocal apparatus could play a role in enhancing subtle sound differences.",29234861,2018,Neural coding of sound envelope structure in songbirds.

He underwent a complete video polysomnography (VPSG), which showed a polygraphic pattern arising from stage N3 sleep related to the presence of simple motor behaviors. Routine blood tests showed a mild hyperthyroidism. After 4 months of thyrostatic treatment, the patient reported no more sleepwalking events. A VPSG performed at the last follow-up showed the absence of pathological electroclinical events arising from stage N3 sleep. Therefore, we hypothesize that there is a link between sleepwalking and thyroid dysfunction in our patient.",29246269,2018,Adult-Onset Sleepwalking Secondary to Hyperthyroidism: Polygraphic Evidence.
1139,"Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1ΔE9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.",29246925,2018,Aβ mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
1140,"Chendytes lawi, an extinct flightless diving anseriform from coastal California, was traditionally classified as a sea duck, tribe Mergini, based on similarities in osteological characters. We recover and analyze mitochondrial genomes of C. lawi and five additional Mergini species, including the extinct Labrador Duck, Camptorhynchus labradorius. Despite its diving morphology, C. lawi is reconstructed as an ancient relictual lineage basal to the dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini), revealing an additional example of convergent evolution of characters related to feeding behavior among ducks. The Labrador Duck is sister to Steller's Eider which may provide insights into the evolution and ecology of this poorly known extinct species. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of full length mitogenomes, from taxonomically distributed ancient and modern sources can improve phylogeny reconstruction of groups previously assessed with shorter single-gene mitochondrial sequences.",29247849,2017,Mitogenomics supports an unexpected taxonomic relationship for the extinct diving duck Chendytes lawi and definitively places the extinct Labrador Duck.
1141,"Past studies have identified hepatic tumors with mixed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) characteristics that have a more aggressive behavior and a poorer prognosis than classic HCC. Whether this pathologic heterogeneity is due to a cell of origin of bipotent liver progenitors or the plasticity of cellular constituents comprising these tumors remains debated. In this study, we investigated the potential acquisition of CC-like traits during advanced development of HCC in mice. Primary and rare high-grade HCC developed in a genetic mouse model. A mouse model of highly efficient HCC invasion and metastasis by orthotopic transplantation of liver cancer organoids propagated from primary tumors in the genetic model was further developed. Invasive/metastatic tumors developed in both models closely recapitulated advanced human HCC and displayed a striking acquisition of CC-related pathologic and molecular features, which was absent in the primary HCC tumors. Our study directly demonstrates the pathologic evolution of HCC during advanced tumor development, providing the first evidence that tumors with mixed HCC and CC features, or at least a subset of these tumors, represent a more advanced developmental stage of HCC. Finally, liver cancer organoid-generated high-grade tumors exhibited significantly increased extracellular vesicle secretion, suggesting that identifying tumor-specific extracellular vesicle proteins in plasma may be a promising tool for liver cancer detection.",29248454,2017,Acquisition of Cholangiocarcinoma Traits during Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Development in Mice.
1142,"Both social perception and temperament in young infants have been related to social functioning later in life. Previous functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2009) showed larger blood-oxygenation changes for social compared to non-social stimuli in the posterior temporal cortex of five-month-old infants. We sought to replicate and extend these findings by using fNIRS to study the neural basis of social perception in relation to infant temperament (Negative Affect) in 37 five-to-eight-month-old infants. Infants watched short videos displaying either hand and facial movements of female actors (social dynamic condition) or moving toys and machinery (non-social dynamic condition), while fNIRS data were collected over temporal brain regions. Negative Affect was measured using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Results showed significantly larger blood-oxygenation changes in the right posterior-temporal region in the social compared to the non-social condition. Furthermore, this differential activation was smaller in infants showing higher Negative Affect. Our results replicate those of Lloyd-Fox et al. and confirmed that five-to-eight-month-old infants show cortical specialization for social perception. Furthermore, the decreased cortical sensitivity to social stimuli in infants showing high Negative Affect may be an early biomarker for later difficulties in social interaction.",29248823,2017,Negative affect is related to reduced differential neural responses to social and non-social stimuli in 5-to-8-month-old infants: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy-study.
1143,"Alcohol problems have variable outcomes for marital relationships depending on whether drinking patterns are concordant or discordant among the members of the dyad; however, it is unclear what impact these variations in drinking patterns have on children. The current study was designed to explore several gaps and limitations in the parent heavy drinking literature. In particular, the prospective associations over 3years between parent heavy drinking, parenting, and child externalizing behavior were investigated in an integrated model to examine the influence of concordant and discordant drinking within couples on subsequent outcomes for their children. The study consisted of 180 couples recruited by mailings with children primarily between the ages of 4 and 11years old (52% male children). Parent-report of marital conflict, parenting, alcohol use, and child externalizing behavior were measured in a longitudinal study. Actor-Partner Interdependence Model analyses were conducted. Higher levels of maladaptive parenting were associated with higher externalizing for children of concordant drinking couples as opposed to discordant drinking couples. Implications for research and practice are discussed, including investigating mediators and moderators of the current findings such as quality of the parent-child relationship.",29253661,2018,Parents' concordant and discordant alcohol use and subsequent child behavioral outcomes.
1144,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common adverse effect experienced by cancer patients receiving treatment with paclitaxel. The voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Nav1.7) plays an important role in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain and in inherited human pain phenotypes, and its gene expression is increased in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of paclitaxel-treated rats. Hence, the potential of change in the expression and function of Nav1.7 protein in DRGs from male rats with paclitaxel-related CIPN and from male and female humans with cancer-related neuropathic pain was tested here. Double immunofluorescence in CIPN rats showed that Nav1.7 was upregulated in small DRG neuron somata, especially those also expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and in central processes of these cells in the superficial spinal dorsal horn. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat DRG neurons revealed that paclitaxel induced an enhancement of ProTx II (a selective Nav1.7 channel blocker)-sensitive sodium currents. Bath-applied ProTx II suppressed spontaneous action potentials in DRG neurons occurring in rats with CIPN, while intrathecal injection of ProTx II significantly attenuated behavioral signs of CIPN. Complementarily, DRG neurons isolated from segments where patients had a history of neuropathic pain also showed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence results indicating an increased expression of Nav1.7 associated with spontaneous activity. Nav1.7 was also colocalized in human cells expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and CGRP. Furthermore, ProTx II decreased firing frequency in human DRGs with spontaneous action potentials. This study suggests that Nav1.7 may provide a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced neuropathic pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This work demonstrates that the expression and function of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 are increased in a preclinical model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), the most common treatment-limiting side effect of all the most common anticancer therapies. This is key as gain-of-function mutations in human Nav1.7 recapitulate both the distribution and pain percept as shown by CIPN patients. This work also shows that Nav1.7 is increased in human DRG neurons only in dermatomes where patients are experiencing acquired neuropathic pain symptoms. This work therefore has major translational impact, indicating an important novel therapeutic avenue for neuropathic pain as a class.",29255002,2018,DRG Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel 1.7 Is Upregulated in Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy in Rats and in Humans with Neuropathic Pain.
1145,"The intercalated cells (ITCs) of the amygdala have been shown to be critical regulatory components of amygdalar circuits, which control appropriate fear responses. Despite this, the molecular processes guiding ITC development remain poorly understood. Here we establish the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 as a marker of ITCs during their migration from the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence through maturity. Using germline and conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse models, we show that Tshz1 is required for the proper migration and differentiation of ITCs. In the absence of Tshz1, migrating ITC precursors fail to settle in their stereotypical locations encapsulating the lateral amygdala and BLA. Furthermore, they display reductions in the ITC marker Foxp2 and ectopic persistence of the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence marker Sp8. Tshz1 mutant ITCs show increased cell death at postnatal time points, leading to a dramatic reduction by 3 weeks of age. In line with this, Foxp2-null mutants also show a loss of ITCs at postnatal time points, suggesting that Foxp2 may function downstream of Tshz1 in the maintenance of ITCs. Behavioral analysis of male Tshz1 cKOs revealed defects in fear extinction as well as an increase in floating during the forced swim test, indicative of a depression-like phenotype. Moreover, Tshz1 cKOs display significantly impaired social interaction (i.e., increased passivity) regardless of partner genetics. Together, these results suggest that Tshz1 plays a critical role in the development of ITCs and that fear, depression-like and social behavioral deficits arise in their absence.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We show here that the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 is expressed during development of the intercalated cells (ITCs) within the mouse amygdala. These neurons have previously been shown to play a crucial role in fear extinction. Tshz1 mouse mutants exhibit severely reduced numbers of ITCs as a result of abnormal migration, differentiation, and survival of these neurons. Furthermore, the loss of ITCs in mouse Tshz1 mutants correlates well with defects in fear extinction as well as the appearance of depression-like and abnormal social interaction behaviors reminiscent of depressive disorders observed in human patients with distal 18q deletions, including the Tshz1 locus.",29255003,2018,"Loss of Intercalated Cells (ITCs) in the Mouse Amygdala of Tshz1 Mutants Correlates with Fear, Depression, and Social Interaction Phenotypes."
1146,"Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons and their targets are involved in addiction and cue-induced relapse. However, afferents onto SNc dopamine neurons themselves appear insensitive to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, when afferents are collectively stimulated electrically. This contrasts with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, whose glutamate afferents react robustly to cocaine. We used an optogenetic strategy to isolate identified SNc inputs and determine whether cocaine sensitivity in the mouse SNc circuit is conferred at the level of three glutamate afferents: dorsal raphé nucleus (DR), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We found that excitatory afferents to SNc dopamine neurons are sensitive to cocaine in an afferent-specific manner. A single exposure to cocaine in vivo led to PPN-innervated synapses reducing the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor-mediated current ratio. In contrast to work in the VTA, this was due to increased NMDA receptor function with no change in AMPA receptor function. STN synapses showed a decrease in calcium-permeable AMPA receptors after cocaine, but no change in the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio. Cocaine also increased the release probability at DR-innervated and STN-innervated synapses, quantified by decreases in paired-pulse ratios. However, release probability at PPN-innervated synapses remained unaffected. By examining identified inputs, our results demonstrate a functional distribution among excitatory SNc afferent nuclei in response to cocaine, and suggest a compelling architecture for differentiation and separate parsing of inputs within the nigrostriatal system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Prior studies have established that substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are a key node in the circuitry that drives addiction and relapse, yet cocaine apparently has no effect on electrically stimulated excitatory inputs. Our study is the first to demonstrate the functional impact of a drug of abuse on synaptic mechanisms of identified afferents to the SNc. Optogenetic dissection of inputs originating from dorsal raphé, pedunculopontine, and subthalamic nuclei were tested for synaptic modifications following in vivo cocaine exposure. Our results demonstrate that cocaine differentially induces modifications to SNc synapses depending on input origin. This presents implications for understanding dopamine processing of motivated behavior; most critically, it indicates that dopamine neurons selectively modulate signal reception processed by afferent nuclei.",29263240,2018,Cocaine Selectively Reorganizes Excitatory Inputs to Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta Dopamine Neurons.
1147,"Altering the expression of Tomosyn-1 (Tomo-1), a soluble, R-SNARE domain-containing protein, significantly affects behavior in mice, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans Yet, the mechanisms that modulate Tomo-1 expression and its regulatory activity remain poorly defined. Here, we found that Tomo-1 expression levels influence postsynaptic spine density. Tomo-1 overexpression increased dendritic spine density, whereas Tomo-1 knockdown (KD) decreased spine density. These findings identified a novel action of Tomo-1 on dendritic spines, which is unique because it occurs independently of Tomo-1's C-terminal R-SNARE domain. We also demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is known to influence synaptic strength, dynamically regulates Tomo-1 protein levels. Immunoprecipitated and affinity-purified Tomo-1 from cultured rat hippocampal neurons was ubiquitinated, and the levels of ubiquitinated Tomo-1 dramatically increased upon pharmacological proteasome blockade. Moreover, Tomo-1 ubiquitination appeared to be mediated through an interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, as immunoprecipitation of Tomo-1 from neurons co-precipitated HRD1, and this interaction increases upon proteasome inhibition. Further, in vitro reactions indicated direct, HRD1 concentration-dependent Tomo-1 ubiquitination. We also noted that the UPS regulates both Tomo-1 expression and functional output, as HRD1 KD in hippocampal neurons increased Tomo-1 protein level and dendritic spine density. Notably, the effect of HRD1 KD on spine density was mitigated by additional KD of Tomo-1, indicating a direct HRD1/Tomo-1 effector relationship. In summary, our results indicate that the UPS is likely to participate in tuning synaptic efficacy and spine dynamics by precise regulation of neuronal Tomo-1 levels.",29269412,2018,The ubiquitin-proteasome system functionally links neuronal Tomosyn-1 to dendritic morphology.

Along with the technological progress in the neurosciences, different methods of stress induction have been developed for the special requirements regarding the acquisition of neuroimaging data. However, these paradigms often differ from ecologically valid stress inductions such as the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in substantial ways. In the study at hand, we used the rather robust optical imaging method of functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess brain activation during the TSST and two non-stressful control conditions. Additionally, we measured other stress parameters including the cortisol response and subjective stress ratings. As expected we found significant increases in subjective and physiological stress measures during the TSST in comparison to the baseline and control conditions. We found higher activation in parts of the cognitive control network (CCN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) - comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus and superior parietal cortex - during the performance of the TSST in comparison to the control conditions. Further, calculation errors during the TSST as well as subjective and physiological stress parameters correlated significantly with the activation in the CCN. Our study confirms the validity of previous neuroimaging data obtained from adapted stress procedures by providing cortical activation data during a classical stress induction paradigm (i.e., the TSST) for the first time.",29274500,2017,Cortical hemodynamic changes during the Trier Social Stress Test: An fNIRS study.
1149,"The neural circuitry mediating the influence of motivation on long-term declarative or episodic memory formation is delineated in young adults, but its status is unknown in healthy aging. We examined the effect of reward and punishment anticipation on intentional declarative memory formation for words using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) monetary incentive encoding task in twenty-one younger and nineteen older adults. At 24-hour memory retrieval testing, younger adults were significantly more likely to remember words associated with motivational cues than neutral cues. Motivational enhancement of memory in younger adults occurred only for recollection (""remember"" responses) and not for familiarity (""familiar"" responses). Older adults had overall diminished memory and did not show memory gains in association with motivational cues. Memory encoding associated with monetary rewards or punishments activated motivational (substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area) and memory-related (hippocampus) brain regions in younger, but not older, adults during the target word periods. In contrast, older and younger adults showed similar activation of these brain regions during the anticipatory motivational cue interval. In a separate monetary incentive delay task that did not require learning, we found evidence for relatively preserved striatal reward anticipation in older adults. This supports a potential dissociation between incidental and intentional motivational processes in healthy aging. The finding that motivation to obtain rewards and avoid punishments had reduced behavioral and neural influence on intentional episodic memory formation in older compared to younger adults is relevant to life-span theories of cognitive aging including the dopaminergic vulnerability hypothesis.",29274503,2017,Human aging reduces the neurobehavioral influence of motivation on episodic memory.

Signal transduction from one neuron to another occurs at synapses, and relies on both electrical and chemical signal propagation. At chemical synapses, incoming electrical action potentials trigger the release of chemical neurotransmitters that are sensed by the connected cell and here reconverted to an electrical signal. The presynaptic conversion of an electrical to a chemical signal is an energy demanding, highly regulated process that relies on a complex, evolutionarily conserved molecular machinery.

Children who live in economically stressed urban environments are at particular risk for sleep deficiency and its negative consequences. Although efficacious sleep health interventions are available, few address the context of economically stressed urban environments. The purpose of this paper is to describe a two-phase protocol for an ongoing NIH/NINR-funded community-engaged study designed to understand the perspectives of parents, community child care and pediatric health care providers about sleep habits, factors that contribute to sleep and sleep habits, sleep difficulty, and potentially useful sleep promotion strategies among children living in economically stressed urban environments. The social-ecological model guides this study. Phase I employs a convergent mixed-methods design, in which we are conducting semi-structured interviews with parents, childcare providers, and primary health care providers. We are collecting 9 days of objective sleep data (wrist actigraphy) from children who are 6-18 months (n = 15) and 19-36 months of age (n = 15) and parent reports of sleep and sleep-related factors using standard questionnaires. In Phase I, we will use a qualitative descriptive approach to analyze the interview data, and descriptive statistics to analyze the survey and actigraph data. In Phase II, we will use the information to develop a contextually relevant program to promote sleep health.

1153,"BACKGROUND
Self-report measures are used to evaluate surgery outcome but are not necessarily indicative of actual disabilities.


RESEARCH QUESTION
The aim of the present study was to determine the association between self-report assessments of quality of life and objective measures of function in patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative disease. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of lumbar spinal fusion surgery on this relationship.


METHODS
Before and 6 month after surgery 26 patients completed self-report questionnaires and assessments of 3D gait analysis and trunk range of motion (ROM) during standing.


RESULTS
Before surgery, questionnaires were not correlated with any of the gait parameters and with only 2 trunk ROM parameters. Six month after surgery, the questionnaires showed 12 significant correlations with gait parameters and 19 with trunk ROM parameters. A better Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (r = 0.464, p = .026), EQ-5D (r = -0.440, p = .036), and EQ VAS (r = -0.472, p = .023) score were correlated with a reduced anterior thorax tilt during walking. Maximum forward flexion of the trunk during standing was correlated with a better EQ-5D (r = 0.684, p = .001) and ODI (r = -0.560, p = .008) score as well as with reduced pain scores.


SIGNIFICANCE
The lack of association between self-reported questionnaires and objective measures of function before surgery was likely due to psychological distress, correlating with emotional and cognitive function rather than true functional capacities. The influence of these psychological factors might be reduced after surgery due to a reduction of low back pain. To obtain an accurate assessment of impairment, there is a need to evaluate function by measuring objective physiologic parameters that are unsusceptible to voluntary or affective influences.",29287206,2017,Effect of lumbar spinal fusion surgery on the association of self-report measures with objective measures of physical function.
1154,"The timeless2 (tim2) gene is an insect orthologue of the mammalian clock gene Timeless (mTim). Although its functional role has been extensively studied in mammals, little is known regarding its role in insects. In the present study, we obtained tim2 cDNA (Gb'tim2) from the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus and characterized its functional role in embryonic development, egg production, and circadian rhythms. Gb'tim2 gave rise to a 1432 amino acid protein, and showed approximately 65% homology to that of Drosophila melanogaster. When treated with parental Gb'tim2RNAi, less than 2% of the treated eggs hatched. On the other hand, control eggs treated with DsRed2RNAi demonstrated a hatching rate of 70%. In most of the Gb'tim2RNAi treated embryos, development was arrested in early stages. Egg production in ovaries of adult virgin females treated with Gb'tim2RNAi was significantly reduced. In addition, while Gb'tim2RNAi crickets exhibited clear locomotor rhythm synchronized with light cycles, their light-on peak was weaker than that of control crickets. Under constant darkness, the activity rhythm of Gb'tim2RNAi crickets was often split into two components running with different periods. Molecular analysis revealed that Gb'tim2RNAi treatment downregulated mRNA levels of Gb'per and Gb'Clk, and enhanced Gb'cyc expression rhythm; no distinct effect was found on Gb'tim expression levels. The change in Gb'per, Gb'Clk and Gb'cyc levels may underlie the altered behavioral rhythms in Gb'tim2RNAi crickets. Both Gb'ClkRNAi and Gb'cycRNAi downregulated Gb'tim2 expression, which suggested that transcription of Gb'tim2 is mediated by Gb'CLK and Gb'CYC through E-box. These results suggested that Gb'tim2 may be involved in both reproduction and circadian rhythm regulation in crickets.",29287788,2018,timeless2 plays an important role in reproduction and circadian rhythms in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus.
1155,"Acute stress has a profound influence on learning, as has been demonstrated in verbal learning or fear conditioning. However, its effect on appetitive conditioning is still unclear. Fear conditioning research suggests the possibility of overgeneralization of conditioning to the CS- under acute stress due to its effect on prefrontal and hippocampal processing. In this study, participants (N = 56 males) were subjected to the Trier Social Stress Test or a placebo version. After that, all participants underwent an appetitive conditioning paradigm in the fMRI, in which one neutral cue (CS+) was repeatedly paired with reward, while another (CS-) was not. Importantly, the stress-group revealed overgeneralization of conditioning to the CS- on the behavioral level. On the neural level, stressed participants showed increased connectivity between the hippocampus and amygdala, vACC, and OFC, which maintain specificity of conditioning and also showed reduced differential activation. The results indicate overgeneralization of appetitive conditioning promoted by maladaptive balancing of pattern separation and pattern completion in the hippocampus under acute stress and are discussed with respect to clinical implications.",29288866,2017,Altered reward learning and hippocampal connectivity following psychosocial stress.
1156,"Magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI) and MR electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) are two emerging modalities, which combine weak time-varying currents injected via surface electrodes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire information about the current flow and ohmic conductivity distribution at high spatial resolution. The injected current flow creates a magnetic field in the head, and the component of the induced magnetic field ΔBz,c parallel to the main scanner field causes small shifts in the precession frequency of the magnetization. The measured MRI signal is modulated by these shifts, allowing to determine ΔBz,c for the reconstruction of the current flow and ohmic conductivity. Here, we demonstrate reliable ΔBz,c measurements in-vivo in the human brain based on multi-echo spin echo (MESE) and steady-state free precession free induction decay (SSFP-FID) sequences. In a series of experiments, we optimize their robustness for in-vivo measurements while maintaining a good sensitivity to the current-induced fields. We validate both methods by assessing the linearity of the measured ΔBz,c with respect to the current strength. For the more efficient SSFP-FID measurements, we demonstrate a strong influence of magnetic stray fields on the ΔBz,c images, caused by non-ideal paths of the electrode cables, and validate a correction method. Finally, we perform measurements with two different current injection profiles in five subjects. We demonstrate reliable recordings of ΔBz,c fields as weak as 1 nT, caused by currents of 1 mA strength. Comparison of the ΔBz,c measurements with simulated ΔBz,c images based on FEM calculations and individualized head models reveals significant linear correlations in all subjects, but only for the stray field-corrected data. As final step, we reconstruct current density distributions from the measured and simulated ΔBz,c data. Reconstructions from non-corrected ΔBz,c measurements systematically overestimate the current densities. Comparing the current densities reconstructed from corrected ΔBz,c measurements and from simulated ΔBz,c images reveals an average coefficient of determination R2 of 71%. In addition, it shows that the simulations underestimated the current strength on average by 24%. Our results open up the possibility of using MRI to systematically validate and optimize numerical field simulations that play an important role in several neuroscience applications, such as transcranial brain stimulation, and electro- and magnetoencephalography.",29288869,2017,Human in-vivo brain magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI).
1157,"This study is the first to fully evaluate whether electrical signals applied to large insects during electropenetrography (EPG; also called electrical penetration graph) negatively affect insect behavior. During EPG, electrical signals are applied to plants, and thus to the gold-wire-tethered insects feeding on them. The insect completes an electrical circuit whose changes in voltage reflect the insect's stylet probing/penetration behaviors, recorded as waveform output. For nearly 50 years of EPG science, evidence has supported that there are no or negligible effects on tiny insects from applied electricity during EPG. Recently however, EPG studies of large-bodied hemipterans such as heteropterans and sharpshooter leafhoppers have been published. The wider stylet diameters of such large insects cause them to have lower inherent resistances to applied signals compared with smaller insects, conveying more electrical current. The present study asked whether such increased currents would affect insect stylet probing, by comparing Lygus lineolaris behaviors on pin-head cotton squares using an AC-DC electropenetrograph. Effects of AC or DC applied signals were separately examined in two factorial studies, each comparing four input resistor (Ri) levels (106, 107, 108 and 109 Ω) and four applied voltage levels (2, 60, 150 and 250 mV). Results showed that changes in both probing and non-probing behaviors were indeed caused by changing signal type, Ri level, or applied voltage. Negative effects on feeding were numerically greater overall for DC than AC applied signals, perhaps due to muscular tetany from DC; however, AC versus DC could not be statistically tested. Results strongly support the need for flexible Ri and applied voltage levels and types, to tailor instrument settings to the size and special needs of each insect subject. Our findings will facilitate further EPG studies of Lygus spp., such as host plant resistance or insecticidal assays/bioassays to assess mode of action and appropriate dosage. It is hoped that this study will also inform EPG studies of similar, large heteropterans in the future.",29291390,2018,Certain applied electrical signals during EPG cause negative effects on stylet probing behaviors by adult Lygus lineolaris (Hemiptera: Miridae).
1158,"People engaged in interactive decision making rely on prior decision behaviors by other persons to make new choices and they exhibit inter-brain synchrony between each other. The functional meanings of such inter-brain synchrony, however, remains obscure. In the present study, dyads (15 pairs, all female) played the Prisoner's Dilemma game while their brain activities were recorded simultaneously by electroencephalography (EEG)-based hyperscanning technique. We manipulated the context of the game with higher versus lower cooperation index (HCI vs. LCI) and to each participant, we depicted the interaction as involving either another human partner or a machine (H-H vs. H-M). The results showed a higher cooperation rate and larger theta/alpha-band inter-brain synchrony in condition H-H than in H-M. In the condition H-H, there were larger centrofrontal theta-band and centroparietal alpha-band inter-brain synchrony in tasks set for high cooperation (HCI vs. LCI). Enhanced inter-brain synchrony covaried with increased cooperative choices observed between LCI and HCI. Furthermore, a subjective measure of perceived cooperativeness mediated the relationship between game context and inter-brain synchrony. These findings provide evidence for a role of cooperation on inter-brain synchrony during interactive decision making, and suggest distinct underlying neural processes recruited by cooperation contexts to enable high-level social cognitive processing in decision making.",29292232,2017,Inter-brain synchrony and cooperation context in interactive decision making.
1159,"Noise is a challenge for animals that use acoustic communication to find a mate. A potent source of noise in animal communication is that arising from other conspecific signals, whose co-occurrence can result in extensive interference-evident as the so called ""cocktail-party problem""-that may affect the receiver mechanisms to detect potential mates. We studied grasshopper females to explore how modifications of the song pattern influence song recognition. First, we degraded an attractive model song with random fluctuations of increasing amplitudes out of different frequency bands, and determined ""critical degradation levels"" at which the females ceased to respond. A masker band with frequencies between 0 and 200 Hz, which covers the frequency range of the natural song envelope, was by 3-5 dB more destructive in hampering signal recognition than frequencies above 200 Hz. As second approach, we applied temporal disturbances such as accentuations or gaps at different positions within the song subunits and observed how response behavior was affected. Accentuations at subunit start increased, whereas those in the midst or at the end of a subunit reduced attractiveness. Gaps at these positions had diverse effects. The results are discussed with respect to neuronal filtering.",29294159,2018,Robustness of an innate releasing mechanism against degradation of acoustic communication signals in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus.
1160,"In the absence of a task, the human brain enters a mode of slow spontaneous fluctuations. A fundamental, unresolved question is whether these fluctuations are ongoing and thus persist during task engagement, or alternatively, are quenched and replaced by task-related activations. Here, we examined this issue in the human visual cortex, using fMRI. Participants were asked to either perform a recognition task of randomly appearing face and non-face targets (attended condition) or watch them passively (unattended condition). Importantly, in approximately half of the trials, all sensory stimuli were absent. Our results show that even in the absence of stimuli, spontaneous fluctuations were suppressed by attention. The effect occurred in early visual cortex as well as in fronto-parietal attention network regions. During unattended trials, the activity fluctuations were negatively linked to pupil diameter, arguing against attentional fluctuations as underlying the effect. The results demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations do not remain unchanged with task performance, but are rather modulated according to behavioral and cognitive demands.",29294387,2017,Quenching of spontaneous fluctuations by attention in human visual cortex.
1161,"OBJECTIVE
The present study was designed to analyze the immunolocalization of proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, such as moesin and Rho-A, in benign odontogenic lesions that present with expansive growth and invasive clinical behavior.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expressions of moesin and Rho-A in odontogenic epithelium were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in 45 odontogenic lesions using monoclonal antibodies.


RESULTS
Our results demonstrated strong membranous and cytoplasmic expressions of moesin in the epithelial cells in 66.7% and 44.4% of the odontogenic lesions, respectively. Furthermore, Rho-A expression in odontogenic epithelium was strong in the membrane and cytoplasm of 51.1% and 62.2% of the odontogenic lesions, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found between the membranous and cytoplasmic expressions of moesin (p = 0.000) and those of Rho-A (p = 0.048) in odontogenic epithelial cells, while no statistically significant correlation was found between moesin and Rho-A expressions (p > 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The present study confirmed the strong expressions of moesin and Rho-A by odontogenic epithelial cells, suggesting their involvement in the development of benign odontogenic lesions. However, this study has failed to detect the connection between the moesin and Rho-A interaction in expansive growth and local invasiveness of these lesions.",29294450,2018,Immunoexpression of proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling in benign odontogenic lesions.
1162,"BACKGROUND
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are considered as the two most widespread obstructive lung diseases, whereas they affect more than 500 million people worldwide. Unfortunately, the requirement for detailed geometric models of the lungs in combination with the increased computational resources needed for the simulation of the breathing did not allow great progress to be made in the past for the better understanding of inflammatory diseases of the airways through detailed modelling approaches. In this context, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations accompanied by fluid particle tracing (FPT) analysis of the inhaled ambient particles are deemed critical for lung function assessment. Also they enable the understanding of particle depositions on the airways of patients, since these accumulations may affect or lead to inflammations. In this direction, the current study conducts an initial investigation for the better comprehension of particle deposition within the lungs. More specifically, accurate models of the airways obstructions that relate to pulmonary disease are developed and a thorough assessment of the airflow behavior together with identification of the effects of inhaled particle properties, such as size and density, is conducted. Our approach presents a first step towards an effective personalization of pulmonary treatment in regards to the geometric characteristics of the lungs and the in depth understanding of airflows within the airways.


METHODS
A geometry processing technique involving contraction algorithms is established and used to employ the different respiratory arrangements associated with lung related diseases that exhibit airways obstructions. Apart from the normal lung case, two categories of obstructed cases are examined, i.e. models with obstructions in both lungs and models with narrowings in the right lung only. Precise assumptions regarding airflow and deposition fraction (DF) over various sections of the lungs are drawn by simulating these distinct incidents through the finite volume method (FVM) and particularly the CFD and FPT algorithms. Moreover, a detailed parametric analysis clarifies the effects of the particles size and density in terms of regional deposition upon several parts of the pulmonary system. In this manner, the deposition pattern of various substances can be assessed.


RESULTS
For the specific case of the unobstructed lung model most particles are detected on the right lung (48.56% of total, when the air flowrate is 12.6 L/min), a fact that is also true when obstructions arise symmetrically in both lungs (51.45% of total, when the air flowrate is 6.06 L/min and obstructions occur after the second generation). In contrast, when narrowings are developed on the right lung only, most particles are pushed on the left section (68.22% of total, when the air flowrate is 11.2 L/min) indicating that inhaled medication is generally deposited away from the areas of inflammation. This observation is useful when designing medical treatment of lung diseases. Furthermore, particles with diameters from 1 μm to 10 μm are shown to be mainly deposited on the lower airways, whereas particles with diameters of 20 μm and 30 μm are mostly accumulated in the upper airways. As a result, the current analysis indicates increased DF levels in the upper airways when the particle diameter is enlarged. Additionally, when the particles density increases from 1000 Kg/m3 to 2000 Kg/m3, the DF is enhanced on every generation and for all cases investigated herein. The results obtained by our simulations provide an accurate and quantitative estimation of all important parameters involved in lung modeling.


CONCLUSIONS
The treatment of respiratory diseases with inhaled medical substances can be advanced by the clinical use of accurate CFD and FPT simulations and specifically by evaluating the deposition of inhaled particles in a regional oriented perspective in regards to different particle sizes and particle densities. Since a drug with specific characteristics (i.e. particle size and density) exhibits maximum deposition on particular lung areas, the current study provides initial indications to a qualified physician for proper selection of medication.",29297393,2017,Substance deposition assessment in obstructed pulmonary system through numerical characterization of airflow and inhaled particles attributes.

The multipatcher significantly extends automated patch clamping, or 'autopatching', to guide four interacting electrodes in a coordinated fashion, avoiding mechanical coupling in the brain. We demonstrate its performance in the cortex of anesthetized and awake mice.

1164,"BACKGROUND
Traditional survey methods are limited in the study of hidden populations due to the hard to access properties, including lack of a sampling frame, sensitivity issue, reporting error, small sample size, etc. The rapid increase of online communities, of which members interact with others via the Internet, have generated large amounts of data, offering new opportunities for understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample sizes and richness of information. In this study, we try to understand the multidimensional characteristics of a hidden population by analyzing the massive data generated in the online community.


METHODS
By elaborately designing crawlers, we retrieved a complete dataset from the ""HIV bar,"" the largest bar related to HIV on the Baidu Tieba platform, for all records from January 2005 to August 2016. Through natural language processing and social network analysis, we explored the psychology, behavior and demand of online HIV population and examined the network community structure.


RESULTS
In HIV communities, the average topic similarity among members is positively correlated to network efficiency (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), indicating that the closer the social distance between members of the community, the more similar their topics. The proportion of negative users in each community is around 60%, weakly correlated with community size (r = 0.25, p = 0.002). It is found that users suspecting initial HIV infection or first in contact with high-risk behaviors tend to seek help and advice on the social networking platform, rather than immediately going to a hospital for blood tests.

1165,"This brief commentary reviews key steps in the history of steroid endocrinology that have resulted in important conceptual shifts. Our understanding of the ""Fast Effects of Steroids"" now reflect substantial progress, including the major concept that steroids act rapidly on a variety of physiological and behavioral responses, via mechanisms that are too fast to be fully accounted for by classical receptor-dependent regulation of gene transcription. Several so-called 'non-classical' mechanisms have been identified and include binding to membrane receptors and regulating non genomic signaling cascades. We survey the discovery of steroids, the initial characterization of their intracellular receptors, key progress in the understanding of the genomic effects of steroids and then the progressive discovery of the rapid non-classical and membrane-initiated actions of steroids. Foundational discoveries about brain steroid synthesis in neural processes and terminals has converged with emerging evidence for the rapid actions of steroids on brain and behavior. Had the rapid effects of steroids in the central nervous system been discovered first, these molecules would likely now be considered as a class of neurotransmitter.",29305886,2018,"Steroids and the brain: 50years of research, conceptual shifts and the ascent of non-classical and membrane-initiated actions."

To investigate the effects of different decontamination treatments on microstructure of titanium (Ti) surface as well as proliferation and adhesion of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ti discs with machined (M) and sand blasted, acid etched (SAE) surfaces were treated with five different decontamination treatments: (1) stainless steel curette (SSC), ultrasonic system with (2) straight carbon fiber tip (UCF) or (3) metal tip (UM), (4) rotating Ti brush (RTB), and (5) Er:YAG laser (30 mJ/pulse at 30 Hz). Surface roughness was analyzed under optical interferometry. HGFs were cultured on each disc. Proliferation and adhesive strength were analyzed. qRT-PCR and ELISA were performed to detect the RNA and protein expression of FAK, ITGB1, COL1A1, and FN1 respectively from different Ti surfaces.


RESULTS
Surface roughness increased on M surface. Proliferation, adhesive strength and gene expression were higher on M surface than SAE surface. Decontamination treatments affected surface parameters significantly (P < 0.001), making M surface less smooth while SAE surface became less rough. SSC, UCF, UM and RTB decreased proliferation on M surfaces significantly (P < 0.05). UCF, RTB and laser increased proliferation on SAE surface significantly (P < 0.05). UM decreased adhesive strength on M surface significantly and laser increased adhesive strength on SAE surface significantly (P < 0.05). Gene expression increased with time and was altered by decontamination treatments significantly (P < 0.001).

1167,"Novel paradigms have allowed for more precise measurements of sustained attention ability and fluctuations in sustained attention over time, as well as the neural basis of fluctuations and lapses in performance. However, in recent years, concerns have arisen over the replicability of neuroimaging studies and psychology more broadly, particularly given the typically small sample sizes. One recently developed paradigm, the gradual-onset continuous performance task (gradCPT) has been validated behaviorally in large samples of participants. Yet neuroimaging studies investigating the neural basis of performance on this task have only been collected in small samples. The present study completed both a robust replication of the original neuroimaging findings and extended previous results from the gradCPT task using a large sample of 140 Veteran participants. Results replicate findings that fluctuations in attentional stability are tracked over time by BOLD activity in task positive (e.g., dorsal and ventral attention networks) and task negative (e.g., default network) regions. Extending prior results, we relate this coupling between attentional stability and on-going brain activity to overall sustained attention ability and demonstrate that this coupling strength, along with across-network coupling, could be used to predict individual differences in performance. Additionally, the results extend previous findings by demonstrating that temporal dynamics across the default and dorsal attention networks are associated with lapse-likelihood on subsequent trials. This study demonstrates the reliability of the gradCPT, and underscores the utility of this paradigm in understanding attentional fluctuations, as well as individual variation and deficits in sustained attention.",29307606,2018,Tracking behavioral and neural fluctuations during sustained attention: A robust replication and extension.
1168,"Inhibitory control is an important executive function that is necessary to suppress premature actions and to block interference from irrelevant stimuli. Current experimental studies and models highlight proactive and reactive mechanisms and claim several cortical and subcortical structures to be involved in response inhibition. However, the involved structures, network mechanisms and the behavioral relevance of the underlying neural activity remain debated. We report cortical EEG and invasive subthalamic local field potential recordings from a fully implanted sensing neurostimulator in Parkinson's patients during a stimulus- and response conflict task with and without deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS made reaction times faster overall while leaving the effects of conflict intact: this lack of any effect on conflict may have been inherent to our task encouraging a high level of proactive inhibition. Drift diffusion modelling hints that DBS influences decision thresholds and drift rates are modulated by stimulus conflict. Both cortical EEG and subthalamic (STN) LFP oscillations reflected reaction times (RT). With these results, we provide a different interpretation of previously conflict-related oscillations in the STN and suggest that the STN implements a general task-specific decision threshold. The timecourse and topography of subthalamic-cortical oscillatory connectivity suggest the involvement of motor, frontal midline and posterior regions in a larger network with complementary functionality, oscillatory mechanisms and structures. While beta oscillations are functionally associated with motor cortical-subthalamic connectivity, low frequency oscillations reveal a subthalamic-frontal-posterior network. With our results, we suggest that proactive as well as reactive mechanisms and structures are involved in implementing a task-related dynamic inhibitory signal. We propose that motor and executive control networks with complementary oscillatory mechanisms are tonically active, react to stimuli and release inhibition at the response when uncertainty is resolved and return to their default state afterwards.",29307607,2018,"Subthalamic stimulation, oscillatory activity and connectivity reveal functional role of STN and network mechanisms during decision making under conflict."
1169,"Learning requires the traversal of inherently distinct cognitive states to produce behavioral adaptation. Yet, tools to explicitly measure these states with non-invasive imaging - and to assess their dynamics during learning - remain limited. Here, we describe an approach based on a distinct application of graph theory in which points in time are represented by network nodes, and similarities in brain states between two different time points are represented as network edges. We use a graph-based clustering technique to identify clusters of time points representing canonical brain states, and to assess the manner in which the brain moves from one state to another as learning progresses. We observe the presence of two primary states characterized by either high activation in sensorimotor cortex or high activation in a frontal-subcortical system. Flexible switching among these primary states and other less common states becomes more frequent as learning progresses, and is inversely correlated with individual differences in learning rate. These results are consistent with the notion that the development of automaticity is associated with a greater freedom to use cognitive resources for other processes. Taken together, our work offers new insights into the constrained, low dimensional nature of brain dynamics characteristic of early learning, which give way to less constrained, high-dimensional dynamics in later learning.",29309897,2018,Brain state flexibility accompanies motor-skill acquisition.
1170,"A one year audit was undertaken of the mental health (MH) status of adult attendees to the Thames Valley Sexual Assault Centres (SARC). There were 301 relevant referrals over the twelve month period of whom 126 (42%) either fully or partially completed the mental health assessments. 38% (n = 66) of the population did not consent to the research. Participation in the study was felt inappropriate by the case clinician in the rest of the cases. To summarise the findings: 36% were moderately or severely depressed; 30% experienced moderate to severe anxiety; 28% were drinking at hazardous/harmful levels; and 12% had a drug problem that was moderate to severe. Self harm affected 45% of the sample with the greater majority cutting themselves and self-harming before the age of 17. Admission to a psychiatric in-patient unit was not uncommon and 19% had been admitted an average of three times each. The figure of 19% admitted to a psychiatric hospital is 90 times higher than for the general female population. 42% of the total sample were being prescribed medication for their mental health problem. The paper concludes that: there should be agreement nationally on the use of a standardised set of mental health outcome measures which are used in all assessments; there should be a move towards the commissioning of expert psychological support that is offered in a SARC and the pathways for specialist mental health care out of the SARCs.

Unhealthy lifestyles are a major factor in the development and exacerbation of many chronic diseases. Improving lifestyles though immersive residential experiences that promote healthy behaviours is a focus of the health retreat industry. This systematic review aims to identify and explore published studies on the health, wellbeing and economic impact of retreat experiences.


METHODS
MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases were searched for residential retreat studies in English published prior to February 2017. Studies were included if they were written in English, involved an intervention program in a residential setting of one or more nights, and included before-and-after data related to the health of participants. Studies that did not meet the above criteria or contained only descriptive data from interviews or case studies were excluded.


RESULTS
A total of 23 studies including eight randomised controlled trials, six non-randomised controlled trials and nine longitudinal cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 2592 participants from diverse geographical and demographic populations and a great heterogeneity of outcome measures, with seven studies examining objective outcomes such as blood pressure or biological makers of disease, and 16 studies examining subjective outcomes that mostly involved self-reported questionnaires on psychological and spiritual measures. All studies reported post-retreat health benefits ranging from immediately after to five-years post-retreat. Study populations varied widely and most studies had small sample sizes, poorly described methodology and little follow-up data, and no studies reported on health economic outcomes or adverse effects, making it difficult to make definite conclusions about specific conditions, safety or return on investment.


CONCLUSIONS
Health retreat experiences appear to have health benefits that include benefits for people with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, various cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart conditions and mental health. Future research with larger numbers of subjects and longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate the health impact of different retreat experiences and the clinical populations most likely to benefit.

1173,"BACKGROUND
Behavioral studies demonstrated that the administration of Withania somnifera Dunal roots extract (WSE), prolongs morphine-elicited analgesia and reduces the development of tolerance to the morphine's analgesic effect; however, little is known about the underpinning molecular mechanism(s). In order to shed light on this issue in the present paper we explored whether WSE promotes alterations of μ (MOP) and nociceptin (NOP) opioid receptors gene expression in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.


METHODS
A range of WSE concentrations was preliminarily tested to evaluate their effects on cell viability. Subsequently, the effects of 5 h exposure to WSE (0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 mg/ml), applied alone and in combination with morphine or naloxone, on MOP and NOP mRNA levels were investigated.


RESULTS
Data analysis revealed that morphine decreased MOP and NOP receptor gene expression, whereas naloxone elicited their up-regulation. In addition, pre-treatment with naloxone prevented the morphine-elicited gene expression alterations. Interestingly, WSE was able to: a) alter MOP but not NOP gene expression; b) counteract, at its highest concentration, morphine-induced MOP down-regulation, and c) hamper naloxone-induced MOP and NOP up-regulation.


CONCLUSION
Present in-vitro data disclose novel evidence about the ability of WSE to influence MOP and NOP opioid receptors gene expression in SH-SY5Y cells.

Recently, our group has reported on the positive relationship between viscoelasticity of the hippocampus and performance on a relational memory task in healthy young adults, which highlighted the potential of sensitive MRE measures for studying brain health and its relation to cognitive function; however, structure-function relationships outside of the hippocampus have not yet been explored. In this study, we examined the relationships between viscoelasticity of both the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex and performance on behavioral assessments of relational memory and fluid intelligence. In a sample of healthy, young adults (N = 53), there was a significant, positive relationship between orbitofrontal cortex viscoelasticity and fluid intelligence performance (r = 0.42; p = .002).

A central spatially informative cue, and its ensuing target, were presented to the same or different eyes at varying cue-target intervals. Results indicated that the onset of endogenous orienting was apparent earlier when the cue and target were presented to the same eye.

1176,"BACKGROUND
The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for older, heavy lifetime smokers to complete annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans of the chest as screening for lung cancer. The USPSTF recommends and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require shared decision making using a decision aid for lung cancer screening with annual LDCT. Little is known about how decision aids affect screening knowledge, preferences, and behavior. Thus, we tested a lung cancer screening decision aid video in screening-eligible primary care patients.


METHODS
We conducted a single-group study with surveys before and after decision aid viewing and medical record review at 3 months. Participants were active patients of a large US academic primary care practice who were current or former smokers, ages 55-80 years, and eligible for screening based on current screening guidelines. Outcomes assessed pre-post decision aid viewing were screening-related knowledge score (9 items about screening-related harms of false positives and overdiagnosis, likelihood of benefit; score range = 0-9) and preference (preferred screening vs. not). Screening behavior measures, assessed via chart review, included provider visits, screening discussion, LDCT ordering, and LDCT completion within 3 months.


RESULTS
Among 50 participants, knowledge increased from pre- to post-decision aid viewing (mean = 2.6 vs. 5.5, difference = 2.8; 95% CI 2.1, 3.6, p < 0.001). Preferences across the overall sample remained similar such that 54% preferred screening at baseline and 50% after viewing; however, 28% of participants changed their preference (to or away from screening) from baseline to after viewing. We assessed screening behavior for 36 participants who had a primary care visit during the 3-month period following enrollment. Eighteen of 36 preferred screening after decision aid viewing. Of these 18, 10 discussed screening, 8 had a test ordered, and 6 completed LDCT. Among the 18 who preferred no screening, 7 discussed screening, 5 had a test ordered, and 4 completed LDCT.


CONCLUSIONS
In primary care patients, a lung cancer screening decision aid improved knowledge regarding screening-related benefits and harms. Screening preferences and behavior were heterogeneous.

Previous histochemical studies identified multiple neurotransmitters in the pluteus larvae of several sea urchin species. However, little is known about how, where and when neural subtypes are differentially specified during development. Here, we examine the molecular mechanisms of neuronal subtype specification in 3 distinct neural subtypes in the Lytechinus variegatus larva. We show that these subtypes are specified through Delta/Notch signaling and identify a different transcription factor required for the development of each neural subtype. Our results show achaete-scute and neurogenin are proneural for the serotonergic neurons of the apical organ and cholinergic neurons of the ciliary band, respectively. We also show that orthopedia is not proneural but is necessary for the differentiation of the cholinergic/catecholaminergic postoral neurons.

1179,"In a verbal fluency task, a person is required to produce as many exemplars of a given category (e.g., 'animals', or words starting with 'f') as possible within a fixed duration. Successful verbal fluency performance relies both on the depth of search within semantic/phonological neighborhoods ('clustering') and the ability to flexibly disengage between exhausted clusters ('switching'). Convergent evidence from functional imaging and neuropsychology suggests that cluster-switch behaviors engage dissociable brain regions. Switching has been linked to a frontoparietal network dedicated to executive functioning and controlled lexical retrieval, whereas clustering is more commonly associated with temporal lobe regions dedicated to semantic and phonological processing. Here we attempted to modulate cluster-switch dynamics among neurotypical adults (N = 24) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) delivered at three sites: a) anterior temporal cortex; b) frontal cortex; and c) temporoparietal cortex. Participants completed letter-guided and semantic category verbal fluency tasks pre/post stimulation. Cathodal stimulation of anterior temporal cortex facilitated the total number of words generated and the number of words generated within clusters during semantic category verbal fluency. These neuromodulatory effects were specific to stimulation of the one anatomical site. Our findings highlight the role of the anterior temporal lobes in representing semantic category structure and support the claim that clustering and switching behaviors have distinct substrates. We discuss implications both for theory and application to neurorehabilitation.",29337133,2018,Cathodal tDCS of the bilateral anterior temporal lobes facilitates semantically-driven verbal fluency.
1180,"Adverse juvenile experiences, including physical abuse, often have negative health consequences later in life. We investigated the influence of social defeat stress exposure as juveniles on neuropsychological behaviors, and the causal role of glucocorticoids in abnormal behaviors and impairment of neurogenesis in mice exposed to the stress. The juvenile (24-day-old) and adult (70-day-old) male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to social defeat stress induced by an aggressive ICR mouse. Social defeat stress exposure as juveniles, even for 1 day, induced persistent social avoidance to the unfamiliar ICR mouse in the social interaction test, but that was not observed in mice exposed to the stress as adults. Social avoidance by the stress exposure as juveniles for 10 consecutive days was observed, when the target mouse was not only unfamiliar ICR but also another C57BL/J mouse, but not an absent or an anesthetized ICR mouse. The stress exposure did not induce anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in spontaneous locomotor activity, elevated plus-maze test, marble-burying test, forced swimming test, or sucrose preference test. Serum corticosterone levels increased immediately after the stress exposure. The hippocampal neurogenesis was suppressed 1 day and 4 weeks after the stress exposure. Administration of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prior to each stress exposure, blocked the persistent social avoidance and suppression of neurogenesis. In conclusion, social avoidance induced by social defeat stress exposure as juveniles are more persistent than that as adults. These social avoidances are associated with suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis via glucocorticoid receptors.",29337227,2018,Juvenile social defeat stress exposure persistently impairs social behaviors and neurogenesis.
1181,"Tau protein participates in microtubule stabilization, axonal transport, and protein trafficking. Loss of normal tau function will exert a negative effect. However, current knowledge on the impact of tau deficiency on the motor behavior and related neurobiological changes is controversial. In this study, we examined motor functions and analyzed several proteins implicated in the maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons (mDANs) function of adult and aged tau+/+, tau+/-, tau-/- mice. We found tau deficiency could not induce significant motor disorders. However, we discovered lower expression levels of transcription factors Orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) of mDANs in older aged mice. Compared with age-matched tau+/+ mice, there were 54.1% lower (p = 0.0192) OTX2 protein (OTX2-fluorescence intensity) in VTA DA neurons of tau+/- mice and 43.6% lower (p = 0.0249) OTX2 protein in VTA DA neurons of tau-/- mice at 18 months old. Combined with the relevant reports, our results suggested that tau deficiency alone might not be enough to mimic the pathology of Parkinson's disease. However, OTX2 down-regulation indicates that mDANs of tau-deficient mice will be more sensitive to toxic damage from MPTP.",29337233,2018,Tau Deficiency Down-Regulated Transcription Factor Orthodenticle Homeobox 2 Expression in the Dopaminergic Neurons in Ventral Tegmental Area and Caused No Obvious Motor Deficits in Mice.
1182,"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder reported to compromise about 1% of the world's population. Although its pathophysiological process is not completely elucidated, evidence showing the presence of an oxidative imbalance has been increasingly highlighted in the literature. Thus, the use of antioxidant substances may be of importance for schizophrenia treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavioral and oxidative alterations by the combination of chlorpromazine (CP) and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a potent antioxidant, in the ketamine (KET) model of schizophrenia in rats. Male Wistar rats (200-300 g) were treated for 10 days with saline, CP or ALA alone or in combination with CP previous to KET and the behavioral (open field, Y-maze and PPI tests) and oxidative tests were performed on the last day of treatment. The results showed that KET induced hyperlocomotion, impaired working memory and decreased PPI. CP alone or in combination with ALA prevented KET-induced behavioral effects. In addition, the administration of KET decreased GSH and increased nitrite, lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase activity. CP alone or combined with ALA prevented the oxidative alterations induced by KET. In conclusion, the treatment with KET in rats induced behavioral impairments accompanied by hippocampal oxidative alterations, possibly related to NMDA receptors hypofunction. Besides that, CP alone or combined with ALA prevented these effects, showing a beneficial activity as antipsychotic agents.",29337238,2018,Advantages of the Alpha-lipoic Acid Association with Chlorpromazine in a Model of Schizophrenia Induced by Ketamine in Rats: Behavioral and Oxidative Stress evidences.
1183,"Cooperation is ubiquitous in biological and social systems, even though cooperative behavior is often costly and at risk of exploitation by non-cooperators. Several studies have demonstrated that indirect reciprocity, whereby some members of a group observe the behaviors of their peers and use this information to discriminate against previously uncooperative agents in the future, can promote prosocial behavior. Some studies have shown that differential propensities of interacting among and between different types of agents (interaction assortment) can increase the effectiveness of indirect reciprocity. No previous studies have, however, considered differential propensities of observing the behaviors of different types of agents (information assortment). Furthermore, most previous studies have assumed that discriminators possess perfect information about others and incur no costs for gathering and storing this information. Here, we (1) consider both interaction assortment and information assortment, (2) assume discriminators have limited information about others, and (3) introduce a cost for information gathering and storage, in order to understand how the ability of discriminators to stabilize cooperation is affected by these steps toward increased realism. We report the following findings. First, cooperation can persist when agents preferentially interact with agents of other types or when discriminators preferentially observe other discriminators, even when they have limited information. Second, contrary to intuition, increasing the amount of information available to discriminators can exacerbate defection. Third, introducing costs of gathering and storing information makes it more difficult for discriminators to stabilize cooperation. Our study is one of only a few studies to date that show how negative interaction assortment can promote cooperation and broadens the set of circumstances in which it is know that cooperation can be maintained.",29337264,2018,Indirect reciprocity with negative assortment and limited information can promote cooperation.
1184,"A major limitation to structural and functional MRI (fMRI) scans is their susceptibility to head motion artifacts. Even submillimeter movements can systematically distort functional connectivity, morphometric, and diffusion imaging results. In patient care, sedation is often used to minimize head motion, but it incurs increased costs and risks. In research settings, sedation is typically not an ethical option. Therefore, safe methods that reduce head motion are critical for improving MRI quality, especially in high movement individuals such as children and neuropsychiatric patients. We investigated the effects of (1) viewing movies and (2) receiving real-time visual feedback about head movement in 24 children (5-15 years old). Children completed fMRI scans during which they viewed a fixation cross (i.e., rest) or a cartoon movie clip, and during some of the scans they also received real-time visual feedback about head motion. Head motion was significantly reduced during movie watching compared to rest and when receiving feedback compared to receiving no feedback. However, these results depended on age, such that the effects were largely driven by the younger children. Children older than 10 years showed no significant benefit. We also found that viewing movies significantly altered the functional connectivity of fMRI data, suggesting that fMRI scans during movies cannot be equated to standard resting-state fMRI scans. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) given the reduction in head motion with behavioral interventions, these methods should be tried first for all clinical and structural MRIs in lieu of sedation; and (2) for fMRI research scans, these methods can reduce head motion in certain groups, but investigators must keep in mind the effects on functional MRI data.",29337280,2018,Behavioral interventions for reducing head motion during MRI scans in children.
1185,"Tryptophan (Trp) has been associated with the regulation of several behavioral and physiological processes, through stimulation of serotonergic activity. Tryptophan utilization at the metabolic level is influenced by the competitive carrier system it shares with large neutral amino acids (LNAA). This study was carried out using meat-type chicken as a model, to investigate the dose response effects of Trp/LNAA on fear response (tonic immobility; TI) and hormonal responses, including corticosterone (CORT), serotonin (5-HT), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). A total of 12 cages (48 birds) were assigned to each of the six experimental groups at 29-42 days of age. Experimental diets were formulated to have incremental levels of Trp/LNAA (0.025, 0.030, 0.035, 0.040, 0.045, and 0.050). The results revealed that, Trp/NAA had no significant effect on growth performance and TI of the birds. However, elevation of Trp/LNAA was concurred with a linear reduction in CORT (P < .0001, r2 = 0.819) and linear increases in 5-HT (P < .0001, r2 = 0.945), T3 (P = .0003, r2 = 0.403) and T4 (P < .0001, r2 = 0.937) levels. In conclusion, the results from the current study demonstrated that, although incremental levels of Trp/LNAA did not affect bird growth performance or fearfulness, it increased 5-HT, T3 and T4, and decreased CORT levels in a linear dose-dependent manner. Manipulation of Trp feeding levels could be applied to manage stressful conditions in birds.",29339185,2018,"Dose-response relationship of tryptophan with large neutral amino acids, and its impact on physiological responses in the chick model."
1186,"Psychological construction models of emotion state that emotions are variable concepts constructed by fundamental psychological processes, whereas according to basic emotion theory, emotions cannot be divided into more fundamental units and each basic emotion is represented by a unique and innate neural circuitry. In a previous study, we found evidence for the psychological construction account by showing that several brain regions were commonly activated when perceiving different emotions (i.e. a general emotion network). Moreover, this set of brain regions included areas associated with core affect, conceptualization and executive control, as predicted by psychological construction models. Here we investigate directed functional brain connectivity in the same dataset to address two questions: 1) is there a common pathway within the general emotion network for the perception of different emotions and 2) if so, does this common pathway contain information to distinguish between different emotions? We used generalized psychophysiological interactions and information flow indices to examine the connectivity within the general emotion network. The results revealed a general emotion pathway that connects neural nodes involved in core affect, conceptualization, language and executive control. Perception of different emotions could not be accurately classified based on the connectivity patterns from the nodes of the general emotion pathway. Successful classification was achieved when connections outside the general emotion pathway were included. We propose that the general emotion pathway functions as a common pathway within the general emotion network and is involved in shared basic psychological processes across emotions. However, additional connections within the general emotion network are required to classify different emotions, consistent with a constructionist account.",29339312,2018,Studying emotion theories through connectivity analysis: Evidence from generalized psychophysiological interactions and graph theory.
1187,"The androgen derivative androstadienone (AND) is a substance found in human sweat and thus may act as human chemosignal. With the current experiment, we aimed to explore in which way AND affects interference processing during an emotional Stroop task which used human faces as target and emotional words as distractor stimuli. This was complemented by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to unravel the neural mechanism of AND-action. Based on previous accounts we expected AND to increase neural activation in areas commonly implicated in evaluation of emotional face processing and to change neural activation in brain regions linked to interference processing. For this aim, a total of 80 healthy individuals (oral contraceptive users, luteal women, men) were tested twice on two consecutive days with an emotional Stroop task using fMRI. Our results suggest that AND increases interference processing in brain areas that are heavily recruited during emotional conflict. At the same time, correlation analyses revealed that this neural interference processing was paralleled by higher behavioral costs (response times) with higher interference related brain activation under AND. Furthermore, AND elicited higher activation in regions implicated in emotional face processing including right fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and dorsomedial cortex. In this connection, neural activation was not coupled to behavioral outcome. Furthermore, despite previous accounts of increased hypothalamic activation under AND, we were not able to replicate this finding and discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. To conclude, AND increased interference processing in regions heavily recruited during emotional conflict which was coupled to higher costs in resolving emotional conflicts with stronger interference-related brain activation under AND. At the moment it remains unclear whether these effects are due to changes in conflict detection or resolution. However, evidence most consistently suggests that AND does not draw attention to the most potent socio-emotional information (human faces) but rather highlights representations of emotional words.",29339313,2018,The human body odor compound androstadienone increases neural conflict coupled to higher behavioral costs during an emotional Stroop task.
1188,"PURPOSE
There is a paucity of research exploring individuals' memories of parental dieting behavior, engagement in ""fat talk"", or criticism of weight or eating behavior in childhood. This exploratory study utilized a community sample to further characterize the retrospective report of parenting dieting behavior.


METHODS
A total of 507 participants (78.1% females; 20.7% males; and 1.2% transgender) were recruited to participate in an online, self-administered survey.


RESULTS
Forty percent (216) of participants reported maternal dieting in their family of origin and 34% (182) reported maternal fat talk, 24% (120) reported paternal dieting, and 11% recalled paternal 'fat talk' (58). Subgroup analyses suggest that both male and female participants had greater odds of remembering maternal rather than paternal weight or shape criticism and encouragement to diet (OR = 58.1; and OR = 3.12; p < 0.0001 for male and female participants, respectively). Retrospective report of indirect parental behaviors (e.g. parental dieting) also appears to be associated with direct parental behaviors (e.g. encouraging children to diet). Additionally, participants who recalled maternal encouragement to diet reported a significantly higher adult BMI (β = 1.31, SE = 0.32, p < 0.0001).


CONCLUSION
Results provide preliminary evidence that a sizeable percentage of both adult male and female participants recalled that their parents engaged in fat talk and dieting. In addition, participants recalled parental criticism of their own weight or eating behaviors, which was associated with recall of parental dieting and fat talk.

The present study sought to elucidate the combinatorial effects of early-life maternal separation stress and adult social defeat stress on alterations in signal transduction and gene expression that have been previously implicated in susceptibility to psychosocial stress. Molecular analyses were performed in the prelimbic/infralimbic cortex, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, three brain regions that have been suggested to play critical roles in determining stress responses. The current data reveal that both maternal separation and social defeat significantly impact the expression of genes involved in histone methylation and the β-catenin-, endogenous opioid-, neurotrophin-, and glucocorticoid signaling pathways. Although the effects of maternal separation and social defeat were largely non-overlapping, a subset of genes in each brain region were governed by additive, opposing, or other types of interactions between these stress paradigms, thus highlighting potential molecular mechanisms through which these stressors might coordinately regulate brain function and behavior.",29341883,2018,Brain-region-specific Molecular Responses to Maternal Separation and Social Defeat Stress in Mice.
1190,"Stress is a physiological state characterized by altered neuroendocrine signaling, behavioral arousal, and anxiety. Chronic or traumatic stress may predispose individuals for multiple somatic and psychiatric illnesses. The locus coeruleus (LC) is a major node in the stress response that integrates input from multiple stress responsive neural circuits and releases norepinephrine (NE) throughout the central nervous system (CNS) to promote vigilance and anxiety. Many mood disorders associated with prior stress are characterized by chronically altered noradrenergic signaling, yet the long-term impact of an acute stressor on LC function is not clear. To determine how acute stress could affect anxiety-like behavior as well as LC function at immediate and extended time points, rats underwent simultaneous exposure to physical restraint and predator odor. Rats underwent behavioral testing immediately or one week after stressor exposure and were then sacrificed for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of LC neurons. Stress caused an immediate increase in anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze (EPM), as well decreased excitatory synaptic transmission and increased spontaneous discharge in LC neurons. These effects persisted for seven days after stress. Importantly, the excitability of LC neurons was increased one week post-stress, but not immediately after, suggesting a long-term adaptation by the system. Rats tested in the open field one week after stress also showed increased anxiety-like behaviors. These findings show that a single acute stressor is capable of precipitating long-lasting changes in the LC function that may be related to some of the behavioral effects of stress, potentially contributing to stress-induced disease pathogenesis.",29341884,2018,Acute Stress Persistently Alters Locus Coeruleus Function and Anxiety-like Behavior in Adolescent Rats.

Because little is known about the factors underlying this comorbidity, we investigated the effects of adolescent stress on anxiety-like behavior and nicotine responses within individual animals. Adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic variable social stress (CVSS; repeated cycles of social isolation + social reorganization) or control conditions from postnatal days (PND) 25-59. Anxiety-like behavior and social avoidance were measured in the elevated plus-maze (PND 61-65) and social approach-avoidance test (Experiment 1: PND 140-144; Experiment 2: 95-97), respectively. Acute nicotine-induced locomotor, hypothermic, corticosterone responses, (Experiment 1: PND 56-59; Experiment 2: PND 65-70) and voluntary oral nicotine consumption (Experiment 1: PND 116-135; Experiment 2: 73-92) were also examined. Finally, we assessed prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAC) synaptic transmission (PND 64-80); brain regions that are implicated in anxiety and addiction. Mice exposed to adolescent CVSS displayed increased anxiety-like behavior relative to controls. Further, CVSS altered synaptic excitability in PFC and NAC neurons in a sex-specific manner. For males, CVSS decreased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in the PFC and NAC, respectively. In females, CVSS decreased the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the NAC. Adolescent CVSS did not affect social avoidance or nicotine responses and anxiety-like behavior was not reliably associated with nicotine responses within individual animals. Taken together, complex interactions between PFC and NAC function may contribute to adolescent stress-induced anxiety-like behavior without influencing nicotine responses.",29343455,2018,"Adolescent Social Stress Increases Anxiety-like Behavior and Alters Synaptic Transmission, Without Influencing Nicotine Responses, in a Sex-Dependent Manner."

In this sense, bisphosphonates that are clinically used for bone diseases have been studied as agents against Trypanosoma cruzi, causative parasite of Chagas disease. In this work, the development of first row transition metal complexes (M = Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+) with the bisphosphonate ibandronate (iba, H4iba representing the neutral form) is presented. The in-solution behavior of the systems containing iba and the selected 3d metal ions was studied by potentiometry. Mononuclear complexes [M(Hxiba)](2-x)- (x = 0-3) and [M(Hiba)2]4- together with the formation of the neutral polynuclear species [M2iba] and [M3(Hiba)2] were detected for all studied systems. In the solid state, complexes of the formula [M3(Hiba)2(H2O)4]·6H2O were obtained and characterized. All obtained complexes, forming [M(Hiba)]- species under the conditions of the biological studies, were more active against the amastigote form of T. cruzi than the free iba, showing no toxicity in mammalian Vero cells. In addition, the same complexes were selective inhibitors of the parasitic farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) enzyme showing poor inhibition of the human one. However, the increase of the anti-T. cruzi activity upon coordination could not be explained neither through the inhibition of TcFPPS nor through the inhibition of TcSPPS (T. cruzi solanesyl-diphosphate synthase).

1193,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
Compare nocturnal REM sleep without atonia (nRWA) and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) between pediatric patients with and without narcolepsy and determine if the nRWA index is a valid diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy.


METHODS
Retrospective cohort study of children ages 6 to 18 years who completed a nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Our study sample included 11 patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 6 with narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), 12 with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), and 11 with subjective hypersomnia (sHS). We compared group nRWA indices (epochs of RWA/total stage R sleep epochs) from the nocturnal PSGs and analyzed nRWA index receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics for narcolepsy diagnosis.


RESULTS
The median nRWA index of patients with NT1 was 15 to 30 times higher compared to sHS and IH (Ps < .005) but similar to that of the NT2 group (P = .46). RBD was present in 25% of patients with narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2). In comparing those with and without narcolepsy, the nRWA index area under the curve was 0.87 (0.6), 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75 to 0.99, P < .001. The threshold of having ≥ 1% of stage R sleep epochs with nRWA yielded a sensitivity of 88.2%, 95% CI = 63.6-98.5 and specificity of 60.9%, 95% CI = 38.5 to 80.3 for diagnosis of narcolepsy. In contrast, a threshold of ≥ 8% yielded a specificity of 95.7%, 95% CI = 78.1 to 99.9 and sensitivity of 52.9%, 95% CI = 27.8 to 77.

1194,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Adolescents with depression identified in primary care settings often have limited treatment options beyond antidepressant (AD) therapy. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program among depressed adolescents who declined or quickly stopped using ADs.


METHODS
A total of 212 youth with depression were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus brief individual CBT. Clinical outcomes included depression-free days (DFDs) and estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were adjusted to 2008 US dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing CBT to TAU were calculated over 12- and 24-month follow-up periods.


RESULTS
Youth randomly assigned to CBT had 26.8 more DFDs (P = .044) and 0.067 more QALYs (P = .044) on average compared with TAU over 12 months. Total costs were $4976 less (P = .025) by the end of the 24-month follow-up among youth randomly assigned to CBT. Total costs per DFD were -$51 (ICER = -$51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -$394 to $9) at 12 months and -$115 (ICER = -$115; 95% CI: -$1090 to -$6) at 24 months. Total costs per QALY were -$20 282 (ICER = -$20 282; 95% CI: -$156 741 to $3617) at 12 months and -$45 792 (ICER = -$45 792; 95% CI: -$440 991 to -$2731) at 24 months.

Moreover, stress hormones are known to slow DNA repair, suggesting that prolonged stress may result in persistent DNA damage. Prolonged stress is known to negatively impact physical and mental health; however, DNA damage as a factor in stress pathology has only begun to be explored. Histone H2A-X phosphorylated at serine 139 (γH2AX) is a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), a type of damage that may lead to cell death if unrepaired. We hypothesized that a 14-day period of variable stress exposure sufficient to alter anxiety-like behavior in male C57BL/6J mice would produce an increase in γH2AX levels in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a region implicated in anxiety and stress regulation. We observed that 14 days of variable stress, but not a single stress exposure, was associated with increased levels of γH2AX 24 h after termination of the stress paradigm. Further investigation found that phosphorylation levels of a pair of kinases associated with the DNA damage response, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also elevated following variable stress. Our results suggest that unrepaired DNA DSBs and/or repetitive attempted repair may represent an important component of the allostatic load that stress places on the brain.",29352998,2018,Two Weeks of Variable Stress Increases Gamma-H2AX Levels in the Mouse Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis.
1196,"OBJECTIVE
Acrolein, a highly reactive unsaturated aldehyde, is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and oxidative damage induced by acrolein is hypothesized to involve in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Calorie restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention that has consistently been verified to retard aging by ameliorating oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CR on acrolein-induced neurotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.


METHODS
A total of 45 weaned and specific-pathogen-free SD rats (male, weighing 180-220 g) were gavage-fed with acrolein (2.5 mg/kg/day) and fed ab libitum of 10 g/day or 7 g/day (representing 30% CR regimen), or gavage-fed with same volume of tap water and fed al libitum as vehicle control for 12 weeks. After behavioral test conducted by Morris Water Maze, SD rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were prepared for histochemical evaluation and Western blotting to detect alterations in oxidative stress, BDNF/TrkB pathway and key enzymes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism.


RESULTS
Treatment with 30% CR in SD rats significantly attenuated acrolein-induced cognitive impairment. Oxidative damage including deletion of glutathione and superoxide dismutase and sharp rise in malondialdehyde were notably improved by 30% CR. Further study suggested that 30% CR showed protective effects against acrolein by modulating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways. Moreover, 30% CR restored acrolein-induced changes of APP, β-secretase, α-secretase and receptor for advanced glycation end products.

1197,"Despite evidence from psychiatry and psychology clinics pointing to altered cognition and decision making following the consumption of cannabis, the effects of cannabis derivatives are still under dispute and the mechanisms of cannabinoid effects on cognition are not known. In this study, we used effort-based and delay-based decision tasks and showed that ACEA, a potent cannabinoid agonist induced apathetic and impulsive patterns of choice in rats in a dose-dependent manner when locally injected into the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively. Pre-treatment with AM251, a selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, reversed ACEA-induced impulsive and apathetic patterns of choice in doses higher than a minimally effective dose. Unlike CB1 receptor antagonist, pretreatment with capsazepine, a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel antagonist, was effective only at an intermediary dose. Furthermore, capsazepine per se induced impulsivity and apathy at a high dose suggesting a basal tonic activation of TRPV1 channels that exist in the ACC and OFC to support cost-benefit decision making and to help avoid apathetic and impulsive patterns of decision making. Taken together, unlike previous reports supporting opposing roles for the CB1 receptors and TRPV1 channels in anxiety and panic behavior, our findings demonstrate a different sort of interaction between endocannabinoid and endovanilloid systems and suggest that both systems contribute to the cognitive disrupting effects of cannabinoids. Given prevalent occurrence of apathy and particularly impulsivity in psychiatric disorders, these results have significant implications for pharmacotherapy research targeting these receptors.",29355640,2018,Cannabinoids induce apathetic and impulsive patterns of choice through CB1 receptors and TRPV1 channels.
1198,"Recent studies indicate an important role for the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP), and its regulatory pathway Hippo, in controlling cell growth and fate during lens development; however, the exogenous factors that promote this pathway are yet to be identified. Given that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-signaling is an established regulator of lens cell behavior, the current study investigates the relationship between this pathway and Hippo/YAP-signaling during lens cell proliferation and fibre differentiation. Rat lens epithelial explants were cultured with FGF2 to induce epithelial cell proliferation or fibre differentiation. Immunolabeling methods were used to detect the expression of Hippo-signaling components, Total and Phosphorylated YAP, as well as fibre cell markers, Prox-1 and β-crystallin. FGF-induced lens cell proliferation was associated with a strong nuclear localisation of Total-YAP and low-level immuno-staining for phosphorylated-YAP. FGF-induced lens fibre differentiation was associated with a significant increase in cytoplasmic phosphorylated YAP (inactive state) and enhanced expression of core Hippo-signaling components. Inhibition of YAP with Verteporfin suppressed FGF-induced lens cell proliferation and ablated cell elongation during lens fibre differentiation. Inhibition of either FGFR- or MEK/ERK-signaling suppressed FGF-promoted YAP nuclear translocation. Here we propose that FGF promotes Hippo/YAP-signaling during lens cell proliferation and differentiation, with FGF-induced nuclear-YAP expression playing an essential role in promoting the proliferation of lens epithelial cells. An FGF-induced switch from proliferation to differentiation, hence regulation of lens growth, may play a key role in mediating Hippo suppression of YAP transcriptional activity.",29355736,2018,A role for Hippo/YAP-signaling in FGF-induced lens epithelial cell proliferation and fibre differentiation.
1199,"To better understand the impact of aging, along with other demographic and brain health variables, on the neural networks that support different aspects of cognitive performance, we applied a brute-force search technique based on Principal Components Analysis to derive 4 corresponding spatial covariance patterns (termed Reference Ability Neural Networks -RANNs) from a large sample of participants across the age range. 255 clinically healthy, community-dwelling adults, aged 20-77, underwent fMRI while performing 12 tasks, 3 tasks for each of the following cognitive reference abilities: Episodic Memory, Reasoning, Perceptual Speed, and Vocabulary. The derived RANNs (1) showed selective activation to their specific cognitive domain and (2) correlated with behavioral performance. Quasi out-of-sample replication with Monte-Carlo 5-fold cross validation was built into our approach, and all patterns indicated their corresponding reference ability and predicted performance in held-out data to a degree significantly greater than chance level. RANN-pattern expression for Episodic Memory, Reasoning and Vocabulary were associated selectively with age, while the pattern for Perceptual Speed showed no such age-related influences. For each participant we also looked at residual activity unaccounted for by the RANN-pattern derived for the cognitive reference ability. Higher residual activity was associated with poorer brain-structural health and older age, but -apart from Vocabulary-not with cognitive performance, indicating that older participants with worse brain-structural health might recruit alternative neural resources to maintain performance levels.",29355766,2018,Reference ability neural networks and behavioral performance across the adult life span.
1200,"Ras proteins are oncoproteins which play a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. All Ras proteins' signaling strongly depends on their correct localization in the cell membrane. Over 30% of cancers are driven by mutant Ras proteins, and KRas4B is the Ras isoform most frequently mutated. C6-ceramide has been shown to inhibit the growth activity of KRas4B mutated cells. However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition remains elusive. Here, we established a heterogeneous model biomembrane containing C6-ceramide. C6-ceramide incorporation does not disrupt the lipid membrane. Addition of KRas4B leads to drastic changes in the lateral membrane organization of the membrane, however. In contrast to the partitioning behavior in other membranes, KRas4B forms small, monodisperse nanoclusters dispersed in a fluid-like environment, in all likelihood induced by some kind of lipid sorting mechanism. Fluorescence cross-correlation data indicate no direct interaction between C6-ceramide and KRas4B, suggesting that KRas4B essentially recruits other lipids. A FRET-based binding assay reveals that the stability of KRas4B proteins inserted into the membrane containing C6-ceramide is reduced. Based on the combined results obtained, we postulate a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of KRas4B mutated cells' activity through C6-ceramide.",29357287,2018,Interaction of KRas4B protein with C6-ceramide containing lipid model membranes.
1201,"Wolfram syndrome (WS), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene (WFS1), is characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, bilateral optic atrophy, and a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein, and mutations in this gene lead to pancreatic β-cell death induced by high levels of ER stress. However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration caused by WFS1 deficiency remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of WFS1 in the maintenance of neuronal integrity in vivo by knocking down the expression of wfs1, the Drosophila homolog of WFS1, in the central nervous system. Neuronal knockdown of wfs1 caused age-dependent behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration in the fly brain. Knockdown of wfs1 in neurons and glial cells resulted in premature death and significantly exacerbated behavioral deficits in flies, suggesting that wfs1 has important functions in both cell types. Although wfs1 knockdown alone did not promote ER stress, it increased the susceptibility to oxidative stress-, excitotoxicity- or tauopathy-induced behavioral deficits, and neurodegeneration. The glutamate release inhibitor riluzole significantly suppressed premature death phenotypes induced by neuronal and glial knockdown of wfs1. This study highlights the protective role of wfs1 against age-associated neurodegeneration and furthers our understanding of potential disease-modifying factors that determine susceptibility and resilience to age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",29357349,2018,"Knockdown of wfs1, a fly homolog of Wolfram syndrome 1, in the nervous system increases susceptibility to age- and stress-induced neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in Drosophila."
1202,"Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.",29357357,2018,What drives the perceptual change resulting from speech motor adaptation?

1203,"Phenotypic integration and modularity represent important factors influencing evolutionary change. The mammalian cervical vertebral column is particularly interesting in regards to integration and modularity because it is highly constrained to seven elements, despite widely variable morphology. Previous research has found a common pattern of integration among quadrupedal mammals, but integration patterns also evolve in response to locomotor selective pressures like those associated with hominin bipedalism. Here, I test patterns of covariation in the cervical vertebrae of three hominoid primates (Hylobates, Pan, Homo) who engage in upright postures and locomotion. Patterns of integration in the hominoid cervical vertebrae correspond generally to those previously found in other mammals, suggesting that integration in this region is highly conserved, even among taxa that engage in novel positional behaviors. These integration patterns reflect underlying developmental as well as functional modules. The strong integration between vertebrae suggests that the functional morphology of the cervical vertebral column should be considered as a whole, rather than in individual vertebrae. Taxa that display highly derived morphologies in the cervical vertebrae are likely exploiting these integration patterns, rather than reorganizing them. Future work on vertebrates without cervical vertebral number constraints will further clarify the evolution of integration in this region.",29359326,2018,Phenotypic integration of the cervical vertebrae in the Hominoidea (Primates).

We have analyzed and discussed three examples of synchronization in biosystems, including the direction-changing movement of paramecia, the prey behavior of flytraps, and the simultaneous discharge of electric eels. These phenomena and discussions support an electrical communication mechanism that in biosystems, the electrical signals are mainly soliton-like electromagnetic pulses, which are generated by the transient transmembrane ionic current through the ion channels and propagate along the dielectric membrane-based softmaterial waveguide network to complete synchronized responses. This transmission model implies that a uniform electrical communication mechanism might have been naturally developed in biosystem.",29360451,2018,Phenomena of synchronized response in biosystems and the possible mechanism.
1205,"Sleep loss is a common problem in modern societies affecting different aspects of individuals' lives. Many studies have reported that sleep deprivation (SD) leads to impairments in various types of learning and memory. Physical exercise has been suggested to attenuate the cognitive impairments induced by sleep deprivation in male rats. Our previous studies have shown that forced exercise by treadmill improved learning and memory impairments following SD. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of voluntary exercise by running wheel on cognitive, motor and anxiety-like behavior functions of female rats following 72 h SD. Intact female rats were used in the present study. The multiple platform method was applied for the induction of 72 h SD. The exercise protocol was 4 weeks of running wheel and the cognitive function was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM), passive avoidance and novel object recognition tests. Open field test and measurement of plasma corticosterone level were performed for evaluation of anxiety-like behaviors. Motor balance evaluation was surveyed by rotarod test. In this study, remarkable learning and long-term memory impairments were observed in sleep deprived rats in comparison to the other groups. Running wheel exercise ameliorated the SD-induced learning and memory impairments. Voluntary and mandatory locomotion and balance situation were not statistically significant among the different groups. Our study confirmed the negative effects of SD on cognitive function and approved protective effects of voluntary exercise on these negative effects.",29360489,2018,Voluntary exercise impact on cognitive impairments in sleep-deprived intact female rats.
1206,"Speaking more than one language is associated with neurocognitive benefits in seniors (Alladi et al. 2013). Few studies however have tested this hypothesis directly by comparing bilingual seniors who vary in chronological age. We report a Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) study showing cumulative effects of age on grey matter volume (GMV) in brain structures that are involved in cognitive control in bilingual seniors and found no differences in RT or accuracy between bilingual and monolingual seniors on a behavioral test of cognitive control called the Attentional Network Task (ANT), and no differences in GMV for selected ROIs between groups. However, chronological age predicted the size of interference and conflict effects for monolingual speakers only. We also observed a more widespread pattern of bilateral aging-effcts in brain regions that are classically associated with aging in monolingual speakers compared to bilingual speakers. Notably, GMV in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the level of daily exposure to a second language (L2) independently predict performance on the ANT in bilingual speakers. We conclude that regular (daily) bilingual experience mitigates the typical effects of aging on cognitive control at the behavioral and the neural level.",29360516,2018,Bilingualism and healthy aging: Aging effects and neural maintenance.
1207,"This study used mice to evaluate whether coupling expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) creates central interactions that blunt endocrine and behavioral responses to psychogenic stress. Central administration of diminazene aceturate, an ACE2 activator, had no effect on restraint-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; however, mice that ubiquitously overexpress ACE2 had reduced plasma corticosterone (CORT) and pituitary expression of POMC mRNA. The Cre-LoxP system was used to restrict ACE2 overexpression to CRH synthesizing cells and probe whether HPA axis suppression was the result of central ACE2 and CRH interactions. Within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), mice with ACE2 overexpression directed to CRH had a ≈2.5 fold increase in ACE2 mRNA, which co-localized with CRH mRNA. Relative to controls, mice overexpressing ACE2 in CRH cells had a decreased CORT response to restraint as well as decreased CRH mRNA in the PVN and CEA and POMC mRNA in the pituitary. Administration of ACTH similarly increased plasma CORT, indicating that the blunted HPA axis activation that accompanies ACE2 overexpression in CRH cells is centrally mediated. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed to determine whether the decreased HPA axis activation was predictive of anxiolysis. Mice with ACE2 overexpression directed to CRH cells displayed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and open field when compared to that of controls. Collectively, these results suggest that exogenous ACE2 suppresses CRH synthesis, which alters the central processing of psychogenic stress, thereby blunting HPA axis activation and attenuating anxiety-like behavior.",29360543,2018,Coupling corticotropin-releasing-hormone and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 dampens stress responsiveness in male mice.

Behavioral data, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) and induced event-related oscillations (EROs) were analyzed. At the behavioral level, deprived participants showed speeded reaction times to new stimuli. Analyses of ERPs indicated that starting from 1000 ms the recognition of old objects elicited enhanced positive amplitudes only for the visually deprived group. Visual deprivation also influenced EROs. In this sense, we observed reduced power in the lower-1 alpha band for the processing of new compared to old stimuli between 500 and 750 ms. Overall, our data showed improved haptic recognition memory after a short period of visual deprivation.

1209,"BACKGROUND
Direct-to-consumer (DTC) promotion of prescription drugs can affect consumer behaviors and health outcomes, and Internet drug promotion is growing rapidly. Branded drug websites often capitalize on the multimedia capabilities of the Internet by using videos to emphasize drug benefits and characteristics. However, it is unknown how such videos affect consumer processing of drug information.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to examine how videos on prescription drug websites, and the inclusion of risk information in those videos, influence consumer knowledge and perceptions.


METHODS
We conducted an experimental study in which online panel participants with acid reflux (n=1070) or high blood pressure (n=1055) were randomly assigned to view 1 of the 10 fictitious prescription drug websites and complete a short questionnaire. On each website, we manipulated the type of video (patient testimonial, mechanism of action animation, or none) and whether the video mentioned drug risks.


RESULTS
Participants who viewed any video were less likely to recognize drug risks presented only in the website text (P≤.01). Including risk information in videos increased participants' recognition of the risks presented in the videos (P≤.01). However, in some cases, including risk information in videos decreased participants' recognition of the risks not presented in the videos (ie, risks presented in text only; P≤.04). Participants who viewed a video without drug risk information thought that the website placed more emphasis on benefits, compared with participants who viewed the video with drug risk information (P≤.01). Compared with participants who viewed a video without drug risk information, participants who viewed a video with drug risk information thought that the drug was less effective in the high blood pressure sample (P=.03) and thought that risks were more serious in the acid reflux sample (P=.01). There were no significant differences between risk and nonrisk video conditions on other perception measures (P>.05). In addition, we noted a few differences among the types of videos.

Including risks in branded drug website videos may increase in-video risk retention at the expense of text-only risk retention.",29362205,2018,Testimonials and Informational Videos on Branded Prescription Drug Websites: Experimental Study to Assess Influence on Consumer Knowledge and Perceptions.
1210,"BACKGROUND
Paper questionnaires have traditionally been the first choice for data collection in research. However, declining response rates over the past decade have increased the risk of selection bias in cross-sectional studies. The growing use of the Internet offers new ways of collecting data, but trials using Web-based questionnaires have so far seen mixed results. A secure, online digital mailbox (e-Boks) linked to a civil registration number became mandatory for all Danish citizens in 2014 (exemption granted only in extraordinary cases). Approximately 89% of the Danish population have a digital mailbox, which is used for correspondence with public authorities.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to compare response rates, completeness of data, and financial costs for different invitation methods: traditional surface mail and digital mail.


METHODS
We designed a cross-sectional comparative study. An invitation to participate in a survey on help-seeking behavior in out-of-hours care was sent to two groups of randomly selected citizens from age groups 30-39 and 50-59 years and parents to those aged 0-4 years using either traditional surface mail (paper group) or digital mail sent to a secure online mailbox (digital group). Costs per respondent were measured by adding up all costs for handling, dispatch, printing, and work salary and then dividing the total figure by the number of respondents. Data completeness was assessed by comparing the number of missing values between the two methods. Socioeconomic variables (age, gender, family income, education duration, immigrant status, and job status) were compared both between respondents and nonrespondents and within these groups to evaluate the degree of selection bias.


RESULTS
A total 3600 citizens were invited in each group; 1303 (36.29%) responded to the digital invitation and 1653 (45.99%) to the paper invitation (difference 9.66%, 95% CI 7.40-11.92). The costs were €1.51 per respondent for the digital group and €15.67 for paper group respondents. Paper questionnaires generally had more missing values; this was significant in five of 17 variables (P<.05). Substantial differences were found in the socioeconomic variables between respondents and nonrespondents, whereas only minor differences were seen within the groups of respondents and nonrespondents.


CONCLUSIONS
Although we found lower response rates for Web-based invitations, this solution was more cost-effective (by a factor of 10) and had slightly lower numbers of missing values than questionnaires sent with paper invitations. Analyses of socioeconomic variables showed almost no difference between nonrespondents in both groups, which could imply that the lower response rate in the digital group does not necessarily increase the level of selection bias. Invitations to questionnaire studies via digital mail may be an excellent option for collecting research data in the future. This study may serve as the foundational pillar of digital data collection in health care research in Scandinavia and other countries considering implementing similar systems.",29362206,2018,"Paper- or Web-Based Questionnaire Invitations as a Method for Data Collection: Cross-Sectional Comparative Study of Differences in Response Rate, Completeness of Data, and Financial Cost."
1211,"3,4-Dichloro-N-benzamide (AH-7921) is a cyclohexyl-methylbenzamide derivative with analgesic activity, whose abuse was associated with several fatal intoxications, included in Schedule I of UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. We validated an HPLC-MS/MS method to investigate its brain disposition and metabolism after single and repeated injections; in parallel, we evaluated its central behavioral effects. After an intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg, the analgesic effect appeared after 5 min and persisted up to 4 h; brain absorption was rapid (tmax 30 min) and large (brain-to-plasma ratio 16), with active concentration >700 ng/g. By high-resolution MS we identified several metabolites in plasma and brain, the most important being N-demethylated and N,N-didemethylated metabolites; they showed high brain permeability, although they probably do not contribute to the analgesic effect of the parent compound (brain tmax>2 h). Starting 2 h after treatment, the two metabolites showed higher plasma and brain concentrations than the parent molecule, which persisted much longer, and could be used to evaluate drug intake in human consumers. Tolerance was observed after seven daily doses, when the compound's analgesic effect was 14% lower than after the first dose; since brain concentrations did not decrease in parallel, the development of pharmacodynamic tolerance can be suggested. However, pharmacokinetic tolerance is also likely, as brought to light by the data after a dose challenge, given after a 48 h washout period from the 7th dose, showing a lower brain-to-plasma ratio. We also describe the rewarding effect of AH-7921 (conditioned place preference), suggesting a high risk of addiction in humans.",29366664,2018,"Brain disposition, metabolism and behavioral effects of the synthetic opioid AH-7921 in rats."
1212,"Cardiolipin in eukaryotes is found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts with membrane proteins and, although not essential, is necessary for the optimal activity of a number of proteins. One of them is the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, which imports ADP into the mitochondrion and exports ATP. In the crystal structures, cardiolipin is bound to three equivalent sites of the ADP/ATP carrier, but its role is unresolved. Conservation of residues at these cardiolipin binding sites across other members of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily indicates cardiolipin binding is likely to be important for the function of all mitochondrial carriers. Multiscale simulations were performed in a cardiolipin-containing membrane to investigate the dynamics of cardiolipin around the yeast and bovine ADP/ATP carriers in a lipid bilayer and the properties of the cardiolipin-binding sites. In coarse-grain simulations, cardiolipin molecules bound to the carriers for longer periods of time than phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids-with timescales in the tens of microseconds. Three long-lived cardiolipin binding sites overlapped with those in the crystal structures of the carriers. Other shorter-lived cardiolipin interaction sites were identified in both membrane leaflets. However, the timescales of the interactions were of the same order as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting that these sites are not specific for cardiolipin binding. The calculation of lipid binding times and the overlap of the cardiolipin binding sites between the structures and simulations demonstrate the potential of multiscale simulations to investigate the dynamics and behavior of lipids interacting with membrane proteins.",29366674,2018,Cardiolipin dynamics and binding to conserved residues in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.
1213,"Human behavior and cognition result from a complex pattern of interactions between brain regions. The flexible reconfiguration of these patterns enables behavioral adaptation, such as the acquisition of a new motor skill. Yet, the degree to which these reconfigurations depend on the brain's baseline sensorimotor integration is far from understood. Here, we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in sensorimotor networks at baseline were predictive of individual differences in future learning. We analyzed functional MRI data from 19 participants prior to six weeks of training on a new motor skill. We found that visual-motor connectivity was inversely related to learning rate: sensorimotor autonomy at baseline corresponded to faster learning in the future. Using three additional scans, we found that visual-motor connectivity at baseline is a relatively stable individual trait. These results suggest that individual differences in motor skill learning can be predicted from sensorimotor autonomy at baseline prior to task execution.",29366697,2018,Predicting future learning from baseline network architecture.
1214,"BACKGROUND
The cognitive-behavioral model of problematic Internet use (PIU) proposes that psychological well-being is associated with specific thoughts and behaviors on the Internet. Hence, there is growing concern that PIU is associated with psychological impairments.


OBJECTIVE
Given the proposal of gender schema theory and social role theory, men and women are predisposed to experience social anxiety and engage in Internet use differently. Thus, an investigation of gender differences in these areas is warranted. According to the cognitive-behavioral model of PIU, social anxiety is associated with specific cognitions and behaviors on the Internet. Thus, an investigation of the association between social anxiety and PIU is essential. In addition, research that takes into account the multidimensional nature of social anxiety and PIU is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore multivariate gender differences in and the relationships between social anxiety and PIU.


METHODS
Participants included 505 college students, of whom 241 (47.7%) were women and 264 (52.3%) were men. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 22 years, with a mean age of 20.34 (SD=1.16). The Social Anxiety Scale and Problematic Internet Use Scale were used in data collection. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and canonical correlation analysis were used.


RESULTS
Mean differences between men and women were not statistically significant in social anxiety (λ=.02, F3,501=2.47, P=.06). In all three PIU dimensions, men scored higher than women, and MANOVA shows that multivariate difference was statistically significant (λ=.94, F3,501=10.69, P<.001). Of the canonical correlation functions computed for men, only the first was significant (Rc=.43, λ=.78, χ29=64.7, P<.001) and accounted for 19% of the overlapping variance. Similarly, only the first canonical function was significant for women (Rc=.36, λ=.87, χ29=33.9, P<.001), which accounted for 13% of the overlapping variance.


CONCLUSIONS
On the basis of the findings, we conclude that enhanced educational opportunities for women and their increasing role in the society have led women to become more active and thus closed the gap in social anxiety levels between men and women. We found that men showed more difficulties than women in terms of running away from personal problems (ie, social benefit), used the Internet more excessively, and experienced more interpersonal problems with significant others due to Internet use. We conclude that men are under a greater risk of social impairments due to PIU. Our overall conclusion is that there is a substantial amount of association between social anxiety and PIU and the association is stronger for men than it is for women. We advise that future research continue to investigate PIU and social anxiety as multidimensional constructs.",29367182,2018,Gender Differences in and the Relationships Between Social Anxiety and Problematic Internet Use: Canonical Analysis.
1215,"Children who aggress against their peers may use physical or relational forms, yet little research has looked at early childhood risk factors and characteristics that uniquely predict high levels of relational versus physical aggression in preadolescence. Accordingly, the main aim of our study was to link early corporal punishment and externalizing behavior to children's physical and relational peer aggression during preadolescence and to examine how these pathways differed by sex. Participants were 193, 3-year-old boys (39%) and girls who were reassessed following the transition to kindergarten (5.5 years) and preadolescence (10.5 years). A series of autoregressive, cross-lagged path analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between child externalizing problems and corporal punishment at ages 3 and 5.5 years, and their association with physical and relational aggression at age 10.5. Multiple group analysis was used to determine whether pathways differed by sex. Three developmental pathways were identified: (i) direct associations between stable childhood externalizing problems and later physical aggression; (ii) a direct pathway from early corporal punishment to preadolescent relational and physical peer aggression; and (iii) an indirect pathway from early corporal punishment to later physical aggression via continuing externalizing problems in middle childhood. Child sex moderated the nature of these pathways, as well as the direction of association between risk and outcome variables. These data advance our understanding of the etiology of distinct forms of peer aggression and highlight the potential for more efficacious prevention and intervention efforts in the early childhood years.",29368346,2018,Early risk pathways to physical versus relational peer aggression: The interplay of externalizing behavior and corporal punishment varies by child sex.

Participation in research is associated with benefits and burdens for individual research participants. Children living with a chronic illness are considered particularly vulnerable as they are already burdened with symptoms of their illness. In particular contexts, such as learning health care systems (LHS), where research and clinical care are integrated, children with chronic illnesses may be asked to participate in research related to their illness. A growing body of literature has focused on children's perspectives as research subjects; however, a relatively understudied aspect concerns children's experiences of research in clinics where they are also patients.


METHODS
We interviewed 25 Canadian children and adolescents living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) about their experiences of research participation.


RESULTS
Our participants described aspects of the research process and particular experiences as benefits and others as burdens. Benefits included helping others, receiving incentives, receiving the results of previous studies, and participating in fun activities. Burdens included the time required for particular types of research, physical and psychological discomfort, and feelings of obligation.

1217,"The current study investigated behavioral and neuroimaging evidence for orthographic influences on auditory word identification. To assess such influences, the proportion of similar sounding words (i.e. phonological neighbors) that were also spelled similarly (i.e., orthographic neighbors) was computed for each auditorily presented word as the Orthographic-to-Phonological Overlap Ratio (OPOR). Speech intelligibility was manipulated by presenting monosyllabic words in multi-talker babble at two signal-to-noise ratios: + 3 and + 10 dB SNR. Identification rates were lower for high overlap words in the challenging + 3 dB SNR condition. In addition, BOLD contrast increased with OPOR at the more difficult SNR, and decreased with OPOR under more favorable SNR conditions. Both voxel-based and region of interest analyses demonstrated robust effects of OPOR in several cingulo-opercular regions. However, contrary to prior theoretical accounts, no task-related activity was observed in posterior regions associated with phonological or orthographic processing. We suggest that, when processing is difficult, orthographic-to-phonological feature overlap increases the availability of competing responses, which then requires additional support from domain general performance systems in order to produce a single response.",29371094,2018,Orthographic influence on spoken word identification: Behavioral and fMRI evidence.

However, not much is known about associations between beliefs about FDA tobacco regulatory authority and comparative harm perceptions of tobacco products. Data were analyzed from the Health Information National Trends Survey, HINTS-FDA 2015 (N = 3738), which is a cross-sectional, probability-based, nationally representative survey of U.S. non-institutionalized civilian adults aged 18 years or older. Weighted multinomial and logistic regression analyses regressed comparative harm perceptions on sociodemographic factors, beliefs about FDA regulatory authority, perceptions of FDA credibility, and beliefs about modifiability of cancer risk (behavioral cancer causal beliefs and cancer fatalism). Findings indicate that, compared to non-users, current tobacco users are more likely to report believing that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes, to report believing that some cigarette types may be less harmful than others, and to report believing that tobacco products are safer now than they were five years ago. Awareness of FDA regulatory authority was associated with reporting the belief that tobacco products are safer now than five years ago, that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes, and that some cigarette types are less harmful than other cigarette types.

The results suggested that trans-resveratrol at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (via gavage, i.g.) reversed TDS-induced decreases in the percentage of time spent in the center of arena, the open arm entries and time spent in the open arms in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. It also decreased the percentage of freezing time in the contextual fear paradigm that was increased in TDS treated rats. Further study suggested that TDS-induced abnormality in the limbic hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (L-HPA) axis was reversed by trans-resveratrol, i.e. it reversed increased adrenal gland index and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) levels, and rescued the differential expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and amygdala. Neurobiological studies suggested that trans-resveratrol increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, which were decreased in rats subjected to TDS. These results provide compelling evidence that trans-resveratrol protects neurons against PTSD-like stress insults by regulation of L-HPA axis function and activation of downstream neuroprotective molecules, such as pCREB and BDNF expression.",29373817,2018,trans-Resveratrol ameliorates anxiety-like behaviors and fear memory deficits in a rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder.
1221,"BACKGROUND
Chronic conditions in the United States are among the most costly and preventable of all health problems. Research suggests health coaching is an effective strategy for reducing health risks including decreases in weight, blood pressure, lipids, and blood glucose. Much less is known about how and when coaching works.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to conduct an analysis of intrapersonal variations in participants' progression in health coaching, examining gender and age-related differences.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of 35,333 health coaching participants between 2012 and 2016. Differences in number of goals and activities set and completed, and number of interactions were assessed using negative binomial models. Differences in goal type were assessed using logistic regression for gender and using the Welch test for age to account for unequal variances.


RESULTS
Participants choosing online coaching were more likely to be younger and female (P<.001). Gender and age differences were found for the types of goals set by participants. Regarding program activity, women set and completed 12% more action steps than men (P<.001), averaging 21% more interactions than men (P<.001); no gender differences were found in number of goals completed (P=.12), although the percentage of males and females completing goals was significantly different at 60 and 120 days postenrollment (P<.001). Results indicated significant age-related differences in all aspects of program activity: number of interactions, goals set and completed, action steps set and completed (all P values <.01), as well as significant differences in percentage of individuals completing initial goals within 30 days, with older individuals completing more than younger individuals did (all P values <.001).


CONCLUSIONS
This study found significant intrapersonal variation in how people participate in and progress through a coaching program. Age-related variations were found in all aspects of coaching activity, from modality preference and initial choice of goal type (eg, weight management, tobacco cessation) to goal completion, whereas gender-related differences were demonstrated for all program activities except number of goals set and completed. These findings indicate that to maximize behavior change, coaches need to personalize the coaching experience to the individual.",29374005,2018,Intrapersonal Variation in Goal Setting and Achievement in Health Coaching: Cross-Sectional Retrospective Analysis.
1222,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by severe motor deficits and reduced striatal dopamine levels. PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive flexibility impairments, e.g., probabilistic reversal learning deficits that limit daily living. However, less is known about how decreased striatal dopamine signaling affects cognitive flexibility. Past studies indicate that the rat dorsomedial striatum is a striatal subregion that supports cognitive flexibility. Because PD patients exhibit probabilistic reversal learning deficits, the present experiment investigated whether the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injected into the dorsomedial striatum of male Long-Evans rats affects the acquisition and/or reversal learning of a spatial discrimination using a probabilistic learning procedure (80/20). Behavioral testing was conducted in a cross maze that occurred across two consecutive days. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions were not impaired on acquisition, but were impaired in reversal learning compared to that of sham controls. In reversal learning, dorsomedial striatal dopamine depletion led to initial perseveration of the previously correct choice pattern, as well as an impairment in maintaining the new choice pattern after initially selected (regressive errors). A 6-OHDA lesion in the dorsomedial striatum also significantly increased 'lose-shift' probabilities in reversal learning suggesting that reduced dopamine signaling in this striatal area increased sensitivity to negative feedback ultimately impairing the maintenance of a new response pattern. Overall, the findings suggest that dopamine reduction in this striatal subregion can serve as a useful model to test novel treatments for ameliorating cognitive flexibility deficits in PD.",29374536,2018,Cognitive Flexibility Deficits Following 6-OHDA Lesions of the Rat Dorsomedial Striatum.
1223,"Among insects, Hymenoptera present a striking olfactory system with a clear neural dichotomy from the periphery to higher order centers, based on two main tracts of second-order (projection) neurons: the medial and lateral antennal lobe tracts (m-ALT and l-ALT). Despite substantial work on this dual pathway, its exact function is yet unclear. Here, we ask how attributes of odor quality and odor quantity are represented in the projection neurons (PNs) of the two pathways. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we compared the responses of m-ALT and l-ALT PNs of the honey bee Apis mellifera to a panel of 16 aliphatic odorants, and to three chosen odorants at eight concentrations. The results show that each pathway conveys differential information about odorants' chemical features or concentration to higher order centers. While the l-ALT primarily conveys information about odorants' chain length, the m-ALT informs about odorants' functional group. Furthermore, each tract can only predict chemical distances or bees' behavioral responses for odorants that differ according to its main feature, chain length or functional group. Generally l-ALT neurons displayed more graded dose-response relationships than m-ALT neurons, with a correspondingly smoother progression of inter-odor distances with increasing concentration. Comparison of these results with previous data recorded at AL input reveals differential processing by local networks within the two pathways. These results support the existence of parallel processing of odorant features in the insect brain.",29374539,2018,Differential Processing by Two Olfactory Subsystems in the Honeybee Brain.
1224,"In this work we described the rheological properties of polysaccharides (HBSS, CHSS, DASS, CASS) sequentially extracted from onion (Allium cepa L.). Four onion polysaccharides (ACLPs) solutions resulted into significant differences on their rheological properties. ACLPs solutions showed non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior over the range of 0.5-2.5%. At concentration of 1%, the apparent viscosity of CHSS was observed to be the highest. The apparent viscosity of ACLPs solutions decreased with the acidic pH (4.0) or alkaline pH (10.0) which was further declined at higher temperature (90 °C). After the addition of various salts, ACLPs had apparent differences on apparent viscosity. The G' (storage modulus) and G″ (loss modulus) of ACLP solutions were increased with increasing oscillation frequency. Moreover, the crossover value of oscillation frequency gradually decreased with increasing concentration of ACLPs. Our results exhibited that among the ACLPs, CHSS can be used as supplements in the food industry as thickening agent, gelling agent and stabilizer.",29374565,2018,Effects of extraction methods on the rheological properties of polysaccharides from onion (Allium cepa L.).
1225,"The results of the study of the mineral and vitamin composition of fruit and vegetable powders, as well as their influence on the clinical and physiological parameters in laboratory animals (body weight, behavior patterns, functional state of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, general clinical and biochemical parameters of blood) were obtained. The study was performed on white Wistar rats initial body weight 190±20 g that were previously kept in quarantine for 5 days. One control group and six experimental groups (6 animals in each) were formed. Within 28 days animals from experimental groups were administered the diet supplemented with fruit or vegetable powder (carrot, squash, beet, apples, cabbage, pumpkin) in an amount of 3% by weight of the feed. When carrot powder was consumed, amplification processes of catabolism of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, as evidenced by an increase in blood levels of bilirubin, activity of alkaline phosphatase, GGT, LDH and significant reduction of cholesterol and triglyceride level occurred. In animals that received zucchini powder, body weight increased by 15.6% compared to the initial, as well as the activation of the immune response, enhance of carbohydrate metabolism (urea level and AST activity decreased under normal blood level of total protein, albumin fraction, bilirubin, creatinine, and LDH and ALT activity) and fat metabolism (cholesterol and triglyceride level reducing) was observed. Consumption of beet powder caused an increase in the number of red blood cells and platelets, elevated protein and fat metabolism (decrease in albumin, bilirubin, creatinine and urea level at normal parameters of total protein, glucose, AST activity, marked decrease in the level of triglycerides and cholesterol), had a stimulating effect on the heart (blood pressure and pulse rate increased). Consumption of apple powder caused the activation of the immune response, improved blood formation, activated energy metabolism (decrease in creatinine, urea, albumin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides level, AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity), slowed heart rate and had a hypotensive effect. After uptake of cabbage powder, weight gain by 21.7% from the initial weight, increase in alkaline phosphatase and GTT activity, activation of protein metabolism (decrease in the number of total protein, albumin, bilirubin level) has been revealed. In the study of orienting-motor functions it was found that physical activity and «mink» reflex increased in this animals as well as swimming time before exhaustion raised by 27.1% compared to control animals. Body weight increased mostly pronounced (by 29.0% of the original) when pumpkin powder was consumed. Addition of pumkin powder contributed to the activation of blood immune system; protein metabolism increase (raise of total protein and urea, reduction in bilirubin level, AST activity); the duration of swimming to exhaustion increased by 37.9%, compared with the control group.

1226,"Efficient neural processing depends on regulating responses through suppression and facilitation of neural activity. Utilizing a well-known visual motion paradigm that evokes behavioral suppression and facilitation, and combining five different methodologies (behavioral psychophysics, computational modeling, functional MRI, pharmacology, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), we provide evidence that challenges commonly held assumptions about the neural processes underlying suppression and facilitation. We show that: (1) both suppression and facilitation can emerge from a single, computational principle - divisive normalization; there is no need to invoke separate neural mechanisms, (2) neural suppression and facilitation in the motion-selective area MT mirror perception, but strong suppression also occurs in earlier visual areas, and (3) suppression is not primarily driven by GABA-mediated inhibition. Thus, while commonly used spatial suppression paradigms may provide insight into neural response magnitudes in visual areas, they should not be used to infer neural inhibition.",29376822,2018,Suppression and facilitation of human neural responses.
1227,"The aim of the article is to study actual ration of patients suffered from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and its interaction with the development of arterial hypertension (AH). 296 men aged 20–59 suffered from HFRS were under the care of physician within the period of 1 to 6 years. Among this group 49 cases of arterial hypertension have been registered after HFRS. Frequency method of food product consumption was used to define nutrition. A Russian questionnaire published by Institute of Nutrition (1997) was used. Actual nutrition in men suffered from HFRS is marked by basic nutrients unbalance that is: excessive cholesterol and fat consumption (due to saturated fatty acid), polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency, sugar overuse and animal protein prevalence over vegetable proteins in patient ration. Atherogenic shift in a ration of patients with AH and suffered from HRFS has been exposed more strongly in all aged group but mostly evident in patients aged 40 and after. Alcohol consumption in men with AH and suffered from HFRS is higher than in healthy peers. Interaction between atherogenic unbalance on the main nutrients in patients with HFRS and arterial hypertension has been defined.

1228,"Ghrelin plays roles in a wide range of central functions by activating the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). This receptor has recently been found in the substantia nigra (SN) to control dopamine (DA)-related physiological functions. The dysregulation of DA neurons in the SN pars compacta (SNc) and the consequent depletion of striatal DA are known to underlie the motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we further investigated the role of the SN-ghrelin system in motor function under the stereotaxic injection of AAV-CMV-FLEX-diphtheria toxin A (DTA) into the SN of dopamine transporter (DAT)-Cre (DATSN::DTA) mice to expunge DA neurons of the SNc. First, we confirmed the dominant expression of GHSR1a, which is a functional GHSR, in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive DA neurons in the SNc of control mice. In DATSN::DTA mice, we clearly observed motor dysfunction using several behavioral tests. An immunohistochemical study revealed a dramatic loss of TH-positive DA neurons in the SNc and DAT-labeled axon terminals in the striatum, and an absence of mRNAs for TH and DAT in the SN of DATSN::DTA mice. The mRNA level of GHSR1a was drastically decreased in the SN of these mice. In normal mice, we also found the mRNA expression of GHSR1a within GABAergic neurons in the SN pars reticulata (SNr). Under these conditions, a single injection of ghrelin into the SN failed to improve the motor deficits caused by ablation of the nigrostriatal DA network using DATSN::DTA mice, whereas intra-SN injection of ghrelin suppressed the motor dysfunction caused by the administration of haloperidol, which is associated with the transient inhibition of DA transmission. These findings suggest that phasic activation of the SNc-ghrelin system could improve the dysregulation of nigrostriatal DA transmission related to the initial stage of PD, but not the motor deficits under the depletion of nigrostriatal DA. Although GHSRs are found in non-DA cells of the SNr, GHSRs on DA neurons in the SNc may play a crucial role in motor function.",29378186,2018,Effect of ghrelin on the motor deficit caused by the ablation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic cells or the inhibition of striatal dopamine receptors.
1229,"Synesthesia is associated with additional perceptual experiences, which are automatically and consistently triggered by specific inducing stimuli. Synesthesia is also accompanied by more general sensory and cortical changes, including enhanced modality-specific cortical excitability. Extensive cognitive training has been shown to generate synesthesia-like phenomenology but whether these experiences are accompanied by neurophysiological changes characteristic of synesthesia remains unknown. Addressing this question provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the neural basis of perceptual plasticity relevant to conscious experiences. Here we investigate whether extensive training of letter-color associations leads not only to synesthetic experiences, but also to changes in cortical excitability. We confirm that overtraining synesthetic associations results in synesthetic phenomenology. Stroop tasks further reveal synesthesia-like performance following training. Electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation show, respectively, enhanced visual evoked potentials (in response to untrained patterns) and lower phosphene thresholds, demonstrating specific cortical changes. An active (using letter-symbol training) and a passive control confirmed these results were due to letter-color training and not simply to repeated testing. Summarizing, we demonstrate specific cortical changes, following training-induced acquisition of synesthetic phenomenology that are characteristic of genuine synesthesia. Collectively, our data reveal dramatic plasticity in human visual perception, expressed through a coordinated set of behavioral, neurophysiological, and phenomenological changes.",29378205,2018,"Coordinated neural, behavioral, and phenomenological changes in perceptual plasticity through overtraining of synesthetic associations."
1230,"Maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) has been suggested to be associated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in both humans and animal models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is still unclear. We have recently reported that MSD at different stages of pregnancy impairs the emotional and cognitive functions, and suppresses hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring rats. Here, we report that the MSD induced LTP impairment at the CA1 hippocampus of the offspring rats is associated with increased long-term depression (LTD) and reduced expression of postsynaptic GluA2-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Importantly, we found that inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis by a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA23Y (3 μmol/kg, i.p.) not only increased level of AMPARs and reduced LTD, but also restored LTP. Moreover, treatment with Tat-GluA23Y peptide markedly alleviated the MSD-induced impairments of spatial learning and memory; and decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Together, our findings suggest that the MSD-induced postsynaptic AMPAR endocytosis causally contributes to the impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, thereby disrupting the emotional and cognitive functions in the offspring.",29378210,2018,Facilitated AMPAR endocytosis causally contributes to the maternal sleep deprivation-induced impairments of synaptic plasticity and cognition in the offspring rats.
1231,"Addiction is a chronic and highly relapsing disorder hypothesized to be produced by an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. For more than a decade, emerging evidence indicates that manipulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission, by group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4/7/8), could be a promising approach to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of addiction. Thus, the aim of the present study is to determine whether LSP2-9166, a mixed mGlu4/mGlu7 orthosteric agonist, could reduce ethanol self-administration, ethanol motivation and reacquisition after protracted abstinence in a preclinical model of excessive ethanol intake. Male Long Evans rats were chronically trained to consume large amount of ethanol in operant cages for several weeks. Once they reached a stable level of consumption (about 1 g of pure ethanol/kg bodyweight/15min), the effect of LSP2-9166 was evaluated on different aspects of the operant self-administration behavior. In this study, we found that the intracerebroventricular infusion of LSP2-9166 dose dependently reduced ethanol consumption, motivation for ethanol and reacquisition of ethanol self-administration after abstinence. Together, these results support recent preclinical findings showing that pharmacological modulation of mGlu receptors may serve as an effective treatment for reducing ethanol consumption and relapse.",29378211,2018,"Pharmacological activation of mGlu4 and mGlu7 receptors, by LSP2-9166, reduces ethanol consumption and relapse in rat."
1232,"The systemic administration of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) LPA1/3 receptor antagonists is a promising clinical tool for cancer, sclerosis and fibrosis-related diseases. Since LPA1 receptor-null mice engage in increased ethanol consumption, we evaluated the effects of systemic administration of an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist (intraperitoneal ki16425, 20 mg/kg) on ethanol-related behaviors as well as on brain and plasma correlates. Acute administration of ki16425 reduced motivation for ethanol but not for saccharine in ethanol self-administering Wistar rats. Mouse experiments were conducted in two different strains. In Swiss mice, ki16425 treatment reduced both ethanol-induced sedation (loss of righting reflex, LORR) and ethanol reward (escalation in ethanol consumption and ethanol-induced conditioned place preference, CPP). Furthermore, in the CPP-trained Swiss mice, ki16425 prevented the effects of ethanol on basal c-Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex and on adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In the c57BL6/J mouse strain, however, no effects of ki16425 on LORR or voluntary drinking were observed. The c57BL6/J mouse strain was then evaluated for ethanol withdrawal symptoms, which were attenuated when ethanol was preceded by ki16425 administration. In these animals, ki16425 modulated the expression of glutamate-related genes in brain limbic regions after ethanol exposure; and peripheral LPA signaling was dysregulated by either ki16425 or ethanol. Overall, these results suggest that LPA1/3 receptor antagonists might be a potential new class of drugs that are suitable for treating or preventing alcohol use disorders. A pharmacokinetic study revealed that systemic ki16425 showed poor brain penetration, suggesting the involvement of peripheral events to explain its effects.",29378212,2018,Systemic blockade of LPA1/3 lysophosphatidic acid receptors by ki16425 modulates the effects of ethanol on the brain and behavior.
1233,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compact (SNpc), with consequent depletion of dopamine in the striatum, which gives rise to the characteristic motor symptoms of PD. Although its etiology is unknown, several studies have suggested that oxidative stress plays a critical function in the pathophysiology of PD, and antioxidant agents could be helpful to slown down the dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Carvacrol (CA) is a phenolic monoterpene found in essential oils of many aromatic plants that presents antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to assess the effect of CA in a reserpine (RES)-induced rat model of PD. Male Wistar rats received 15 s.c. injections of 0.1 mg/kg RES or vehicle, every other day, concomitantly to daily i.p. injections of CA (12.5 or 25 mg/kg) or vehicle. Across the treatment, the animals were submitted to behavioral evaluation in the catalepsy test (performed daily), open field test (7th day) and assessment of vacuous chewing movements (12th, 20th and 30th days). Upon completion of behavioral tests, rats were perfused and their brains underwent tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemical analysis. Our results showed that CA (12.5 e 25 mg/kg) prevented the increase in catalepsy behavior and number of vacuous chewing movements, but failed to revert the decreased open-field locomotor activity induced by RES. In addition, CA in both doses prevented the decrease in TH immunostaining induced by RES in the SNpc and dorsal striatum. Taken together, our results suggest that CA shows a protective effect in a rat model of PD, preventing motor and neurochemical impairments induced by RES. Thus, the use of CA as a promising new strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of PD may be considered.",29378222,2018,Carvacrol prevents impairments in motor and neurochemical parameters in a model of progressive parkinsonism induced by reserpine.
1234,"OBJECTIVE
Adult picky eating (PE) has received increased attention in the eating behavior literature due to its important association with adult avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). The current study tested a model of potential risk factors of adult PE behavior, including perceived early parental feeding practices. An exploratory model was also utilized to understand associations with different aspects of adult PE behaviors.


METHODS
A sample of 1339 US adults recruited through Amazon's MTurk completed an online survey that included the recently developed Adult Picky Eating Questionnaire (APEQ), retrospective reports of parental feeding practices, and other measures of eating behavior and demographic variables. A structural equation modeling procedure tested a series of regression models that included BMI and disordered eating behaviors as covariates.


RESULTS
SEM modeling indicated that retrospective reports of greater parental pressure to eat, higher disgust sensitivity, lower PE age of onset, and experiencing an aversive food event were associated with general adult PE behavior. Results also indicated parental encouragement of healthy eating may be a protective factor, and that men endorsed higher levels of adult PE. Exploratory analyses indicated that cross-sectional predictors and covariates were differentially related to specific aspects of PE as measured by the APEQ subscales.

To address this question, we measured human brain activity before and after fear acquisition under conditions of 24 h sleep deprivation versus normal sleep using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Additionally, we explored whether the fear acquisition-induced change of brain activity during the fear memory consolidation window can be predicted by subjective fear ratings and autonomic fear response, assessed by skin conductance responses (SCR) during acquisition. Behaviorally, the SD group demonstrated increased subjective and autonomic fear responses compared to controls at the stage of fear acquisition. During the stage of fear consolidation, the SD group displayed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity and concomitantly increased amygdala activity. Moreover, in the SD group fear acquisition-induced brain activity changes in amygdala were positively correlated with both, subjective and autonomic fear indices during acquisition, whereas in controls changes vmPFC activity were positively correlated with fear indices during acquisition. Together, the present findings suggested that SD may weaken the top-down ability of the vmPFC to regulate amygdala activity during fear memory consolidation. Moreover, subjective and objective fear at fear acquisition stage can predict the change of brain activity in amygdala in fear memory consolidation following SD.",29378319,2018,Alter spontaneous activity in amygdala and vmPFC during fear consolidation following 24 h sleep deprivation.

For example, cross-modal sensory processing at the level of the occipital cortex appears to be associated with adaptive behaviors in the blind. However, detailed studies examining the structural properties of key white matter pathways in other regions of the brain remain limited. Given that blind individuals rely heavily on their sense of hearing, we examined the structural properties of two important pathways involved with auditory processing, namely the uncinate and arcuate fasciculi. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography was used to examine structural parameters (i.e., tract volume and quantitative anisotropy, or QA) of these two fasciculi in a sample of 13 early blind individuals and 14 normally sighted controls. Compared to controls, early blind individuals showed a significant increase in the volume of the left uncinate fasciculus.

AK-7 decreased the infarction volume remarkably and promoted the recovery of neurological function efficiently in the mice evaluated by behavior tests.

Yokukansan is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has been approved in Japan as a remedy for neurosis, insomnia, and irritability in children. It has also been reported to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with various forms of dementia.


AIM OF THE STUDY
To evaluate the usefulness of co-treatment with an antidepressant and an herbal medicine in the psychiatric field, the current study examined the effect of yokukansan on the anxiolytic-like effect of fluvoxamine in mice.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The anxiolytic-like effect in mice was estimated by the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Contextual fear conditioning consisted of two sessions, i.e., day 1 for the conditioning session and day 2 for the test session. The expression levels of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor in the mouse brain regions were quantified by western blot analysis.


RESULTS
A single administration of fluvoxamine (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) before the test session dose-dependently and significantly suppressed freezing behavior in mice. In the combination study, a sub-effective dose of fluvoxamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly suppressed freezing behavior in mice that had been repeatedly pretreated with yokukansan (0.3 and 1 g/kg, p.o.) once a day for 6 days after the conditioning session. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of 5-HT2A receptor was specifically decreased in the prefrontal cortex of mice that had been administered yokukansan and fluvoxamine. Furthermore, microinjection of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 nmol/mouse) into the prefrontal cortex significantly suppressed freezing behavior.


CONCLUSION
The present findings indicate that repeated treatment with yokukansan synergistically enhances the anxiolytic-like effect of fluvoxamine in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm in mice in conjunction with a decrease in 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, combination therapy with fluvoxamine and yokukansan may be beneficial for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",29382554,2018,"Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, enhances the anxiolytic effect of fluvoxamine and reduces cortical 5-HT2A receptor expression in mice."

Regular exercise has long been touted as a strategy for weight loss maintenance, but the lack of clear evidence in clinical trials has caused some to question its effectiveness. In this review, we present the arguments both questioning and in support of exercise as an obesity therapeutic. Our purpose is to bring clarity to the literature, present a unified perspective, and identify the gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in future studies. Critical questions remain including sex differences, individual variability and compensatory behaviors in response to exercise, exercise adherence, the role of energy flux and the molecular mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of exercise after weight loss and during weight regain. Future research should focus on these critical questions to provide a more complete understanding of the potential benefits of exercise on weight loss maintenance.",29382563,2018,Is regular exercise an effective strategy for weight loss maintenance?
1240,"BACKGROUND
Despite the near ubiquity of mobile phones, little research has been conducted on the implementation of mobile health (mHealth) apps to treat patients in primary care. Although primary care clinicians routinely treat chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes, they rarely treat addiction, a common chronic condition. Instead, addiction is most often treated in the US health care system, if it is treated at all, in a separate behavioral health system. mHealth could help integrate addiction treatment in primary care.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this paper was to report the effects of implementing an mHealth system for addiction in primary care on both patients and clinicians.


METHODS
In this implementation research trial, an evidence-based mHealth system named Seva was introduced sequentially over 36 months to a maximum of 100 patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) in each of three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs; primary care clinics that serve patients regardless of their ability to pay). This paper reports on patient and clinician outcomes organized according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.


RESULTS
The outcomes according to the RE-AIM framework are as follows: Reach-Seva reached 8.31% (268/3226) of appropriate patients. Reach was limited by our ability to pay for phones and data plans for a maximum of 100 patients per clinic. Effectiveness-Patients who were given Seva had significant improvements in their risky drinking days (44% reduction, (0.7-1.25)/1.25, P=.04), illicit drug-use days (34% reduction, (2.14-3.22)/3.22, P=.01), quality of life, human immunodeficiency virus screening rates, and number of hospitalizations. Through Seva, patients also provided peer support to one another in ways that are novel in primary care settings. Adoption-Patients sustained high levels of Seva use-between 53% and 60% of the patients at the 3 sites accessed Seva during the last week of the 12-month implementation period. Among clinicians, use of the technology was less robust than use by patients, with only a handful of clinicians using Seva in each clinic and behavioral health providers making most referrals to Seva in 2 of the 3 clinics. Implementation-At 2 sites, implementation plans were realized successfully; they were delayed in the third. Maintenance-Use of Seva dropped when grant funding stopped paying for the mobile phones and data plans. Two of the 3 clinics wanted to maintain the use of Seva, but they struggled to find funding to support this.


CONCLUSIONS
Implementing an mHealth system can improve care among primary care patients with SUDs, and patients using the system can support one another in their recovery. Among clinicians, however, implementation requires figuring out how information from the mHealth system will be used and making mHealth data available in the electronic health (eHealth) record. In addition, paying for an mHealth system remains a challenge.",29382624,2018,Implementing a Mobile Health System to Integrate the Treatment of Addiction Into Primary Care: A Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness Study.
1241,"Similar to many diurnal animals, Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a mid-day siesta that is more robust as temperature increases, an adaptive response that aims to minimize the deleterious effects from exposure to heat. This temperature-dependent plasticity in mid-day sleep levels is partly based on the thermal sensitive splicing of an intron in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the circadian clock gene termed period (per). In this study, we evaluated a possible role for the serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors in the regulation of dmpi8 splicing efficiency and mid-day siesta. Using a Drosophila cell culture assay we show that B52/SRp55 increases dmpi8 splicing efficiency, whereas other SR proteins have little to no effect. The magnitude of the stimulatory effect of B52 on dmpi8 splicing efficiency is modulated by natural variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the per 3' UTR that correlate with B52 binding levels. Down-regulating B52 expression in clock neurons increases mid-day siesta and reduces dmpi8 splicing efficiency. Our results establish a novel role for SR proteins in sleep and suggest that polymorphisms in the per 3' UTR contribute to natural variation in sleep behavior by modulating the binding efficiencies of SR proteins.",29382842,2018,The SR protein B52/SRp55 regulates splicing of the period thermosensitive intron and mid-day siesta in Drosophila.
1242,"Prenatal ethanol exposure is known to cause neurodevelopmental disorders. While high prevalence of epilepsy is observed among the children whose mothers abused alcohol during pregnancy, the results from animal studies are conflicting. Here, we investigated whether embryonic exposure to ethanol can increase the susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in larval zebrafish. Embryos at 3 hours post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to ethanol at the concentrations ranging from 0.25% to 1% for 21 hours. Control and ethanol-exposed larvae were challenged with PTZ at 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) at the concentrations of 2.5, 5 or 15 mM. The seizure behavior of larvae was recorded and analyzed using EthoVision XT 11. We found that embryonic ethanol exposure increased the percentage of larvae exhibiting typical stage II and III seizure and resulted in a significant reduction in stage I, II and III seizure latency in an ethanol concentration-dependent manner. Embryonic exposure to ethanol also significantly increased the severity of PTZ-induced seizures in larvae, as demonstrated by increased total distance traveled and the duration of mobility. This is the first demonstration that ethanol exposure during early embryonic stage can reduce the threshold for chemically induced seizures and increase the severity of seizure behavior in larval fish.",29382872,2018,Embryonic exposure to ethanol increases the susceptibility of larval zebrafish to chemically induced seizures.
1243,"Sensory-motor deficits associated with below-knee amputation impair reactions to external perturbations. As such, below-knee prosthesis users rely on proactive control strategies to maintain locomotor stability. However, there are trade-offs (metabolic, comfort, etc.) associated with proactive strategies. We hypothesize that because proactive control strategies are costly, prosthesis users and non-impaired participants will use a priori knowledge (timing, direction) of an impending lateral perturbation to make specific gait adaptations only when the timing of the perturbation is known and the adaptation can be temporally-limited. This hypothesis was partially supported. When the perturbation timing was predictable, only prosthesis users, and only on their impaired side, increased their lateral margin of stability during the steps immediately preceding the perturbation when perturbation direction was either unknown or known to be directed towards their impaired side. This strategy should reduce the likelihood of requiring a corrective step to maintain stability. However, neither group exhibited substantial proactive adaptations compared to baseline walking when perturbation timing was unpredictable, independent of perturbation direction knowledge. The absence of further proactive stabilization behaviors observed in prosthesis users in anticipation of a certain but temporally unpredictable perturbation may be partially responsible for impaired balance control.",29382889,2018,Proactive Locomotor Adjustments Are Specific to Perturbation Uncertainty in Below-Knee Prosthesis Users.
1244,"While the advantage of screening vast databases of molecules to cover greater molecular diversity is often mentioned, in reality, only a few studies have been published demonstrating inhibitor discovery by screening more than a million compounds for features that mimic a known three-dimensional (3D) ligand. Two factors contribute: the general difficulty of discovering potent inhibitors, and the lack of free, user-friendly software to incorporate project-specific knowledge and user hypotheses into 3D ligand-based screening. The Screenlamp modular toolkit presented here was developed with these needs in mind. We show Screenlamp's ability to screen more than 12 million commercially available molecules and identify potent in vivo inhibitors of a G protein-coupled bile acid receptor within the first year of a discovery project. This pheromone receptor governs sea lamprey reproductive behavior, and to our knowledge, this project is the first to establish the efficacy of computational screening in discovering lead compounds for aquatic invasive species control. Significant enhancement in activity came from selecting compounds based on one of the hypotheses: that matching two distal oxygen groups in the 3D structure of the pheromone is crucial for activity. Six of the 15 most active compounds met these criteria. A second hypothesis-that presence of an alkyl sulfate side chain results in high activity-identified another 6 compounds in the top 10, demonstrating the significant benefits of hypothesis-driven screening.",29383467,2018,Enabling the hypothesis-driven prioritization of ligand candidates in big databases: Screenlamp and its application to GPCR inhibitor discovery for invasive species control.
1245,"OBJECTIVE
This study examined specialty behavioral health treatment patterns among employer-insured adults in same- and different-gender domestic partnerships and marriages.


METHODS
The study used behavioral health service claims (2008-2013) from Optum to estimate gender-stratified penetration rates of behavioral health service use by couple type and partnership status among partnered adults ages 18-64 (N=12,727,292 person-years) and levels of use among those with any use (conditional analyses). Least-squares, logistic, and zero-truncated negative binomial regression analyses adjusted for age, employer and plan characteristics, and provider supply and for sociodemographic factors in sensitivity analyses. Generalized estimating equations were used to address within-group correlation of adults clustered in employer groups.


RESULTS
Both women and men in same-gender marriages or domestic partnerships had higher rates of behavioral health service use, particularly diagnostic evaluation, individual psychotherapy, and medication management, and those in treatment had, on average, more psychotherapy visits than those in different-gender marriages. Behavioral health treatment patterns were similar between women in same-gender domestic partnerships and same-gender marriages, but they diverged between men in same-gender domestic partnerships and same-gender marriages. Moderation analysis results indicated that adults with same-gender partners living in states with fewer legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons were less likely than adults with same-gender partners in LGBT-friendly states to receive behavioral health treatment. Sensitivity analyses did not affect findings.

1247,"While some studies have assessed patient recall of important information from ambulatory care visits, none has done so recently. Furthermore, little is known about features of clinical interactions which are associated with patient understanding and recall, without which shared decision making, a widely shared ideal for patient care, cannot occur. Our objective was to evaluate characteristics of patients and outpatient encounters associated with patient recall of information after one week, along with observation of elements of shared decision making. This was an observational study based on coded transcripts of 189 outpatient encounters, and post-visit interviews with patients 1 week later. Coding used three previously validated systems, adopted for this study. Forty-nine percent of decisions and recommendations were recalled accurately without prompting; 36% recalled with a prompt; 15% recalled erroneously or not at all. Provider behaviors hypothesized to be associated with patient recall, such as open-questioning and ""teach back,"" were rare. Patients with less than high school education recalled 38% of items freely and accurately, while patients with a college degree recalled 65% (p < .0001). In a multivariate model, the total number of items to be recalled per visit, and percentage of utterances in decision-making processes by the provider (""verbal dominance""), were significant predictors of poorer recall.

1248,"In optogenetics, rhodopsins were established as light-driven tools to manipulate neuronal activity. However, during long-term photostimulation using channelrhodopsin (ChR), desensitization can reduce effects. Furthermore, requirement for continuous presence of the chromophore all-trans retinal (ATR) in model systems lacking sufficient endogenous concentrations limits its applicability. We tested known, and engineered and characterized new variants of de- and hyperpolarizing rhodopsins in Caenorhabditis elegans. ChR2 variants combined previously described point mutations that may synergize to enable prolonged stimulation. Following brief light pulses ChR2(C128S;H134R) induced muscle activation for minutes or even for hours ('Quint': ChR2(C128S;L132C;H134R;D156A;T159C)), thus featuring longer open state lifetime than previously described variants. Furthermore, stability after ATR removal was increased compared to the step-function opsin ChR2(C128S). The double mutants C128S;H134R and H134R;D156C enabled increased effects during repetitive stimulation. We also tested new hyperpolarizers (ACR1, ACR2, ACR1(C102A), ZipACR). Particularly ACR1 and ACR2 showed strong effects in behavioral assays and very large currents with fast kinetics. In sum, we introduce highly light-sensitive optogenetic tools, bypassing previous shortcomings, and thus constituting new tools that feature high effectiveness and fast kinetics, allowing better repetitive stimulation or investigating prolonged neuronal activity states in C. elegans and, possibly, other systems.",29389997,2018,Rhodopsin optogenetic toolbox v2.0 for light-sensitive excitation and inhibition in Caenorhabditis elegans.
1249,"Physical activity behavior varies naturally from day to day, from week to week and even across seasons. In order to assess the habitual level of physical activity of a person, the person must be monitored for long enough so that the level can be identified, taking into account this natural within-person variation. An important question, and one whose answer has implications for study- and survey design, epidemiological research and population surveillance, is, for how long does an individual need to be monitored before such a habitual level or pattern can be identified to a desired level of precision? The aim of this study was to estimate the number of repeated observations needed to identify the habitual physical activity behaviour of an individual to a given degree of precision. A convenience sample of 50 Swedish adults wore accelerometers during four consecutive weeks. The number of days needed to come within 5-50% of an individual's usual physical activity 95% of the time was calculated. To get an idea of the uncertainty of the estimates all statistical estimates were bootstrapped 2000 times. The mean number of days of measurement needed for the observation to, with 95% confidence, be within 20% of the habitual physical activity of an individual is highest for vigorous physical activity, for which 182 days are needed. For sedentary behaviour the equivalent number of days is 2.4. To capture 80% of the sample to within ±20% of their habitual level of physical activity, 3.4 days is needed if sedentary behavior is the outcome of interest, and 34.8 days for MVPA. The present study shows that for analyses requiring accurate data at the individual level a longer measurement collection period than the traditional 7-day protocol should be used. In addition, the amount of MVPA was negatively associated with the number of days required to identify the habitual physical activity level indicating that the least active are also those whose habitual physical activity level is the most difficult to identify. These results could have important implications for researchers whose aim is to analyse data on an individual level. Before recommendations regarding an appropriate monitoring protocol are updated, the present study should be replicated in different populations.",29390010,2018,The number of repeated observations needed to estimate the habitual physical activity of an individual to a given level of precision.
1250,"BACKGROUND
Sjogren's syndrome is the leading cause for aqueous tear-deficiency dry eye. Little is known regarding the relationship between Sjogren's syndrome dry eye (SSDE) and patients' medical expenditure, clinical severity and psychological status changes.


METHODS
Thirty-four SSDE patients and thirty non-Sjogren's syndrome dry eye (non-SSDE) subjects were enrolled. They were required to complete three self-report questionnaires: Ocular Surface Disease Index, Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scales, and a questionnaire designed by the researchers to study the patients' treatment, medical expenditure and income. The correlations between expenditures and these parameters were analyzed.


RESULTS
The annual total expenditure on the treatment of SSDE was Chinese Yuan 7637.2 (approximately US$1173.8) on average, and the expense paid by SSDE patients themselves was Chinese Yuan 2627.8 (approximately US$403.9), which were 5.5 and 4.5 times higher than non-SSDE patients (both P < 0.001). The annual total expense on Chinese medicine and western medicine were 35.6 times and 78.4% higher in SSDE group than in non-SSDE group (both P < 0.001). Moreover, indirect costs associated with the treatment were 70.0% higher in SSDE group. In SSDE group, the score of Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scales had significantly positive correlation with total medical expenditure and the expense on Chinese medicine (ρ = 0.399 and ρ = 0.400,both P = 0.019). Nevertheless, total medical expenditure paid by the patients in non-SSDE group positively correlated with the score of Ocular Surface Disease Index (ρ = 0.386, P = 0.035).

1251,"Some of the neurobehavioral deficits identified in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) have been recapitulated in a binge model of gestational third trimester-equivalent ethanol (EtOH) exposure, in which Sprague-Dawley rats are intragastrically intubated between post-natal day (PD) 4 and PD9 with high doses of EtOH. In this model, the ameliorating effects of choline (Chol) administration on hippocampus-dependent behaviors altered by EtOH have also been extensively documented. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EtOH (5 g/kg/day) and/or Chol (100 mg/kg/day) on morphometric parameters of CA1 pyramidal neurons by Golgi-Cox staining followed by Neurolucida tracing and analysis. We found that EtOH increased apical dendrite complexity in male and female pups neonatally exposed to EtOH. EtOH did not significantly affect basal dendrite parameters in female and male rats. Interestingly, Chol treatments decreased basal dendrites' length, number, and maximal terminal distance in male pups. When pups were co-treated with EtOH and Chol, Chol did not rescue the effect of EtOH. In conclusion, EtOH increases while Chol decreases dendritic length and arborization of hippocampal CA1 neurons in PD9 rats. We hypothesize that developmental EtOH exposure induces a premature maturation of neurons, leading to early restriction of neuronal plasticity while Chol treatments delay the normal program of neuronal maturation and therefore prolong the window of maximal plasticity. Chol does not prevent the effects of developmental alcohol exposure on hippocampal pyramidal neurons' morphology characterized in the present study, although whether prolonged Chol administration after developmental EtOH exposure rectifies EtOH damage remains to be assessed.",29391132,2018,Neonatal Ethanol and Choline Treatments Alter the Morphology of Developing Rat Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons in Opposite Directions.

AWG consisted mainly from short chain fatty acids, 1,3 propanediol and residual glycerol, which were also evaluated individually as substrates. Accumulation capacity and yields were estimated after solvent extraction and purification and PHAs were further analyzed in terms of their chemical structure, thermal properties, molecular masses and mechanical properties. The lowest accumulation capacity was noticed for non-acidified waste glycerol as carbon source which led to the generation of P(3HB), whereas for the other carbon sources co-polymers of 3HB with 3HV or 3HHx were produced. Average molecular mass weights were quite high in all cases reaching ~1.8×106Da. The thermal properties and the mechanical behavior of PHAs were shown to be highly affected by their monomeric composition, whereas it was also concluded that DSC and DMA results were in good agreement.",29391227,2018,Comparison of yields and properties of microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates generated from waste glycerol based substrates.

A fluorescence probe technique revealed the formation of micellar structures on the hyaluronan in homogeneous systems well below the surfactant standard, critical, micellar concentration. Moreover, regions of gel-phase separation were revealed. A detailed phase diagram was, thus, constructed in the very diluted region and the hyaluronan concentration was found to be the main parameter controlling the phase behavior, in contrast to the charge ratio. The stability of hyaluronan-surfactant aggregates in the homogeneous systems while in storage at 4 °C (up to three months), against dilution, salt addition and on heating-cooling (between 10 and 50 °C) was also investigated. The aggregates were stable while in storage or upon increasing and decreasing the temperature. The dilution of hyaluronan-surfactant complexes or the addition of 0.15 M NaCl led to their disintegration. Finally, systems prepared in a 0.15 M NaCl solution showed that interactions are suppressed and no aggregation below the standard critical micellar concentration was observed.",29391230,2018,Interactions of hyaluronan with oppositely charged surfactants in very diluted solutions in water.
1254,"Adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to incentives and relatively weak cognitive control, which may contribute to risky behaviors. Studies of brain activity have generally identified greater activation of the ventral striatum to rewards and less activation of prefrontal regions during control tasks in adolescents compared to adults. Little is known, however, about age-related changes in the functional brain networks underlying incentive processing and cognitive control. This cross-sectional study characterized the effects of incentives on inhibitory control during an oculomotor task using whole-brain functional connectivity analyses. During an fMRI scan, one hundred forty typically developing individuals completed an incentivized antisaccade task consisting of incentive cue, preparation, and response phases. We found that task modulation of control networks increased gradually from childhood to adulthood, whereas a network including ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex displayed an adolescent-specific peak in response to the receipt of outcomes, consistent with dual-systems models. Notably, however, greater modulation of salience and motor networks during the preparation phase mediated age-related improvements in antisaccade accuracy, whereas adolescent enhancement of value-related circuitry did not. Relative to neutral cues, both reward and loss cues enhanced task-related connectivity of the salience network when preparing to inhibit a saccade. Altogether, our findings suggest that incentives facilitate inhibitory control by enhancing the salience of one's responses and that over development, the recruitment of functional networks involved in saliency and motor preparation supports better performance.",29391243,2018,Incentives facilitate developmental improvement in inhibitory control by modulating control-related networks.

Accumulative experimental evidence has suggested an important involvement of gut microbiota in the modulation of host's immunological and neurological functions. However, it is previously unknown whether enteric microbiota is implicated in the formation of alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety. Using a murine model of chronic alcoholism and withdrawal, we examined the impact of alcohol consumption on the possible alterations of gut microbiota as well as alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety and behavior changes. The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that alcohol consumption did not alter the abundance of bacteria, but markedly changed the composition of gut microbiota. Moreover, the transplantation of enteric microbes from alcohol-fed mice to normal healthy controls remarkably shaped the composition of gut bacteria, and elicited behavioral signs of alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we further confirmed that the expression of genes implicated in alcohol addiction, BDNF, CRHR1 and OPRM1, was also altered by transplantation of gut microbes from alcohol-exposed donors. Collectively, our findings suggested a possibility that the alterations of gut microbiota composition might contribute to the development of alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety, and reveal potentially new etiologies for treating alcohol addiction.",29391279,2018,Gut microbiota modulates alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety in mice.

1257,"The policy positions parties choose are central to both attracting voters and forming coalition governments. How then should parties choose positions to best represent voters? Laver and Sergenti show that in an agent-based model with boundedly rational actors a decision rule (Aggregator) that takes the mean policy position of its supporters is the best rule to achieve high congruence between voter preferences and party positions. But this result only pertains to representation by the legislature, not representation by the government. To evaluate this we add a coalition formation procedure with boundedly rational parties to the Laver and Sergenti model of party competition. We also add two new decision rules that are sensitive to government formation outcomes rather than voter positions. We develop two simulations: a single-rule one in which parties with the same rule compete and an evolutionary simulation in which parties with different rules compete. In these simulations we analyze party behavior under a large number of different parameters that describe real-world variance in political parties' motives and party system characteristics. Our most important conclusion is that Aggregators also produce the best match between government policy and voter preferences. Moreover, even though citizens often frown upon politicians' interest in the prestige and rents that come with winning political office (office pay-offs), we find that citizens actually receive better representation by the government if politicians are motivated by these office pay-offs in contrast to politicians with ideological motivations (policy pay-offs). Finally, we show that while more parties are linked to better political representation, how parties choose policy positions affects political representation as well. Overall, we conclude that to understand variation in the quality of political representation scholars should look beyond electoral systems and take into account variation in party behavior as well.",29394268,2018,Governator vs. Hunter and Aggregator: A simulation of party competition with vote-seeking and office-seeking rules.
1258,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
With the introduction of insomnia disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), greater emphasis has been placed on the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorder even in the presence of a coexisting mental disorder. The current study seeks to explore the clinical picture of insomnia in the context of psychiatric disorders commonly associated with sleep complaints by assessing the prevalence and correlates of DSM-5 insomnia disorder, and examining the extent to which insomnia symptoms have been addressed in this population.


METHODS
Four hundred treatment-seeking outpatients suffering from depressive, bipolar affective, anxiety, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited. DSM-5 insomnia was established using the modified Brief Insomnia Questionnaire. Differences in sociodemographic factors, clinical status, impairment outcomes, and mental health services utilization were compared. Information on patients' help-seeking experiences for insomnia-related symptoms was collected to determine the treatment received and treatment effectiveness.


RESULTS
Almost one-third of our sample (31.8%) had DSM-5 insomnia disorder. Those with insomnia disorder had significantly higher impairment outcomes than their counterparts but no group difference was observed for mental health services utilization. Findings based on past treatment contact for sleep problems suggest that diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is lacking in this population.


CONCLUSIONS
With the new calling from DSM-5, clinicians treating psychiatric patients should view insomnia less as a symptom of their mental illnesses and treat clinical insomnia as a primary disorder. Patients should also be educated on the importance of reporting and treating their sleep complaints. Nonmedical (cognitive and behavioral) interventions for insomnia need to be further explored given their proven clinical effectiveness.",29394962,2018,Evaluating DSM-5 Insomnia Disorder and the Treatment of Sleep Problems in a Psychiatric Population.
1259,"BACKGROUND
The primary objectives of HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) phase 1 preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials are to assess safety and immune response to study products. Participant alcohol and drug use may affect adherence, retention, and risk of HIV infection. Data on the effects of substance use are limited to medical care compliance and treatment adherence in HIV infected participants. To our knowledge, there are no data assessing substance use and retention in these vaccine trials.


METHODS
We performed a meta-analysis on substance use and its impact on retention in HVTN phase I trials that recruited participants demonstrating lower risk profiles for HIV infection. Our analysis included data from 10 HVTN phase 1 clinical trials conducted between February 2009 and September 2014 in the Americas and Switzerland that utilized the identical interviewer-administered behavioral risk assessment questionnaire to capture participant self-report of substance use in the previous six months. Chi Square tests were used to assess statistical differences between variables.


RESULTS
Among the 964 participants, 170 (18%) missed a clinic visit and 78 (8%) terminated early from clinic follow-up; 75/774 (10%) on studies with multiple vaccination timepoints did not complete their vaccinations. Neither frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana, nor other drug use reported at screening visits were associated with the three adherence/retention measures. Binge drinking was associated with higher rates of unprotected sex while drunk (p < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
Light to moderate alcohol use does not negatively impact adherence or retention in phase I clinical trials. Based on these screening data and the low infection rate of participants during the trial period, the screening process for participation in HVTN phase 1 trials has largely been successful in enrolling and retaining individuals with lower risk profiles. Focusing on binge drinking and increased HIV/STI risk during risk reduction counseling may be warranted.",29395528,2018,"Substance use patterns of HVTN phase I clinical trial participants: Enrollment, risk reduction counseling and retention."
1260,"Ligaments provide stability to the human knee joint and play an essential role in restraining motion during daily activities. Compression-tension nonlinearity is a well-known characteristic of ligaments. Moreover, simpler material representations without this feature might give reasonable results because ligaments are primarily in tension during loading. However, the biomechanical role of different constitutive representations and their fibril-reinforced poroelastic properties is unknown. A numerical knee model which considers geometric and material nonlinearities of meniscus and cartilages was applied. Five different constitutive models for the ligaments (spring, elastic, hyperelastic, porohyperelastic, and fibril-reinforced porohyperelastic (FRPHE)) were implemented. Knee joint forces for the models with elastic, hyperelastic and porohyperelastic properties showed similar behavior throughout the stance, while the model with FRPHE properties exhibited lower joint forces during the last 50% of the stance phase. The model with ligaments as springs produced the lowest joint forces at this same stance phase. The results also showed that the fibril network contributed substantially to the knee joint forces, while the nonfibrillar matrix and fluid had small effects. Our results indicate that simpler material models of ligaments with similar properties in compression and tension can be used when the loading is directed primarily along the ligament axis in tension.",29396466,2018,The effect of constitutive representations and structural constituents of ligaments on knee joint mechanics.

However, participants in Experiment 2 who received risks information, norms information, or both reported greater SSB reduction intentions than did those who received no information.

However, there is no medication for most forms of chronic itch, although antihistamines are often used for anti-itch treatment. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major green tea polyphenol, exhibits anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Our previous studies highlighted a key role of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines in acute and chronic itch. Here, we evaluated the effects of green tea polyphenon 60 and EGCG on acute and chronic itch in mouse models and explored its potential mechanisms. The effects of EGCG were determined by behavioral tests in mouse models of acute and chronic itch, which were induced by compound 48/80, chloroquine (CQ), and 5% imiquimod cream treatment, respectively. We found that systemic or local administration of green tea polyphenon 60 or EGCG significantly alleviated compound 48/80- and chloroquine-induced acute itch in a dose-dependent manner in mice. Incubation of EGCG significantly decreased the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly induced by compound 48/80 and CQ in cultured ND7-23 cells, a dorsal root ganglia derived cell line. EGCG also attenuated imiquimod-induced chronic psoriatic itch behaviors and skin epidermal hyperplasia in mice. In addition, EGCG inhibited the expression of IL-23 mRNA in skin and TRPV1 mRNA in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Finally, EGCG remarkably inhibited compound 48/80-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and imiquimod-induced p-AKT in the spinal cord of mice, respectively. Collectively, these results indicated EGCG could be a promising strategy for anti-itch therapy.",29402411,2018,"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate attenuates acute and chronic psoriatic itch in mice: Involvement of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and suppression of ERK and Akt signaling pathways."
1263,"BACKGROUND
Methamphetamine (MA) abuse causes immune dysfunction and neuropsychiatric impairment. The mechanisms underlying these deficits remain unidentified.


METHODS
The effects of MA on anxiety-like behavior and immune function were investigated in mice selectively bred to voluntarily consume high amounts of MA [i.e., MA high drinking (MAHDR) mice]. MA (or saline) was administered to mice using a chronic (14-day), binge-like model. Performance in the elevated zero maze (EZM) was determined 5 days after the last MA dose to examine anxiety-like behavior. Cytokine and chemokine expressions were measured in the hippocampus using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Human studies were also conducted to evaluate symptoms of anxiety using the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale in adults with and without a history of MA dependence. Plasma samples collected from human research participants were used for confirmatory analysis of murine qPCR results using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.


RESULTS
During early remission from MA, MAHDR mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior on the EZM and reduced expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (ccl3) in the hippocampus relative to saline-treated mice. Human adults actively dependent on MA and those in early remission had elevated symptoms of anxiety as well as reductions in plasma levels of CCL3, relative to adults with no history of MA abuse.


CONCLUSIONS
The results highlight the complex effects of MA on immune and behavioral function and suggest that alterations in CCL3 signaling may contribute to the mood impairments observed during remission from MA addiction.",29402784,2018,Parallel Effects of Methamphetamine on Anxiety and CCL3 in Humans and a Genetic Mouse Model of High Methamphetamine Intake.
1264,"BACKGROUND AND AIM
A systematically developed and evaluated instrument is needed to support investigations of physiotherapists' clinical reasoning integrated with the process of clients' behavior change. This study's aim was to develop an instrument to assess physiotherapy students' and physiotherapists' clinical reasoning focused on clients' activity-related behavior and behavior change, and initiate its evaluation, including feasibility and content validity.


METHODS
The study was conducted in three phases: 1) determination of instrument structure and item generation, based on a model, guidelines for assessing clinical reasoning, and existing measures; 2) cognitive interviews with five physiotherapy students to evaluate item understanding and feasibility; and 3) a Delphi process with 18 experts to evaluate content relevance.


RESULTS
Phase 1 resulted in an instrument with four domains: Physiotherapist; Input from client; Functional behavioral analysis; and Strategies for behavior change. The instrument consists of case scenarios followed by items in which key features are identified, prioritized, or interpreted. Phase 2 resulted in revisions of problems and approval of feasibility. Phase 3 demonstrated high level of consensus regarding the instrument's content relevance.

This feasible and content-validated instrument shows potential for use in investigations of physiotherapy students' and physiotherapists' clinical reasoning, however continued development and testing are needed.",29405848,2018,Development and initial evaluation of an instrument to assess physiotherapists' clinical reasoning focused on clients' behavior change.
1265,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in the environment and has high reactivity. Once engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are released into natural systems, interactions of DOM with ENPs may significantly affect the fate and transport of ENPs, as well as the bioavailability and toxicity of ENPs to organisms. However, because of the complexity of DOM and the shortage of useful characterization methods, large knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the interactions between DOM and ENPs. In this article, we systematically reviewed the interactions between DOM and ENPs, discussed the effects of DOM on the environmental behavior of ENPs, and described the changes in bioavailability and toxicity of ENPs caused by DOM. Critical evaluations of published references suggest further need for assessing and predicting the influences of DOM on the transport, transformation, bioavailability, and toxicity of ENPs in the environment.",29406103,2018,Interactions between engineered nanoparticles and dissolved organic matter: A review on mechanisms and environmental effects.
1266,"Coagulation plays an important role in alleviating membrane fouling, and a noticeable problem is the development of microorganisms after long-time operation, which gradually secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). To date, few studies have paid attention to the behavior of microorganisms in drinking water treatment with ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. Herein, the membrane biofouling was investigated with different aluminum and iron salts. We found that Al2(SO4)3·18H2O performed better in reducing membrane fouling due to the slower growth rate of microorganisms. In comparison to Al2(SO4)3·18H2O, more EPS were induced with Fe2(SO4)3·xH2O, both in the membrane tank and the sludge on the cake layer. We also found that bacteria were the major microorganisms, of which the concentration was much higher than those of fungi and archaea. Further analyses showed that Proteobacteria was dominant in bacterial communities, which caused severe membrane fouling by forming a biofilm, especially for Fe2(SO4)3·xH2O. Additionally, the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were relatively higher in the presence of Al2(SO4)3·18H2O, resulting in less severe biofouling by effectively degrading the protein and polysaccharide in EPS. As a result, in terms of microorganism behaviors, Al-based salts should be given preference as coagulants during actual operations.",29406122,2018,Comparison of the effects of aluminum and iron(III) salts on ultrafiltration membrane biofouling in drinking water treatment.
1267,"Environmental factors during early life stages affect behavioral and physiological phenotypes in adulthood. We examined the effect of photoperiods during development on neurogenesis and affective behaviors during adolescence/adulthood using C57BL/6J mice. Mice were born and raised until weaning under long-day conditions (LDs) or short-day conditions (SDs), followed by a 12L12D cycle until adulthood. Adult mice born under SD showed a shorter latency to first immobility in the forced swim test when compared with the mice born under LD. The mice born under SD also exhibited significantly lower prepulse inhibition, which is a characteristic of schizophrenia. However, the mice exposed to SD and LD during the prenatal period only did not show differences in prepulse inhibition. At 4 weeks of age, there were less 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of mice born under SD when compared with mice born under LD. Double immunostaining showed that the mice born under SD showed less BrdU/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocyte marker) cells when compared with mice born under LD. Furthermore, expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the DG was higher in mice born under SD, and the photoperiod-dependent changes in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the DG were abolished by administration of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the photoperiod in early life alters astrogenesis in the hippocampus via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and may relate to affective behaviors in adulthood.",29406270,2018,"Early-life Photoperiod Influences Depression-like Behavior, Prepulse Inhibition of the Acoustic Startle Response, and Hippocampal Astrogenesis in Mice."
1268,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) formed by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) enhances the activity of Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels, contributing to the bladder pain accompanying hemorrhagic cystitis caused by systemic administration of cyclophosphamide (CPA) in mice. Given clinical and fundamental evidence for the involvement of the substance P/NK1 receptor systems in bladder pain syndrome (BPS)/interstitial cystitis (IC), we created an intravesical substance P-induced bladder pain model in mice and analyzed the possible involvement of the CSE/Cav3.2 pathway. Bladder pain/cystitis was induced by i.p. CPA or intravesical substance P in female mice. Bladder pain was evaluated by counting nociceptive behavior and by detecting referred hyperalgesia in the lower abdomen and hindpaw. The isolated bladder tissue was weighed to estimate bladder swelling and subjected to histological observation and Western blotting. Intravesical substance P caused profound referred hyperalgesia accompanied by little bladder swelling or edema 6-24 h after the administration, in contrast to i.p. CPA-induced nociceptive behavior/referred hyperalgesia with remarkable bladder swelling/edema and urothelial damage. The bladder pain and/or cystitis symptoms caused by substance P or CPA were prevented by the NK1 receptor antagonist. CSE in the bladder was upregulated by substance P or CPA, and the NK1 antagonist prevented the CPA-induced CSE upregulation. A CSE inhibitor, a T-type Ca2+ channel blocker and gene silencing of Cav3.2 abolished the intravesical substance P-induced referred hyperalgesia. The intravesical substance P-induced pain in mice is useful as a model for nonulcerative BPS, and involves the activation of the NK1 receptor/CSE/H2S/Cav3.2 cascade.",29407215,2018,"Involvement of the cystathionine-γ-lyase/Cav3.2 pathway in substance P-induced bladder pain in the mouse, a model for nonulcerative bladder pain syndrome."

Boundary condition equations for implementing stress-free boundaries (necessary for simulation of NDE scenarios) are also presented. Quantitative comparisons between LFD guided wave ultrasound simulation results, experimental guided wave data, and dispersion curves are described. Additionally, stability tests are performed to establish the LFD code behavior in the presence of stress-free boundaries and low-symmetry anisotropy. Results show that LFD is an appropriate approach for simulating ultrasound in anisotropic composite materials and that the method is stable in the presence of low-symmetry anisotropy and stress-free boundaries.

1270,"Although prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) social behavior is well-characterized in adults, surprisingly little is known about the development of social behavior in voles. Further, the overwhelming majority of studies in prairie voles examine social behavior in a reproductive context. Here, we examine developmental plasticity in affiliation and aggression and their underlying neural correlates. Using sexually naïve males, we characterized interactions with an age-matched, novel, same-sex conspecific in four different age groups that span pre-weaning to adulthood. We found that prosocial behavior decreased and aggression increased as males matured. Additionally, pre-weaning males were more prosocial than nonsocial, whereas post-weaning males were more nonsocial than prosocial. We also examined nonapeptide neural activity in response to a novel conspecific in brain regions important for promoting sociality and aggression using the immediate early gene cFos. Assessment of developmental changes in neural activity showed that vasopressin neurons in the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis exhibit functional plasticity, providing a potential functional mechanism that contributes to this change in sociality as prairie voles mature. This behavioral shift corresponds to the transition from a period of allopatric cohabitation with siblings to a period of time when voles disperse and presumably attempt to establish and defend territories. Taken together our data provide a putative mechanism by which brain and behavior prepare for the opportunity to pairbond (characterized by selective affiliation with a partner and aggression toward unfamiliar conspecifics) by undergoing changes away from general affiliation and toward selective aggression, accounting for this important life history event.",29407458,2018,Mechanistic substrates of a life history transition in male prairie voles: Developmental plasticity in affiliation and aggression corresponds to nonapeptide neuronal function.
1271,"INTRODUCTION
Pica behavior, kaolin ingestion, in rats and mice can be used as an assessment of nausea and vomiting; however, we observed that the incidence of pica behavior in ICR strain mice varied markedly. We investigated the susceptibility of four strains of mice (ICR, BALB/c, C57BL/6, and DBA/2) to the development of pica behavior.


METHODS
Mice received cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) with or without a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (granisetron: 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) or tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist (fosaprepitant: 30 mg/kg, i.p.), and then their daily kaolin intake was measured for 2 days. We examined the expression of preprotachykinin (PPT)-A mRNA in the medulla of cisplatin-treated mice 8 and 32 h after drug administration.


RESULTS
All mice except for ICR strain significantly increased kaolin intake after cisplatin administration. Among the tested strains, DBA/2 mice compared to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice notably showed pica behavior on both days (P < 0.0001). The expression of PPT-A mRNA was significantly increased 8 h after cisplatin administration in all strains, but the increase remained on the second day only in DBA/2 mice (P < 0.05). Granisetron significantly inhibited pica behavior in DBA/2 mice on the first day (P < 0.0001), but not the second day; however, fosaprepitant completely inhibited the pica behavior on both days (P < 0.001).


DISCUSSION
These results indicate that cisplatin-induced pica behavior in mice is likely to be influenced by the genotype, and that DBA/2 mice are useful to analyze the emetogenic or anti-emetic potential of drugs in preclinical studies.",29407728,2018,Strain differences in the development of cisplatin-induced pica behavior in mice.
1272,"In this study we evaluated the effect of frutalin (FTL) on mouse behavior. Mice (n=6/group) were treated (i.p.) with FTL (0.25; 0.5 or 1mg/kg) or vehicle and submitted to several tests (hole-board/HBT, elevated plus maze/PMT, open field/OFT, tail suspension/TST, or forced swimming/FST). Yohimbine, ketamine, l-NAME, aminoguanidine, 7-NI, methylene blue, l-arginine or dl-serine was administered 30min before FTL (0.5mg/kg). To evaluate the subchronic effect, animals were injected with FTL or vehicle for 7days and submitted to the FST. Molecular docking was simulated using FTL against NOS and the NMDA receptor. No changes were observed in the HBT or the OFT. FTL (0.25mg/kg) increased the number of entries into enclosed arms in the PMT. FTL reduced immobility in the TST (0.25 and 0.5mg/kg) and the FST (0.25mg/kg; 0.5mg/kg). The effect of FTL was dependent on carbohydrate interaction and protein structure integrity and was reduced by ketamine, l-NAME, aminoguanidine, 7-NI and methylene blue, but not by l-arginine, yohimbine or dl-serine. The antidepressant-like effect remained after subchronic treatment. The molecular docking study revealed a strong interaction between FTL and NOS and NMDA. FTL was found to have an antidepressant-like effect mediated by the NMDA receptor/NO/cGMP pathway.",29408007,2018,Neuropharmacological characterization of frutalin in mice: Evidence of an antidepressant-like effect mediated by the NMDA receptor/NO/cGMP pathway.
1273,"Arsenic awareness plays a vital role in ensuring the sustainability of arsenic mitigation technologies. Thus far, however, few studies have dealt with the sustainability of such technologies and its associated socioeconomic dimensions. As a result, arsenic awareness prediction has not yet been fully conceptualized. Accordingly, this study evaluated arsenic awareness among arsenic-affected communities in rural India, using a structured questionnaire to record socioeconomic, demographic, and other sociobehavioral factors with an eye to assessing their association with and influence on arsenic awareness. First a logistic regression model was applied and its results compared with those produced by six state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine [SVM], Kernel-SVM, Decision Tree [DT], k-Nearest Neighbor [k-NN], Naïve Bayes [NB], and Random Forests [RF]) as measured by their accuracy at predicting arsenic awareness. Most (63%) of the surveyed population was found to be arsenic-aware. Significant arsenic awareness predictors were divided into three types: (1) socioeconomic factors: caste, education level, and occupation; (2) water and sanitation behavior factors: number of family members involved in water collection, distance traveled and time spent for water collection, places for defecation, and materials used for handwashing after defecation; and (3) social capital and trust factors: presence of anganwadi and people's trust in other community members, NGOs, and private agencies. Moreover, individuals' having higher social network positively contributed to arsenic awareness in the communities. Results indicated that both the SVM and the RF algorithms outperformed at overall prediction of arsenic awareness-a nonlinear classification problem. Lower-caste, less educated, and unemployed members of the population were found to be the most vulnerable, requiring immediate arsenic mitigation. To this end, local social institutions and NGOs could play a crucial role in arsenic awareness and outreach programs. Use of SVM or RF or a combination of the two, together with use of a larger sample size, could enhance the accuracy of arsenic awareness prediction.",29408061,2018,Developing robust arsenic awareness prediction models using machine learning algorithms.

1275,"Clinical and preclinical findings suggest that individuals with abnormal responses to reward cues (stimuli associated with reward) may be at risk for maladaptive behaviors including obesity, addiction and depression. Our objective was to develop a new paradigm for producing appetitive conditioning using primary (food) rewards in humans, and investigate the equivalency of several outcomes previously used to measure appetitive responses to conditioned cues. We used an individualized food reward, and multimodal subjective, psychophysiological and behavioral measures of appetitive responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS) that predicted delivery of that food. We tested convergence among these measures of appetitive response, and relationships between these measures and action impulsivity, a putative correlate of appetitive conditioning. 90 healthy young adults participated. Although the paradigm produced robust appetitive conditioning in some measures, particularly psychophysiological ones, there were not strong correlations among measures of appetitive responses to the CS, as would be expected if they indexed a single underlying process. In addition, there was only one measure that related to impulsivity. These results provide important information for translational researchers interested in appetitive conditioning, suggesting that various measures of appetitive conditioning cannot be treated interchangeably.",29408238,2018,Measuring appetitive conditioned responses in humans.
1276,"Pups have greater incentive value than males for rats during the postpartum estrus (PPE); a period when females are both maternally and sexually motivated. Mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been proposed as a general motivational circuit; however in the literature it has been more related to the control of the motivational aspects of maternal than sexual motivation of females. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of antagonizing dopaminergic neurotransmission of PPE females on their preference for pups over a male. To achieve this objective we tested PPE rats in a Y-maze with three-choice chambers (one containing eight pups, the other a male and the last one no stimulus) after the systemic administration of the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol (0.0; 0.025 or 0.05 mg/kg). Furthermore, to determine if this dopaminergic antagonist differentially affects maternal and sexual motivations when pups and male are not competing, we evaluated the effect of haloperidol in the preference of females for pups vs. a non-receptive female and for a male vs. a non-receptive female. In the preference test for pups vs. male, both doses of haloperidol decreased the time that females spent in pups' chamber while increased the time that they spent in male's chamber, resulting in a lack of preference between both incentives. Besides, haloperidol reduced the effort -attempts to get access to the stimuli- made by the females to obtain the pups. Conversely, 0.05 mg/kg of haloperidol did not affect the preference for both incentives when they were confronted to a non-receptive female. Together, these results indicate that the dopaminergic activity mediates pups' preference over male during the PPE and point toward a more relevant role of this system in females' behavioral output when incentives are competing.",29408305,2018,Dopaminergic activity mediates pups' over male preference of postpartum estrous rats.

1278,"Hypoxia as one of the principal properties of tumor cells is a reaction to the deprivation of oxygen. The location of tumor cells could be identified by assessment of oxygen and nutrient level in human body. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-known non-invasive method that is able to measure hypoxia based on the FMISO (Fluoromisonidazole) tracer dynamic. This paper aims to study the PET tracer concentration through convection-diffusion-reaction equations in a real human capillary-like network. A non-uniform oxygen pressure along the capillary path and convection mechanism for FMISO transport are taken into account to accurately model the characteristics of the tracer. To this end, a multi-scale model consists of laminar blood flow through the capillary network, interstitial pressure, oxygen pressure, FMISO diffusion and FMISO convection transport in the extravascular region is developed. The present model considers both normal and tumor tissue regions in computational domain. The accuracy of numerical model is verified with the experimental results available in the literature. The convection and diffusion types of transport mechanism are employed in order to calculate the concentration of FMISO in the normal and tumor sub-domain. The influences of intravascular oxygen pressure, FMISO transport mechanisms, capillary density and different types of tissue on the FMISO concentration have been investigated. According to result (Table 4) the convection mechanism of FMISO molecules transportation is negligible, but it causes more accuracy of the proposed model. The approach of present study can be employed in order to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as tumor shape, on the dynamic behavior of different PET tracers, such as FDG, can be extended to different case study problems, such as drug delivery.",29408401,2018,Modeling of FMISO [F18] nanoparticle PET tracer in normal-cancerous tissue based on real clinical image.

According to the results, Maasai judge food wasting as more immoral compared to Yali and Poles. What's more, Yali judge food wasting harsher than Poles.

1280,"In this study, a novel polysaccharide (PCPs) was obtained from bamboo shoots (Chimonobambusa quadrangularis) processing by-products through the ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) and Sephadex G-100 size-exclusion chromatography purification. By using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) to optimize the parameters for extracting the crude PCPs with UAE, the maximum yield of crude PCPs (8.76%) was obtained under the optimal extraction conditions as follows: ratio of water to raw material 20.2mL/g, extraction temperature 49°C, ultrasonic power 240W, and extraction time 40min. Structurally, PCPs was identified as hetero-polysaccharides, which was composed of Man, Rha, GlcA, GalA, Glc, Gal, Xyl, and Ara in a molecular ratio of 1.00:2.05:2.28:2.36:15.76:49.06:16.70:39.86. The molecular weight distribution analysis showed that PCPs had three components with molecular weights of 136.1, 29.7 and 8.3kD, respectively.

1281,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a poorly understood symptom affecting many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite growing evidence of a behavioral link between anxiety, attention and FOG in PD, no research to date has investigated the neural mechanisms that might explain this relationship. The present study therefore examined resting-state MRI functional connectivity between the amygdala, striatum and frontoparietal attentional control network in PD patients with (freezers: n = 19) and without FOG (non-freezers: n = 21) in the dopaminergic 'off' state. Functional connectivity was subsequently correlated with an objective measure of FOG severity and a subjective scale of affective disorder within each group. Connectivity between the right amygdala and right putamen was significantly increased in freezers compared to non-freezers (p < 0.01). Furthermore, freezers showed increased anti-coupling between the frontoparietal network and left amygdala (p = 0.011), but reduced anti-coupling between this network and the right putamen (p = 0.027) as compared to non-freezers. Key functional connections between the amygdala, putamen and frontoparietal network were significantly associated with FOG severity and a fear of falling. This study provides the first evidence that dysfunctional fronto-striato-limbic processes may underpin the link between anxiety and FOG in PD. It is proposed that freezers have heightened striato-limbic load and reduced top-down attentional control at rest, which when further challenged by the parallel processing demands of walking may precipitate FOG.",29408498,2018,Dysfunctional Limbic Circuitry Underlying Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease.

The SA/HEC/HA composites were synthesized using the lyophilization technique and further cross-linked in the presence of calcium ions to form composite hydrogel networks. The physicochemical, thermal behavior and morphology properties of the prepared scaffolds were characterized through XRD, DSC/TGA, FTIR and SEM. Furthermore, the mechanical behavior of the under investigated scaffolds was determined using texture analyzer. The in vitro bioactivity in SBF and adsorption of bovine serum albumin as well as cell viability for all the prepared scaffolds were also tested. The results indicated that the higher HA concentration (40wt%) enhanced the mechanical properties (23.9MPa), bioactivity and protein adsorption. Cell viability of the tested scaffolds confirmed the non-toxicity of the fabricated systems on the human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Proliferation capability was also confirmed for the tested scaffolds after 3 and 7days, but the higher HA-containing scaffold showed increased cell populations specially after 7days compared to HA-free scaffolds.

1283,"Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are essential techniques for studying distributed signal dynamics in the human brain. In particular, the functional role of neural oscillations remains to be clarified. For that reason, imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.",29408902,2018,Imaging of neural oscillations with embedded inferential and group prevalence statistics.
1284,"Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs)are one of the most recently developed chemotherapeutics to treat some types of tumor cells. They consist of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), linkers, and potent cytotoxic drugs. Unlike common chemotherapies, ADCs combine selectively with a target at the surface of the tumor cell, and a potent cytotoxic drug (payload) effectively prevents microtubule polymerization. In this work, we construct an ADC model that considers both the target of antibodies and the receptor (tubulin) of the cytotoxic payloads. The model is simulated with brentuximab vedotin, one of ADCs, and used to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ADCs in vivo. It also predicts area under the curve (AUC) of ADCs and the payloads by identifying the half-life. The results show that dynamical behaviors fairly coincide with the observed data and half-life and capture AUC. Thus, the model can be used for estimating some parameters, fitting experimental observations, predicting AUC, and exploring various dynamical behaviors of the target and the receptor.",29409861,2018,Mathematical modeling of antibody drug conjugates with the target and tubulin dynamics to predict AUC.
1285,"Errors in human behavior elicit a cascade of brain activity related to performance monitoring and error detection. Whereas the early error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) has been assumed to reflect a fast mismatch or prediction error signal in the medial frontal cortex, the later error positivity (Pe) is viewed as a correlate of conscious error processing. A still open question is whether these components represent two independent systems of error monitoring that rely on different types of information to detect an error. Here, we investigated the prediction that the Ne/ERN but not the Pe requires a representation of the correct response to emerge. To this end, we created a condition in which no information about the correct response was available while error detection was still possible. We hypothesized that a Pe, but no Ne/ERN should be obtained in this case. Participants had to classify targets but ignore flankers that were always associated with an incorrect response. Targets but not flankers were masked with varying target-masking intervals. Crucially, on some trials no target at all was presented, thus preventing the representation of a correct response and the emergence of an Ne/ERN. However, because flankers were easily visible and responses to the flankers were always incorrect, detection of these flanker errors was still possible. In line with predictions of a multiple-systems account, we observed a robust Pe in the absence of an Ne/ERN for these errors. Moreover, this Pe relied on the same neural activity as that on trials with a visible target, as revealed by multivariate pattern analysis. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms reflected by the two components use different types of information to detect errors, providing evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.",29409999,2018,Errors can elicit an error positivity in the absence of an error negativity: Evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.
1286,"The goal of childhood obesity lifestyle interventions are to positively change body composition, however it is unknown if interventions also modulate factors that are related to energy intake. This study aimed to examine changes in eating behaviors and plasma leptin concentrations in overweight and obese children participating in a 1-year family-centered lifestyle intervention. Interventions were based on Canadian diet and physical activity (PA) guidelines. Children were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: Control (Ctrl; no intervention), Standard treatment (StnTx: 2 servings milk and alternatives/day (d), 3x/wk weight-bearing PA), or Modified treatment (ModTx: 4 servings milk and alternatives/day; daily weight-bearing PA). Study visits occurred every 3-months for 1-y; interventions were held once a month for 6-months with one follow-up visit at 8-months. Ctrl received counselling after 1-y. Caregivers completed the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) and reported on diet and activity. Plasma leptin were measured from morning fasted blood samples. Seventy-eight children (mean age 7.8 ± 0.8 y; mean BMI 24.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated; 94% completed the study. Compared to baseline, at 6-months StnTx reduced Emotional Overeating and Desire to Drink scores (p < 0.05) while Food Responsiveness scores were reduced in both StnTx and ModTx (p < 0.05). At 1-year, scores for Desire to Drink in StnTx remained reduced compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Plasma leptin concentrations were significantly lower in ModTx at 6-months compared to baseline (p < 0.05). This study resulted in intervention groups favorably changing eating behaviors, supporting the use family-centered lifestyle interventions using Canadian diet and PA recommendations for children with obesity.",29410008,2018,Changes in eating behavior and plasma leptin in children with obesity participating in a family-centered lifestyle intervention.
1287,"Based on cue reactivity theory, food cues embedded in media content can lead to physiological and psychological responses in children. Research suggests that unhealthy food cues are represented more extensively and interactively in children's media environments than healthy ones. However, it is not clear to this date whether children react differently to unhealthy compared to healthy food cues. In an experimental study with 56 children (55.4% girls; Mage = 8.00, SD = 1.58), we used eye-tracking to determine children's attention to unhealthy and healthy food cues embedded in a narrative cartoon movie. Besides varying the food type (i.e., healthy vs. unhealthy), we also manipulated the integration levels of food cues with characters (i.e., level of food integration; no interaction vs. handling vs. consumption), and we assessed children's individual susceptibility factors by measuring the impact of their hunger level. Our results indicated that unhealthy food cues attract children's visual attention to a larger extent than healthy cues. However, their initial visual interest did not differ between unhealthy and healthy food cues. Furthermore, an increase in the level of food integration led to an increase in visual attention. Our findings showed no moderating impact of hunger. We conclude that especially unhealthy food cues with an interactive connection trigger cue reactivity in children.",29410047,2018,A treat for the eyes.

1288,"The permeabilization of biological membranes by electric fields, known as electroporation, has been traditionally performed with square electric pulses. These signals distribute the energy applied to cells in a wide frequency band. This paper investigates the use of sine waves, which are narrow band signals, to provoke electropermeabilization and the frequency dependence of this phenomenon. Single bursts of sine waves at different frequencies in the range from 8 kHz-130 kHz were applied to cells in vitro. Electroporation was studied in the plasma membrane and the internal organelles membrane using calcium as a permeabilization marker. Additionally, a double-shell electrical model was simulated to give a theoretical framework to our results. The electroporation efficiency shows a low pass filter frequency dependence for both the plasma membrane and the internal organelles membrane. The mismatch between the theoretical response and the observed behavior for the internal organelles membrane is explained by a two-step permeabilization process: first the permeabilization of the external membrane and afterwards that of the internal membranes. The simulations in the model confirm this two-step hypothesis when a variable plasma membrane conductivity is considered in the analysis. This study demonstrates how the use of narrow-band signals as sine waves is a suitable method to perform electroporation in a controlled manner. We suggest that the use of this type of signals could bring a simplification in the investigations of the very complex phenomenon of electroporation, thus representing an interesting option in future fundamental studies.",29410049,2018,Sine wave electropermeabilization reveals the frequency-dependent response of the biological membranes.
1289,"We tested the hypothesis that thermal behavior during the exercise recovery compensates for elevated core temperatures despite autonomic thermoeffector withdrawal. In a thermoneutral environment, 6 females and 6 males (22 ± 1 y) cycled for 60 min (225 ± 46 W metabolic heat production), followed by 60 min passive recovery. Mean skin and core temperatures, skin blood flow, and local sweat rate were measured continually. Subjects controlled the temperature of their dorsal neck to perceived thermal comfort using a custom-made neck device. Neck device temperature provided an index of thermal behavior. Mean body temperature, calculated as the average of mean skin and core temperatures, provided an index of the stimulus for thermal behavior. To isolate the independent effect of exercise on thermal behavior during recovery, data were analyzed post-exercise the exact minute mean body temperature recovered to pre-exercise levels within a subject. Mean body temperature returned to pre-exercise levels 28 ± 20 min into recovery (Pre: 33.5 ± 0.2, Post: 33.5 ± 0.2 °C, P = 0.20), at which point, mean skin temperature had recovered (Pre: 29.6 ± 0.4, Post: 29.5 ± 0.5 °C, P = 0.20) and core temperature (Pre: 37.3 ± 0.2, Post: 37.5 ± 0.3 °C, P = 0.01) remained elevated.

1290,"Anxiety is one of the most common mental states of humans. Although it drives us to avoid frightening situations and to achieve our goals, it may also impose significant suffering and burden if it becomes extreme. Because we experience anxiety in a variety of forms, previous studies investigated neural substrates of anxiety in a variety of ways. These studies revealed that individuals with high state, trait, or pathological anxiety showed altered neural substrates. However, no studies have directly investigated whether the different dimensions of anxiety share a common neural substrate, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we investigated a brain network of anxiety shared by different dimensions of anxiety in a unified analytical framework using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed different datasets in a single scale, which was defined by an anxiety-related brain network derived from whole brain. We first conducted the anxiety provocation task with healthy participants who tended to feel anxiety related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in their daily life. We found a common state anxiety brain network across participants (1585 trials obtained from 10 participants). Then, using the resting-state fMRI in combination with the participants' behavioral trait anxiety scale scores (879 participants from the Human Connectome Project), we demonstrated that trait anxiety shared the same brain network as state anxiety. Furthermore, the brain network between common to state and trait anxiety could detect patients with OCD, which is characterized by pathological anxiety-driven behaviors (174 participants from multi-site datasets). Our findings provide direct evidence that different dimensions of anxiety have a substantial biological inter-relationship. Our results also provide a biologically defined dimension of anxiety, which may promote further investigation of various human characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, from the perspective of anxiety.",29410078,2018,"A common brain network among state, trait, and pathological anxiety from whole-brain functional connectivity."
1291,"Cognitive control of attention in conflict situations is a basic skill that is vital for goal-oriented behavior. Behavioral evidence shows that conflict control occurs over successive trials as well as longer time scales of trial blocks, but the relation among time scales as well as their neural mechanisms are unclear. This study used measures of behavior, EEG, and a simple quantitative model to test the hypothesis that conflict control at the block level is not exclusively driven by control adjustments over successive trials. Young adults performed an auditory Simon task, and the base rate of compatible vs. incompatible trials was manipulated in separate blocks (25, 50, 75% compatible). EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to define cortical mechanisms of any base rate and trial-by-trial sequence effects. Reaction time measures had both sequence and base rate effects. Two fronto-medial ICA components indexed sequence and base rate effects, with specific profiles for evoked potentials and oscillations in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Predictive modeling showed that sequence effects accounted for a minority of the variance on behavioral and ICA measures (all < 36%). The results strongly suggest that the base rate manipulation affected behavior and many neural measures beyond the influence of sequence effects.",29410123,2018,Cognitive control and midline theta adjust across multiple timescales.
1292,"Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. However, how dopamine modulates the large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners, we investigated the effect of levodopa (l-dopa) on two aspects of cortical dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the functional connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in l-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, l-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. On the connectome level, however, l-dopa diminished functional integration across temporal and cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity in more than two thirds of the participants and to different degrees. Hypo-integration co-occurred with relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as posterior putamen. Both, l-dopa-induced BOLD signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individual's l-dopa-induced benefits in behavioral performance, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, l-dopa-induced modulations of BOLD signal variability were correlated with l-dopa-induced modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency. Our findings underline the role of dopamine in maintaining the dynamic range of, and communication between, cortical systems, and their explanatory power for inter-individual differences in benefits from dopamine during cognitive performance.",29410219,2018,Dopaminergic modulation of hemodynamic signal variability and the functional connectome during cognitive performance.
1293,"The regulation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) behaviors has been mainly studied through exploration of biochemical factors. However, the current directed differentiation protocols for hPSCs that completely rely on biochemical factors remain suboptimal. It has recently become evident that coexisting biophysical signals in the stem cell microenvironment, including nanotopographic cues, can provide potent regulatory signals to mediate adult stem cell behaviors, including self-renewal and differentiation. Herein, we utilized a recently developed, large-scale nanofabrication technique based on reactive-ion etching (RIE) to generate random nanoscale structures on glass surfaces with high precision and reproducibility. We report here that hPSCs are sensitive to nanotopographic cues and such nanotopographic sensitivity can be leveraged for improving directed neuronal differentiation of hPSCs. We demonstrate early neuroepithelial conversion and motor neuron (MN) progenitor differentiation of hPSCs can be promoted using nanoengineered topographic substrates. We further explore how hPSCs sense the substrate nanotopography and relay this biophysical signal through a regulatory signaling network involving cell adhesion, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and Hippo/YAP signaling to mediate the neuroepithelial induction of hPSCs. Our study provides an efficient method for large-scale production of MNs from hPSCs, useful for regenerative medicine and cell-based therapies.",29410983,2018,Nanotopography regulates motor neuron differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.
1294,"This article focuses on the division of labor between evolution and development in solving sequential, state-dependent decision problems. Currently, behavioral ecologists tend to use dynamic programming methods to study such problems. These methods are successful at predicting animal behavior in a variety of contexts. However, they depend on a distinct set of assumptions. Here, we argue that behavioral ecology will benefit from drawing more than it currently does on a complementary collection of tools, called reinforcement learning methods. These methods allow for the study of behavior in highly complex environments, which conventional dynamic programming methods do not feasibly address. In addition, reinforcement learning methods are well-suited to studying how biological mechanisms solve developmental and learning problems. For instance, we can use them to study simple rules that perform well in complex environments. Or to investigate under what conditions natural selection favors fixed, non-plastic traits (which do not vary across individuals), cue-driven-switch plasticity (innate instructions for adaptive behavioral development based on experience), or developmental selection (the incremental acquisition of adaptive behavior based on experience). If natural selection favors developmental selection, which includes learning from environmental feedback, we can also make predictions about the design of reward systems. Our paper is written in an accessible manner and for a broad audience, though we believe some novel insights can be drawn from our discussion. We hope our paper will help advance the emerging bridge connecting the fields of behavioral ecology and reinforcement learning.",29412143,2018,Enriching behavioral ecology with reinforcement learning methods.
1295,"Exposure to early-life adversity may program brain function to prepare individuals for adaptation to matching environmental contexts. In this study we tested this hypothesis in more detail by examining the effects of early-life stress - induced by raising offspring with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9 - in various behavioral tasks and on synaptic function in adult mice. Early-life stress impaired adult performance in the hippocampal dependent low-arousing object-in-context recognition memory task. This effect was absent when animals were exposed to a single stressor before training. Early-life stress did not alter high-arousing context and auditory fear conditioning. Early-life stress-induced behavioral modifications were not associated with alterations in the dendritic architecture of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons or principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala. However, early-life stress reduced the ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and glutamate release probability specifically in hippocampal CA1 neurons, but not in the basolateral amygdala. These ex vivo effects in the hippocampus were abolished by acute glucocorticoid treatment. Our findings support that early-life stress can hamper object-in-context learning via pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms that affect hippocampal function but these effects are counteracted by acute stress or elevated glucocorticoid levels.",29412144,2018,Early life stress determines the effects of glucocorticoids and stress on hippocampal function: Electrophysiological and behavioral evidence respectively.

The thermodynamic survey of the fundamental backgrounds of concentration dependence and experimental solubility results show some peculiar behavior of aqueous solutions with several types of similar solutes. Secondly, the use of a variety of experimental spectroscopic devices, operating under different experimental conditions of dimension and frequency, has produced a large amount of structural and dynamic data on aqueous solutions showing the richness of the information produced, depending on where and how the experiment is carried out.

1297,"Development and maintenance of chronic pain is associated with structural and functional brain reorganization. However, few studies have explored the impact of drug treatments on such changes. The extent to which long-term analgesia is related to brain adaptations and its effects on the reversibility of brain reorganization remain unclear. In a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, we contrasted pain relief (3-month treatment period), and anatomical (gray matter density [GMD], assessed by voxel-based morphometry) and functional connectivity (resting state fMRI nodal degree count [DC]) adaptations, in 39 knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients (22 females), randomized to duloxetine (DLX, 60 mg once daily) or placebo. Pain relief was equivalent between treatment types. However, distinct circuitry (GMD and DC) could explain pain relief in each group: up to 85% of variance for placebo analgesia and 49% of variance for DLX analgesia. No behavioral measures (collected at entry into the study) could independently explain observed analgesia. Identified circuitry were outside of nociceptive circuitry and minimally overlapped with OA-abnormal or placebo response predictive brain regions. Mediation analysis revealed that changes in GMD and DC can influence each other across remote brain regions to explain observed analgesia. Therefore, we can conclude that distinct brain mechanisms underlie DLX and placebo analgesia in OA. The results demonstrate that even in the absence of differences in subjective pain relief, pharmacological treatments can be differentiated from placebo based on objective brain biomarkers. This is a crucial step to untangling mechanisms and advancing personalized therapy approaches for chronic pain.",29417694,2018,Inferring distinct mechanisms in the absence of subjective differences: Placebo and centrally acting analgesic underlie unique brain adaptations.
1298,"Abrupt discontinuation of chronic amphetamine consumption leads to withdrawal symptoms including depression, anhedonia, dysphoria, fatigue, and anxiety. These irritating symptoms may result in continuing to take the drug or can lead to suicidal behavior. Past studies have shown the involvement of various biologic systems in depression induced following amphetamine withdrawal (AW). However, there is no evidence about the relation between nitric oxide (NO) with NMDA receptors on depression following AW. In this study, we examined the involvement of the NO/NMDA pathways on depressive-like behaviors after 24 h withdrawal following 5 continuous days of amphetamine administration in male NMRI mice. Behavioral tasks used for depression assessment included the forced swimming test (FST), the Splash test and the open field test (OFT). In order to evaluate the role of NO/NMDA pathways animals treated with MK-801 (NMDA-R antagonist), Aminoguanidine (AG), a selective iNOS inhibitor, Nω-Nitro-l-arginine (L-NNA), a non-selective NOS inhibitor and 7-Nitro indazole (7-NI), a selective nNOS inhibitor. We also measured the level of nitrite in the hippocampus. Our data showed that AW induced the depressive-like effect in the FST and the Splash test. We showed that administration of AG, L-NNA, and MK-801 mitigated AW induced depression, however, 7-NI was failed to decrease depressive-like behaviors. Also, the antidepressant-like effect of co-injection of sub-effective doses of MK-801 with AG suggested that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is associated with NMDA-R in AW induced depression. In conclusion, both NO and NMDA-R pathways are involved and related to each other in depression induced following AW.",29421244,2018,Involvement of NO/NMDA-R pathway in the behavioral despair induced by amphetamine withdrawal.
1299,"The tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA) is a recently identified structure that exerts a major inhibitory drive onto midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. Also referred to as the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), the tVTA is a cluster of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons that starts within the posterior end of the VTA, where it is restricted dorsolateral to the caudal part of the interpeduncular nucleus, and extends into the pons. First identified in the rat, the tVTA has been described in many species, including mice and monkeys, as a region exhibiting similar anatomical and behavioral properties; it receives strong excitatory inputs from the lateral habenula (LHb), conveys negative reward-related information, and inhibits midbrain DA neuron activity. As an important inhibitory afferent to midbrain DA neurons, the tVTA is also implicated in drug abuse and in the complex interplay between reward and aversion processes.

1300,"BACKGROUND
Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) show deficits in working memory (WM) performance accompanied by bilateral fronto-parietal BOLD signal changes. It is unclear whether patients with a first depressive episode (FDE) exhibit the same signal changes as patients with recurrent depressive episodes (RDE).


METHODS
We investigated seventy-four MDD inpatients (48 RDE, 26 FDE) and 74 healthy control (HC) subjects performing an n-back WM task (0-back, 2-back, 3-back condition) in a 3T-fMRI.


RESULTS
FMRI analyses revealed deviating BOLD signal in MDD in the thalamus (0-back vs. 2-back), the angular gyrus (0-back vs. 3-back), and the superior frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back). Further effects were observed between RDE vs. FDE. Thus, RDE displayed differing neural activation in the middle frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back), the inferior frontal gyrus, and the precentral gyrus (0-back vs. 2-back). In addition, both HC and FDE indicated a linear activation trend depending on task complexity.


CONCLUSIONS
Although we failed to find behavioral differences between the groups, results suggest differing BOLD signal in fronto-parietal brain regions in MDD vs. HC, and in RDE vs. FDE. Moreover, both HC and FDE show similar trends in activation shapes. This indicates a link between levels of complexity-dependent activation in fronto-parietal brain regions and the stage of MDD. We therefore assume that load-dependent BOLD signal during WM is impaired in MDD, and that it is particularly affected in RDE. We also suspect neurobiological compensatory mechanisms of the reported brain regions in (working) memory functioning.",29421266,2018,Neural correlates of working memory in first episode and recurrent depression: An fMRI study.
1301,"Proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H fMRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique capable of detecting dynamic changes in glutamate related to task-related demands at a temporal resolution under 1 min. Several recent 1H fMRS studies demonstrated elevated steady-state levels of glutamate of 2% or greater during different 'task-active' conditions, relative to a 'non-task-active' control condition. However, the 'control' condition from these studies does vary with respect to the degree of constraining behavior, which may lead to different glutamate levels or variability between 'control' conditions. The purpose of this 1H fMRS study was to compare the steady-state levels and variability of glutamate in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of 16 healthy adults across four different putative 'non-task-active' conditions: relaxed with eyes closed, passive visual fixation crosshair, visual flashing checkerboard, and finger tapping. Results showed significantly lower glutamate levels during the passive visual fixation crosshair than the visual flashing checkerboard and the finger tapping conditions. Moreover, glutamate was significantly less variable during the passive visual fixation crosshair and the visual flashing checkerboard than the relaxed eyes closed condition. Of the four conditions, the passive visual fixation crosshair condition demonstrated the lowest and least variable glutamate levels potentially reflecting the least dlPFC engagement, but greatest behavioral constraint. These results emphasize the importance of selecting a proper 'control' condition to reflect accurately a 'non-task-active' steady-state level of glutamate with minimal variability during 1H MRS investigations.",29421322,2018,Differences in steady-state glutamate levels and variability between 'non-task-active' conditions: Evidence from 1H fMRS of the prefrontal cortex.

Allostatic load was defined by 10 biomarkers indicating the cumulative physiologic burden of stress. Depressive disorder was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression examined whether current smoking, excessive/binge drinking, insufficient physical activitiy, and fair/poor diet modified relationships between allostatic load and depressive disorder.

1303,"During extended observation of estrogen receptor (ER) α-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus, we previously identified a novel nucleus, the Sagittalis Nucleus of the Hypothalamus (SGN), in the interstitial area between the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The SGN exhibits sexual dimorphism in its volume and cell count, and estrous cycle related variations in ERα-immunoreactivity. These characteristics of the SGN implicate the nucleus in sex-biased brain functions and behaviors. In this study, we examined involvement of the SGN in sexual arousal in female rats. Immunohistochemical staining of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity was performed after administration of an estrus-inducing dose of estrogen and progesterone in ovariectomized female rats. Analysis of microscopic images showed a significant increase in the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the SGN following hormonal manipulation. Moreover, neuronal activity in the region exhibited a further increase after each animal was coupled with a male and allowed to mate.

1304,"BACKGROUND
Crack-cocaine is an important public health problem in Brazil and worldwide. It is a potent form of cocaine which results in rapid and damaging stimulating effects on the central nervous system through inhibition of the dopamine transporter. Some studies have suggested that both food and drugs - including crack, can act on the same brain reward mechanisms, altering the dopamine pathways that modulate behavioral responses. Our hypothesis was that leptin, a well-known peptide that modulates energy metabolism and appetite, can be used as a biomarker for drug use.


METHODS
Anthropometric data, drug use profiles, and leptin serum levels were evaluated in a cross-sectional study of 40 crack-cocaine users.


RESULTS
Leptin showed an inverse correlation with the severity of crack use, and this correlation remained when corrected by body mass index (BMI) and body composition by bioimpedance (BIA). The majority of subjects were eutrophic or overweight/obese considering BMI and BIA, and these variables were not significantly associated with the severity of crack use, but positively correlated with leptin levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Our preliminary findings suggest that leptin could be involved in drug use severity, perhaps through pathways similar to those whereby it modulates food intake. Considering the anthropometric parameters, these findings provide additional evidence that low weight is not predominant in crack users.",29421542,2018,Leptin levels and its correlation with crack-cocaine use severity: A preliminary study.
1305,"Intracortical microelectrode arrays, especially the Utah array, remain the most common choice for obtaining high dimensional recordings of spiking neural activity for brain computer interface and basic neuroscience research. Despite the widespread use and established design, mechanical, material and biological challenges persist that contribute to a steady decline in recording performance (as evidenced by both diminished signal amplitude and recorded cell population over time) or outright array failure. Device implantation injury causes acute cell death and activation of inflammatory microglia and astrocytes that leads to a chronic neurodegeneration and inflammatory glial aggregation around the electrode shanks and often times fibrous tissue growth above the pia along the bed of the array within the meninges. This multifaceted deleterious cascade can result in substantial variability in performance even under the same experimental conditions. We track both impedance signatures and electrophysiological performance of 4 × 4 floating microelectrode Utah arrays implanted in the primary monocular visual cortex (V1m) of Long-Evans rats over a 12-week period. We employ a repeatable visual stimulation method to compare signal-to-noise ratio as well as single- and multi-unit yield from weekly recordings. To explain signal variability with biological response, we compare arrays categorized as either Type 1, partial fibrous encapsulation, or Type 2, complete fibrous encapsulation and demonstrate performance and impedance signatures unique to encapsulation type.

In sub-Saharan Africa, where ~ 25 million individuals are infected with HIV and transmission is predominantly heterosexual, there is substantial geographic variation in the severity of epidemics.

We test our hypothesis by conducting a geospatial analysis of data from Malawi, where ~ 13% of women and ~ 8% of men are infected with HIV.


METHODS
We used georeferenced HIV testing and behavioral data from ~ 14,000 participants of a nationally representative population-level survey: the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS). We constructed gender-stratified epidemic surface prevalence (ESP) maps by spatially smoothing and interpolating the HIV testing data. We used the behavioral data to construct gender-stratified risk maps that reveal geographic variation in the size of the HRG. We tested our hypothesis by fitting gender-stratified spatial error regression (SER) models to the MDHS data.


RESULTS
The ESP maps show considerable geographic variation in prevalence: 1-29% (women), 1-20% (men). Risk maps reveal substantial geographic variation in the size of the HRG: 0-40% (women), 16-58% (men). Prevalence and the size of the HRG are highest in urban centers. However, the majority of HIV-infected individuals (~75% of women, ~ 80% of men) live in rural areas, as does most of the HRG (~ 80% of women, ~ 85% of men). We identify a significant (P < 0.001) geospatial relationship linking the size of the HRG with prevalence: the greater the size, the higher the prevalence. SER models show HIV prevalence in women is expected to exceed the national average in districts where > 20% of women are in the HRG. Most importantly, the SER models show that geographic variation in the size of the HRG can explain a substantial proportion (73% for women, 67% for men) of the geographic variation in epidemic severity.


CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, our results provide substantial support for our hypothesis. They provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the geographic variation in the severity of the HIV epidemic in Malawi and, potentially, in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",29422096,2018,Geographic variation in sexual behavior can explain geospatial heterogeneity in the severity of the HIV epidemic in Malawi.
1307,"BACKGROUND
Synthetic opioid overdose mortality among young adults has risen more than 300% in the USA since 2013, primarily due to the contamination of heroin and other drugs with illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Rapid test strips, which can be used to detect the presence of fentanyl in drug samples (before use) or urine (after use), may help inform people about their exposure risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether young adults who use drugs were willing to use rapid test strips as a harm reduction intervention to prevent overdose. We hypothesized that those who had ever overdosed would be more willing to use the test strips.


METHODS
We recruited a convenience sample of young adults who use drugs in Rhode Island from May to September 2017. Eligible participants (aged 18 to 35 with past 30-day drug use) completed an interviewer-administered survey. The survey assessed participant's socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, overdose risk, as well as suspected fentanyl exposure, and willingness to use take-home rapid test strips to detect fentanyl contamination in drugs or urine. Participants were then trained to use the test strips and were given ten to take home.


RESULTS
Among 93 eligible participants, the mean age was 27 years (SD = 4.8), 56% (n = 52) of participants were male, and 56% (n = 52) were white. Over one third (n = 34, 37%) had a prior overdose. The vast majority (n = 86, 92%) of participants wanted to know if there was fentanyl in their drug supply prior to their use. Sixty-five (70%) participants reported concern that their drugs were contaminated with fentanyl. After the brief training, nearly all participants (n = 88, 95%) reported that they planned to use the test strips.


CONCLUSIONS
More than 90% of participants reported willingness to use rapid test strips regardless of having ever overdosed, suggesting that rapid fentanyl testing is an acceptable harm reduction intervention among young people who use drugs in Rhode Island. Study follow-up is ongoing to determine whether, how, and under what circumstances participants used the rapid test strips and if a positive result contributed to changes in overdose risk behavior.",29422052,2018,High willingness to use rapid fentanyl test strips among young adults who use drugs.

Here, we report for the first time, a unique behavior where the deep-sea skate, Bathyraja spinosissima, appears to be actively using the elevated temperature of a hydrothermal vent environment to naturally ""incubate"" developing egg-cases. We hypothesize that this behavior is directly targeted to accelerate embryo development time given that deep-sea skates have some of the longest egg incubation times reported for the animal kingdom. Similar egg incubating behavior, where eggs are incubated in volcanically heated nesting grounds, have been recorded in Cretaceous sauropod dinosaurs and the rare avian megapode.

1309,"The large amount of nanoscale pores in shale results in the inability to apply Darcy's law. Moreover, the gas adsorption of shale increases the complexity of pore size characterization and thus decreases the accuracy of flow regime estimation. In this study, an apparent permeability model, which describes the adsorptive gas flow behavior in shale by considering the effects of gas adsorption, stress dependence, and non-Darcy flow, is proposed. The pore size distribution, methane adsorption capacity, pore compressibility, and matrix permeability of the Barnett and Eagle Ford shales are measured in the laboratory to determine the critical parameters of gas transport phenomena. The slip coefficients, tortuosity, and surface diffusivity are predicted via the regression analysis of the permeability data. The results indicate that the apparent permeability model, which considers second-order gas slippage, Knudsen diffusion, and surface diffusion, could describe the gas flow behavior in the transition flow regime for nanoporous shale. Second-order gas slippage and surface diffusion play key roles in the gas flow in nanopores for Knudsen numbers ranging from 0.18 to 0.5. Therefore, the gas adsorption and non-Darcy flow effects, which involve gas slippage, Knudsen diffusion, and surface diffusion, are indispensable parameters of the permeability model for shale.",29422663,2018,Multiparameter Analysis of Gas Transport Phenomena in Shale Gas Reservoirs: Apparent Permeability Characterization.
1310,"RATIONALE
Initial sensitivity to drugs of abuse often predicts subsequent use and abuse, but this relationship is not always observed in human studies. Moreover, studies examining the relationship between initial locomotor sensitivity and the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs in animal models have also been equivocal. Understanding the relationship between initial drug effects and propensity to continue use, potentially resulting in the development of a substance use disorder, may help to identify key targets for prevention and treatment.


OBJECTIVES
We examined intravenous cocaine self-administration in a set of mouse strains that were previously identified to be at the phenotypic extremes for cocaine-induced locomotor activation to determine if initial locomotor sensitivity predicted acquisition, extinction, dose response, or progressive ratio (PR) breakpoint.


METHODS
We selected eight inbred mouse strains based on locomotor sensitivity to 20 mg/kg cocaine. These strains, designated as low and high responders, were tested in an intravenous self-administration paradigm that included acquisition of 0.5 mg/(kg*inf) under a FR1 schedule, extinction, re-acquisition, dose response to 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/(kg*inf), and progressive ratio.


RESULTS
We observed overall differences in self-administration behavior between high and low responders. Low responders self-administered less cocaine and had lower breakpoints under the PR schedule. However, we also observed strain differences within each group. Self-administration in the low responder, LG/J, more closely resembled the behavior of the high-responding group, and the high responder, P/J, had self-administration behavior that more closely resembled the low-responding group.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that acute cocaine-induced locomotor activation does predict self-administration behavior, but in a strain-specific manner. These data support the idea that genetic background influences the relationship among addiction-related behaviors.",29423710,2018,Intravenous cocaine self-administration in a panel of inbred mouse strains differing in acute locomotor sensitivity to cocaine.
1311,"In the dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli), activational effects of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) in the regulation of paternal behavior have been repeatedly rejected because peripheral concentrations of E2 do not change across the reproductive cycle of males. Further, castration no affected paternal behavior despite that both T and E2 concentrations decreased significantly. However, the role of these hormones has not been evaluated in models of castration and hormonal replacement in virgin males. Here, we analysed the effects of E2 and T in paternal behavior in virgin male dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli). Thirty paternal (PAT) males were bilaterally castrated; of them, 10 were implanted with T, 10 with E2 and 10 males received no treatment. Other 10 PAT males underwent sham-castration. Seventeen aggressive (AGG) males were also bilaterally castrated; of these, 10 AGG received E2 replacement, 7 were not treated. Other 7 AGG males were submitted to sham-castration. Following treatments, paternal behavior tests were conducted again. T and E2 levels in plasma were quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The results showed that the treatments did not affect the paternal behavior of males that were initially paternal. Neither castration nor sham-castration surgery affected the behavior of AGG males. However, when these males were treated with E2 and the concentrations of this hormone increase significantly they became paternal. Our data suggest that an increase in E2 levels shifted infanticidal behavior to paternal behavior in dwarf hamster.",29425672,2018,An increase in estradiol facilitates the onset of paternal behavior in the dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli).

To comprehend the normal function and pathological characteristics of certain neurological disorders it is important to evaluate the neuroactive amino acids levels in animal models.


METHODS
This work describes a simple liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) method for the simultaneous determination of aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), using methyl-L-arginine as internal standard, in samples of rat brain tissue. The five target analytes (Asp, Glu, Gln, Tau and GABA) were determined in a single chromatographic run of less 11 min after a derivatization step with o-phthalaldehyde. The derivatives were separated on a reversed-phase C18 column and detected by fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 448 nm, respectively.


RESULTS
The method was validated in accordance with international guidelines on bioanalytical methods validation and it presented limits of quantification in the range of 25-50 ng mL-1 and calibration curves with determination coefficients (r2) equal to or higher than 0.9920. In addition, the precision (coefficient variation, %) and accuracy (bias, %) of the method meet the established criteria, and the stability of the analytes at the sample handling and storage conditions was demonstrated.


DISCUSSION
Unlike other similar bioanalytical assays, the current method was validated using diluted biological matrix, which is advantageous in order to ensure the derivatization process integrity. Moreover, this LC-FLD method was successfully applied for the determination of the compounds of interest in different rat brain tissue regions (frontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum). Thus, this bioanalytical assay represents a useful tool to support multiple nonclinical studies in the field of neurosciences, requiring the quantitative profiling and pattern analysis of neuroactive amino acids.",29425689,2018,An easy-to-use liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection for the simultaneous determination of five neuroactive amino acids in different regions of rat brain.
1313,"The extent to which N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors facilitate the motivation to voluntarily wheel-run in rodents has yet to be determined. In so, we utilized female Wistar rats selectively bred to voluntarily run high (HVR) and low (LVR) nightly distances in order to examine if endogenous differences in nucleus accumbens (NAc) NMDA receptor expression and function underlies the propensity for high or low motivation to voluntarily wheel-run. 12-14 week old HVR and LVR females were used to examine: 1.) NAc mRNA and protein expression of NMDA subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B; 2.) NMDA current responses in isolated medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and 3.) NMDA-evoked dopamine release in an ex vivo preparation of NAc punches. Expectedly, there was a large divergence in nightly running distance and time between HVR and LVR rats. We saw a significantly higher mRNA and protein expression of NR1 in HVR compared to LVR rats, while seeing no difference in the expression of NR2A or NR2B. There was a greater current response to a 500 ms application of 300 μM of NMDA in medium-spiny neurons isolated from the NAc HVR compared to LVR animals. On average, NMDA-evoked punches (50 μM of NMDA for 10 min) taken from HVR rats retained ∼54% of the dopamine content compared to their bilateral non-evoked sides, while evoked punches from LVR animals showed no statistical decrease in dopamine content compared to their non-evoked sides. Collectively, these data suggest a potential link between NAc NR1 subunit expression as well as NMDA function and the predisposition for nightly voluntary running behavior in rats. In light of the epidemic rise in physical inactivity, these findings have the potential to explain a neuro-molecular mechanism that regulates the motivation to be physically active.",29425730,2018,High and low nightly running behavior associates with nucleus accumbens N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) NR1 subunit expression and NMDAR functional differences.
1314,"RATIONALE
Mild hypoxia conditioning induced by repeated episodes of transient ischemia is a clinically applicable method for protecting the brain against injury after hypoxia-ischemic brain damage.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the effect of repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning on brain damage and long-term neural functional recovery after hypoxia-ischemic brain damage.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Rats received different protocols of repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning. Seven-day-old rats with hypoxia ischemic brain damage (HIBD) from the left carotid ligation procedure plus 2 h hypoxic stress (8% O2 at 37 °C) were further receiving repeated mild hypoxia intermittently. The gross anatomy, functional analyses, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) expression, and neuronal apoptosis of the rat brains were subsequently examined. Compared to the HIBD group, rats postconditioned with mild hypoxia had elevated HIF-1a expression, more Nissl-stain positive cells in their brain tissue and their brains functioned better in behavioral analyses. The recovery of the brain function may be directly linked to the inhibitory effect of HIF-1α on neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, there were significantly less neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region of the rats postconditioned with mild hypoxia, which might also be related to the higher HIF-1a expression and better brain performance. Overall, these results suggested that postconditioning of neonatal rats after HIBD with mild hypoxia increased HIF-1a expression, exerted a neuroprotective effect and promoted neural functional recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
Repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning protects neonatal rats with HIBD against brain damage and improves neural functional recovery.

1315,"Cannabinoids (CBs) play important roles in pain modulation. Recently, VD-hemopressin(β) [VD-Hpβ], a 12-residue β-hemoglobin-derived peptide, was reported to activate both CB1 and CB2 receptors in vitro. To further characterize in vivo actions of VD-Hpβ, its antinociceptive activity and site(s) were evaluated in the mouse tail-flick test, and supraspinal antinociception of VD-Hpβ was further assessed in the writhing test. Our results demonstrated that supraspinal, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administrations of VD-Hpβ produced analgesia in the tail-flick test. When given at the same levels, the CB1 antagonist AM251, rather than the CB2 antagonist AM630 diminished VD-Hpβ-induced antinociception. Furthermore, our results indicated that supraspinal, intrathecal or subcutaneous pretreatment with AM251 significantly inhibited VD-Hpβ-induced systemic antinociception. In the writhing test, supraspinal VD-Hpβ inhibited pain-related behaviors, which was partially prevented by AM251. Notably, supraspinal administration of VD-Hpβ failed to affect motor function at the antinociceptive doses. These findings suggest that VD-Hpβ induces CB1 receptor-mediated antinociception in tail-flick test in various routes of administration, and its systemic antinociception is mediated by both central and peripheral CB1 receptor. In addition, VD-Hpβ produces analgesic activity in the writhing test, which is at least partially mediated by CB1 receptor. Therefore, our present animal models show a CB1 agonistic character of VD-Hpβ, an endogenous cannabinoid peptide.",29425797,2018,Antinociceptive effects of the endogenous cannabinoid peptide agonist VD-hemopressin(β) in mice.
1316,"Sol-gel transition behavior of agarose aqueous solution was investigated by using rheology and fluorescence measurement. On heating, the storage modulus G' decreased gradually, then deviated abruptly at the temperature of about 65°C, and finally decreased slowly again. For fluorescence measurement, the phase transition point kept almost at the temperature of 65°C, which was consistent with that in rheology measurement. Upon compression, it was indicated that the fluorescence lifetime for the probe in the agarose aqueous solution showed a dramatic change in the vicinity of the phase transition point. T vs. P phase diagram of agarose aqueous solution was constructed, which showed that the melting point was an increasing function of pressure. Based on the phase diagram, the agarose gels were prepared by cooling under atmospheric pressure and the pressure of 300MPa, respectively. From the result of the recovered samples studied by optical rheometry, it was found that agarose gel prepared under high pressure had a higher elasticity and lower viscosity index, compared with that under atmospheric pressure. It could be speculated that such kinds of properties might be attributed to the smaller pore size during gelation under high pressure.",29425863,2018,In situ observation of sol-gel transition of agarose aqueous solution by fluorescence measurement.
1317,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
According to cognitive models, obsessive compulsive symptoms result from catastrophic misinterpretations of commonly occurring intrusive experiences and the use of counterproductive strategies to manage them. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) related beliefs such as inflated responsibility, importance of thoughts and perfectionism increases the likelihood of such misinterpretations. Consistent with a growing body of literature supporting the usefulness of mobile delivered technologies in fostering cognitive behavior change, the present study assessed the effectiveness of a novel cognitive training exercise designed to challenge OCD-related beliefs. This mobile app training exercise consists of users having to pull statements challenging OCD beliefs towards themselves (downwards) and to throw away (push upwards) contra-productive self-statements.


METHODS
36 third-year BA students started the trial. Twenty completed pre and post measures of OCD-beliefs, mood and OCD symptoms including relationship-obsessions. Participants were instructed to complete 3 min of daily training for a period of 15 days.


RESULTS
No significant differences were found between completers and non-completers on demographic and most symptom related measures at Time 1. Repeated-measures MANOVA of the 20 completers showed a significant reduction on all OCD symptoms measures and on OCD-beliefs. No significant reduction was found in depression symptoms. Regression analysis showed change in levels of OCD-beliefs was associated with reduction in OCD symptoms at Time 2 over and above OCD symptoms at Time 1.


LIMITATIONS

Whether this risk is reduced by switching to 'diet' beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) is controversial. Two experiments modeled whether a switch from SSB to LCS beverages produced positive outcomes on behavioral and metabolic measures. Both experiments consisted of a Stage 1, in which adult female rats received unrestricted access to 10% sucrose solution in addition to chow and water for 4 (Experiment 1) or 8 weeks (Experiment 2). In Stage 2 rats were switched to either saccharin (Suc-Sacch) or water (Suc-Water) or remained on 10% sucrose (Suc-Suc) for a further 4 (Experiment 1) or 7 weeks (Experiment 2). Experiment 2 contained a fourth group that was maintained on water throughout (Water-Water). In both experiments energy intake and weight gain in Stage 2 was reduced for Suc-Sacch and Suc-Water groups relative to the Suc-Suc groups and at cull the Suc-Suc groups showed poorer insulin sensitivity and greater g/kg fat than Suc-Water and Suc-Sacch groups. In Experiment 2 short-term place recognition memory was impaired at the end of Stage 1 but recovered to a similar extent in the Suc-Water and Suc-Sacch groups; when the latter groups were compared with the Water-Water group, recovery was found to be essentially complete. A higher saccharin concentration in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 increased absolute amounts of saccharin ingested but intake solution volumes remained low.

Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P. gingivalis-LPS) is one of the major pathogenic factors of chronic periodontitis (CP). Few reports on the correlation between P. gingivalis-LPS and cognitive function exist. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of P. gingivalis-LPS on cognitive function and the associated underlying mechanism in C57BL/6 mice.


METHODS
The C57BL/6 mice were injected with P. gingivalis-LPS (5 mg kg-1) either with or without Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor (TAK-242, 5 mg kg-1). After 7 days, behavioral alterations were assessed with the open field test (OFT), Morris water maze (MWM) test, and passive avoidance test (PAT). The activation of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice was observed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4), and CD14 and the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (IRAK1, p65, and p-p65) in the cerebral cortex of the mice were evaluated by RT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot.


RESULTS
The OFT showed that P. gingivalis-LPS did not affect the initiative and activity of mice. Administration of P. gingivalis-LPS significantly impaired spatial learning and memory during the MWM test and attenuated the ability of passive avoidance learning during the PAT. Both astrocytes and microglia were activated in the cortex and hippocampus. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) was upregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS in the cortex. In addition, the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated (TLR4, CD14, IRAK1, and p-p65). These effects were effectively alleviated by TAK-242.


CONCLUSIONS
Administration of P. gingivalis-LPS can lead to learning and memory impairment in C57BL/6 mice. This impairment is mediated by activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway.

Watching television is a common pastime for very young children. High exposure may negatively influence physical and mental health outcomes. Not much is known about how early exposure relates to lifestyle choices in adolescence.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate how toddler televiewing is subsequently associated with lifestyle indicators at adolescence.


METHODS
Participants are 986 girls and 999 boys from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development birth cohort (Canada). Child self-reports lifestyle habits at age 13 that were linearly regressed on parent-reported televiewing at age 2 while adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Every 1 h 13 m increase in daily televiewing was prospectively associated with a 8.2% increased risk of unhealthy eating habits (unstandardized b = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07), 10.1% decrease in eating breakfast on weekdays (unstandardized b = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.09 to -0.04), 13.3% increase in BMI (unstandardized b = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.50), 4.7% decrease in student engagement (unstandardized b = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.004), and 5.8% increase in concurrent screen time (unstandardized b = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.11).

We compared the change in HRQoL between those who did or did not quit smoking 6 months after hospital discharge. Participants were 1357 smokers recruited for a cessation trial between 2012 and 2014 while hospitalized at two hospitals in Massachusetts and one in Pennsylvania. Cessation was defined as biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months or as self-reported continuous abstinence at 1, 3, or 6 months post discharge. HRQoL measures included a single-item global health measure (SF1); the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) screening tool for psychological distress; and the EQ-5D-5L health utilities measure. Multivariable models controlled for age, sex, race, education, insurance, study site, study arm, discharge diagnoses, and baseline HRQoL. Improvements in HRQoL were evident in the first month after discharge among those achieving abstinence compared to continuing smokers. At 6 months post-discharge, those with biochemically confirmed cessation were 30% more likely to report at least good health by the SF1 (aRR 95% CI 1.14-1.45), 19% less likely to screen positive for psychological distress (aRR, 95% CI 0.68-0.93), and had EQ-5D-5L health utility scores 0.05 points (95% CI 0.02-0.08) higher than continuing smokers.

Moreover, participation in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been associated with obesity among low-income women. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors on diet quality and body mass index (BMI) of low-income women participating in SNAP. This study also aimed to examine the role of these factors in mediating the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality, and BMI. A total of 152 women receiving SNAP benefits were recruited from low-income neighborhood centers and housing communities, and administered a demographics questionnaire, the United States adult food security scale, food frequency questionnaire, and multi-dimensional home environment scale (MHES). They also were measured for height and weight to calculate BMI. The Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index 2015 was used to measure diet quality. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the MHES subscales that were significant predictors of diet quality and BMI. The Preacher and Hayes mediation model was used to evaluate the mediation of the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality, and BMI by the MHES.

1325,"The neurotrophic factors neuregulins (NRGs) and their receptors, ErbB tyrosine kinases, regulate neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions and their alterations have been associated to different neuropsychiatric disorders. Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRI)-dependent mechanisms are also altered in animal models of neuropsychiatric diseases, especially mGluRI-induced glutamatergic long-term depression (mGluRI-LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity critically involved in learning and memory. Despite this evidence, a potential link between NRGs/ErbB signalling and mGluRI-LTD has never been considered. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that NRGs/ErbB signalling regulates mGluRI functions in the hippocampus, thus controlling CA1 pyramidal neurons excitability and synaptic plasticity as well as mGluRI-dependent behaviors. We investigated the functional interaction between NRG1/ErbB signalling and mGluRI in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, by analyzing the effect of a pharmacological modulation of NRG1/ErbB signalling on the excitation of pyramidal neurons and on the LTD at CA3-CA1 synapses induced by an mGluRI agonist. Furthermore, we verified the involvement of ErbB signalling in mGluRI-dependent learning processes, by evaluating the consequence of an intrahippocampal in vivo injection of a pan-ErbB inhibitor in the object recognition test in mice, a learning task dependent on hippocampal mGluRI. We found that NRG1 potentiates mGluRI-dependent functions on pyramidal neurons excitability and synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses. Further, endogenous ErbB signalling per se regulates, through mGluRI, neuronal excitability and LTD in CA1 pyramidal neurons, since ErbB inhibition reduces mGluRI-induced neuronal excitation and mGluRI-LTD. In vivo intrahippocampal injection of the ErbB inhibitor, PD158780, impairs mGluRI-LTD at CA3-CA1 synapses and affects the exploratory behavior in the object recognition test. Thus, our results identify a key role for NRG1/ErbB signalling in the regulation of hippocampal mGluRI-dependent synaptic and cognitive functions, whose alteration might contribute to the pathogenesis of different brain diseases.",29427771,2018,Neuregulin 1/ErbB signalling modulates hippocampal mGluRI-dependent LTD and object recognition memory.

Norepinephrine (NE), a stress-related hormone and 17-β-estradiol (E2) thought to influence tau phosphorylation (p-tau) and AD pathology. The controversy around the impact of NE and E2 requires further clarification. Moreover, the combination effect of physiological and psychological stress and estrogen alteration during menopause, which affect p-tau, has not been addressed. Exposure to E2 is believed to reduce NE release, however, the link between these two hormones and AD at cellular level was also remained unknown. Here, we examined whether NE and E2 treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells affected tau phosphorylation. The involvement of adenosine monophosphate kinase protein kinase (AMPK) and target of Rapamycin (mTOR) as the possible mechanisms, underlying this effect was also investigated. Subsequent to SH-SY5Y differentiation to mature neurons, we treated the cells with NE, E2 and NE plus E2 in presence and absence of Compound C and Rapamycin. Cell viability was not affected by our treatment while our Western blot and immunofluorescent findings showed that exposure to NE and E2 separately, and in combination enhanced p-tau (Ser396) and (Ser262)/tau but not (Ser202/Thr205)/tau. Blocking AMPK by Compound C reduced p-tau (Ser396) and (Ser262), while GSK-3β and PP2A activities were remained unchanged. We also found that blocking mTOR by Rapamycin did not change increased p-tau (Ser396) and (Ser262) due to NE + E2 treatment.

1327,"BACKGROUND
Delayed completion of human papillomavirus vaccination (4vHPV) series is common. We sought to identify factors associated with delay.


METHODS
This substudy was part of a large prospective, multi-site study recruiting 9-17 year old girls at the time of their third 4vHPV dose to assess immunogenicity associated with prolonged dosing intervals. At participating sites, parents/legal guardians (caregivers) of all enrolled girls (9-17 years old) and enrolled girls aged 14-17 years were approached for participation. Caregivers completed a questionnaire measuring adolescent and caregiver sociodemographic characteristics, caregiver attitudes and beliefs about on-schedule HPV vaccination and HPV vaccine safety, adolescent's health behaviors, barriers to accessing health care, provider office vaccination practices and a Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Participating girls completed a separate questionnaire measuring their attitudes and beliefs about on-schedule HPV vaccination and HPV vaccine safety. Delay was defined as receiving the third 4vHPV dose >12 months after the first. Bivariate, multinomial logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predicting delayed completion.


RESULTS
Questionnaires were completed by 482 caregivers and 386 adolescents; 422 caregivers completed a REALM. Delayed 4vHPV dosing occurred in most adolescents (67%). In multivariate analyses, predictors of delayed completion included caregiver demographic factors (self-reported black vs. white race and high school or less education vs. college or more) and an interaction between caregiver's inability to get an immunization appointment as soon as needed and adolescent's type of insurance.


CONCLUSIONS
Caregiver's race and educational level, accessibility of immunization appointments, and adolescent's insurance type were found to be related to delays in completion of 4vHPV, but caregiver or adolescent attitudes and beliefs about on-schedule HPV vaccination or HPV vaccine safety were not. Therefore, interventions to improve adherence to recommended vaccination schedules could benefit from a focus on improving access to immunizations.

1328,"We demonstrated the attachment of different kinds of dyes, Uranine, Rhodamime 800 (R800), and Indocyanine green (ICG), to single-walled carbon nanotubes pre-wrapped with single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA-SWCNTs). A new but simple method was employed, in which a dye solution was added to ssDNA-SWCNTs that had been prepared beforehand in the conventional way. Resulting conjugates of dyes, DNA, and SWCNTs were precisely evaluated by ultraviolet to near-infrared fluorescence/absorbance spectrometry and atomic force microscopy. In particular, simultaneous measurements of fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy enabled us to find differences in the behaviors of the dyes on SWCNT surfaces. As a result, the fluorescence/absorbance spectra of dyes showed significant changes upon adsorption on SWCNTs. The fluorescence/absorbance peaks of Uranine, R800, and ICG were quenched by 41.3/2.8%, 72.3/48.9%, and 88.3/45.0%, respectively, in the presence of 11.5 μg/mL SWCNTs. We concluded firstly that by pre-wrapping SWCNTs with ssDNA, stable hybrids with these components were obtained even if the dyes used were relatively hydrophobic and secondly that Uranine retained light absorption on the surface of SWCNT while R800 and ICG did not.",29428378,2018,A convenient method of attaching fluorescent dyes on single-walled carbon nanotubes pre-wrapped with DNA molecules.
1329,"Individuals with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) experience episodic memory deficits that may be progressive in nature. These memory decrements have been shown to increase with the extent of hippocampal damage, a hallmark feature of TLE. Pattern separation, a neural computational mechanism thought to play a role in episodic memory formation, has been shown to be negatively affected by aging and in individuals with known hippocampal dysfunction. Despite the link between poor pattern separation performance and episodic memory deficits, behavioral pattern separation has not been examined in patients with TLE. We examined pattern separation performance in a group of 22 patients with medically-refractory TLE and 20 healthy adults, using a task hypothesized to measure spatial pattern separation with graded levels of spatial interference. We found that individuals with TLE showed less efficient spatial pattern separation performance relative to healthy adults. Poorer spatial pattern separation performance in TLE was associated with poorer visuospatial memory, but only under high interference conditions. In addition, left hippocampal atrophy was associated with poor performance in the high interference condition in TLE. These data suggest that episodic memory impairments in patients with chronic, refractory TLE may be partially due to less efficient pattern separation, which likely reflects their underlying hippocampal dysfunction.",29428769,2018,Impaired spatial pattern separation performance in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with visuospatial memory deficits and hippocampal volume loss.
1330,"Brain direct current (DC) potentials denote sustained shifts and slow deflections of cerebral potentials superimposed with conventional electroencephalography (EEG) waves and reflect alterations in the excitation level of the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures. Using galvanometers, such sustained displacement of the EEG baseline was recorded in the early days of EEG recordings. To stabilize the EEG baseline and eliminate artefacts, EEG was performed later by voltage amplifiers with high-pass filters that dismiss slow DC potentials. This left slow DC potential recordings as a neglected diagnostic source in the routine clinical setting over the last few decades. Brain DC waves may arise from physiological processes or pathological phenomena. Recordings of DC potentials are fundamental electro-clinical signatures of some neurological and psychological disorders and may serve as diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment monitoring tools.

1332,"Understanding neural representations of behavioral routines is critical for understanding complex behavior in health and disease. We demonstrate here that accentuated activity of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) at the beginning and end of such behavioral repertoires is a supraordinate representation specifically marking previously rewarded behavioral sequences independent of the individual movements making up the behavior. We recorded spike activity in the striatum and primary motor cortex as individual rats learned specific rewarded lever-press sequences, each one unique to a given rat. Motor cortical neurons mainly responded in relation to specific movements regardless of their sequence of occurrence. By contrast, striatal SPN populations in each rat fired preferentially at the initiation and termination of its acquired sequence. Critically, the SPNs did not exhibit this bracketing signal when the same rats performed unreinforced sequences containing the same sub-movements that were present in their acquired sequence. Thus, the SPN activity was specifically related to a given repetitively reinforced movement sequence. This striatal beginning-and-end activity did not appear to be dependent on motor cortical inputs. However, strikingly, simultaneously recorded fast-spiking striatal interneurons (FSIs) showed equally selective but inverse firing patterns: they fired in between the initiation and termination of the acquired sequences. These findings suggest that the striatum contains networks of neurons representing acquired sequences of behavior at a level of abstraction higher than that of the individual movements making up the sequence. We propose that such SPN-FSI networks of the striatum could underlie the acquisition of chunked behavioral units.",29429614,2018,Inversely Active Striatal Projection Neurons and Interneurons Selectively Delimit Useful Behavioral Sequences.
1333,"Greenhouse gas emissions originating from fossil fuel combustion contribute significantly to global warming, and therefore the design of novel materials that efficiently capture CO2 can play a crucial role in solving this challenge. Here, we show that reducing the dimensionality of bulk crystalline portlandite results in a stable monolayer material, named portlandene, that is highly effective at capturing CO2. On the basis of theoretical analysis comprised of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations and force-field molecular dynamics simulations, we show that this single-layer phase is robust and maintains its stability even at high temperatures. The chemical activity of portlandene is seen to further increase upon defect engineering of its surface using vacancy sites. Defect-containing portlandene is capable of separating CO and CO2 from a syngas (CO/CO2/H2) stream, yet is inert to water vapor. This selective behavior and the associated mechanisms have been elucidated by examining the electronic structure, local charge distribution, and bonding orbitals of portlandene. Additionally, unlike conventional CO2 capturing technologies, the regeneration process of portlandene does not require high temperature heat treatment because it can release the captured CO2 by application of a mild external electric field, making portlandene an ideal CO2 capturing material for both pre- and postcombustion processes.",29432023,2018,Highly Surface-Active Ca(OH)2 Monolayer as a CO2 Capture Material.

The study examined the association of neighborhood walkability to multiple activity-related outcomes and BMI among adolescents and evaluated socioeconomic status as an effect modifier.


METHOD
Cross-sectional study, with adolescents recruited from neighborhoods that met criteria for a 2 × 2 matrix defined by high/low GIS-defined walkability and high/low median income. Adolescents aged 12-16 years (n = 928) were recruited from selected neighborhoods in Maryland and King County, Washington regions in 2009-2011. There were 50.4% girls, and 66.3% were non-Hispanic white, with no medical restrictions on physical activity (PA) or diets. Total PA and sedentary time was assessed by 7 days of accelerometer monitoring. Adolescents self-reported active transport, time spent on 6 sedentary behaviors, and height and weight, used to compute BMI percentiles. Mixed model linear and logistic regressions examined outcomes for association with walkability and income, adjusting for demographic covariates and clustering within block groups.


RESULTS
Walkability was positively and significantly related to objectively-measured PA (p < .001) and more frequent walking for transportation (p < .001). Total self-reported sedentary time (p = .048) and TV time (p < .007) were negatively related to walkability. Time in vehicles was negatively related to walkability only among higher-income adolescents.


CONCLUSIONS
Neighborhood walkability was strongly and consistently associated with adolescents' objectively-assessed total physical activity and reported active transportation. A novel finding was that adolescents living in walkable neighborhoods reported less television time and less time in vehicles. Most results were similar across income categories. Results strengthen the rationale for recommendations to improve walkability.",29432790,2018,"Neighborhood built environment and socioeconomic status in relation to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight status of adolescents."

A variety of behavioral tests and theoretical models have been developed that provide a standardized toolbox of behavioral test paradigms available to researchers, and thus allow rapid progress in studies of the molecular-genetic bases of behavior relevant to neurocognitive diseases. However, a growing effort to utilize standardized paradigms has overlooked the diverse behavioral characteristics of test rodents expressed in standardized test situations. This review describes two popular test paradigms for cognitive assessment in rodents: social recognition and fear conditioning tasks. An extensive assessment of observed behavior during testing indicates a need to further elucidate the sequential strategic processes employed by test animals in conjunction with the use of standardized test settings and dependent variables.

Among many vitamin D and myokines are under consideration. We, therefore, evaluated the influence of a single session of and regular Nordic Walking (NW) training combined with vitamin D supplementation on cognitive functions and muscle strength and some elements of the amino-acid profile. Thirty-five healthy elderly women (68 ± 5 years old) from health promotion programmes took part in the study. At baseline they were divided into two groups: women, who participated in NW training for the first time (Beginners Group: BG) and women, who continued regular NW training longer than four years (Advance Group: AG). All women had a similar concentration of vitamin D (above 20 ng·ml-1) at baseline. The 12 weeks of NW training was supported by supplementation of vitamin D3 (4000 IU/day). Muscle strength, serum concentrations of myokines (irisin and IL-6), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammation marker, glucose, branched amino acids and tryptophan were all assessed at baseline, 1 h after the first single training session and adequately at the end of the training programme. In addition, iron and ferritin were measured. The concentration of vitamin D3 as well as psychological (Quality-of-Life Assessment, The Beck Depression Inventory-2) and cognitive evaluations (D2 test of attention, Trial Making Test A&B) were also performed before and after the 12-week training programme. Data were interpreted using magnitude-based inferences. According to data obtained in this study, regular NW training resulted in improvement of cognitive functions in aged women. These positive changes were accompanied by an increase of irisin and BDNF concentration (adjusted effect moderate and likely). Our data also revealed that observed reductions of glucose and tryptophan concentrations might have positively contributed to the amelioration of cognitive functions. Still, obtained results indicated that it was not the level vitamin D that modulated exercise-induced changes, but rather the long-lasting experience and being more advanced in training.",29432893,2018,Improvement of cognitive functions in response to a regular Nordic walking training in elderly women - A change dependent on the training experience.

Frailty has been recognized as an important medical syndrome in older adults. Growing literature supports the clinical application of frailty but US older adults' perceptions of frailty have not been explored. We aim to examine perceptions and informational needs about frailty among older adults.


METHODS
This was a qualitative study involving focus groups of community-dwelling older adults with diverse age and frailty status. We explored participants' beliefs and knowledge about frailty and informational needs about frailty as a medical syndrome.


RESULTS
The participants' mean age was 76.3. Of the 29 participants, 21 (72%) were female, and 21 (72%) were white. We identified three major themes: 1) Older adults' perceptions of frailty differed from the definition used in medical literature; they often perceived a psychological component to being frailty and some were skeptical of the syndromic definition based on multiple symptoms. 2) Compared to participants who were non-frail or pre-frail, participants who were frail were more receptive to discussing their frailty status with clinicians; 3) Participants wanted know about how to treat or prevent frailty and the risks associated with being frail. Many participants felt that these information can be conveyed without necessarily using the specific term ""frail"", which they perceived to have a negative connotation.


CONCLUSIONS
Older adults, especially those who are frail, may be interested to discuss frailty as a medical syndrome. However, negative perceptions are associated with the term ""frail"" and may be a barrier to clinical application of frailty. Further research is needed to understand acceptable ways for communicating about frailty in clinical practice.",29433426,2018,Older adults' perceptions and informational needs regarding frailty.

The pattern of alcohol consumption in Ireland has serious societal and health consequences. General practice is well placed to screen for problem alcohol use and to carry out brief interventions. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of documentation of problem alcohol use in patient records in Irish general practice, and to describe the documentation of its diagnosis and treatment.


METHODS
General practitioners (GPs) affiliated with an Irish medical school were invited to participate in the study. One hundred patients were randomly selected from each participating practice using the practice software and the clinical records were reviewed for evidence of problem alcohol use. The following was recorded: patient demographics, whether problem alcohol use was documented, whether they had an intervention, a psychotropic medication or if a referral was made. Descriptive statistics and an estimate of the prevalence were calculated using SPSS and SAS software.


RESULTS
Seventy one percent of the practices participated (n = 40), generating a sample of 3, 845 active patients. Only 57 patients (1.5%, 95% confidence interval 1 to 2%) were identified as having problem alcohol use in the previous two years. 29 (51%) of those with documented problem alcohol use were referred to other specialist services. 28 (49%) received a psychological intervention. 40 (70%) were prescribed psychotropic medications.

1339,"BACKGROUND
Species recognition, i.e., the ability to distinguish conspecifics from heterospecifics, plays an essential role in reproduction. The role of facial cues for species recognition has been investigated in several non-human primate species except for lemurs. We therefore investigated the role of facial cues for species recognition in wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) at Kirindy Forest. We presented adult red-fronted lemurs pictures of male faces from five species including red-fronted lemurs, three closely related species, white-fronted lemurs (E. albifrons), brown lemurs (E. fulvus), rufous brown lemurs (E. rufus), and genetically more distant red-bellied lemurs (E. rubriventer), occurring in allopatry with the study population. We predicted that red-fronted lemurs respond stronger to conspecific than to heterospecific pictures and that females show stronger responses than males. In addition, if genetic drift has played a role in the evolution of facial color patterns in the members of this genus, we predicted that responses of red-fronted lemurs correlate negatively with the genetic distance to the different species stimuli.


RESULTS
Red-fronted lemurs looked significantly longer at pictures of their own species than at those of heterospecifics. Females spent less time looking at pictures of white-fronted, brown and red-bellied lemurs than males did, but not to pictures of red-bellied lemurs and a control stimulus. Individuals also exhibited sniffing behavior while looking at visual stimuli, and the time spent sniffing was significantly longer for pictures of conspecifics compared to those of heterospecifics. Moreover, the time spent looking and sniffing towards the pictures correlated negatively with the genetic distance between their own species and the species presented as stimulus.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that red-fronted lemurs have the ability for species recognition using visual facial cues, which may allow them to avoid costly interbreeding. If so, sexual selection might have influenced the evolution of facial patterns in eulemurs. Since responses also correlated with genetic distance, our findings suggest a potential role of genetic drift as well as sexual selection in influencing the evolution of facial variation in eulemurs. Because study subjects looked and sniffed towards the presented pictures, red-fronted lemurs might have the ability for multi-modal species recognition.",29433448,2018,The role of facial pattern variation for species recognition in red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons).

Despite the significant impact of migraine on patients and societies, few studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have investigated the association between migraine and suicidal behavior. The objective of our study is to examine the extent to which migraines are associated with suicidal behavior (including suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts) in a well-characterized study of urban dwelling Ethiopian adults.


METHODS
We enrolled 1060 outpatient adults attending St. Paul hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographics, and lifestyle characteristics. Migraine classification was based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 diagnostic criteria. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess depression and suicidal behaviors (i.e. ideation, plans and attempts). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).


RESULTS
The prevalence of suicidal behavior was 15.1%, with a higher suicidal behavior among those who had migraines (61.9%). After adjusting for confounders including substance use and socio-demographic factors, migraine was associated with a 2.7-fold increased odds of suicidal behavior (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.88-3.89). When stratified by their history of depression in the past year, migraine without depression was significantly associated with suicidal behavior (AOR: 2.27, 95% Cl: 1.49-3.46). The odds of suicidal behavior did not reach statistical significance in migraineurs with depression (AOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 0.40-6.69).


CONCLUSION
Our study indicates that migraine is associated with increased odds of suicidal behavior in this population. Given the serious public health implications this has, attention should be given to the treatment and management of migraine at a community level.",29433452,2018,Association between migraine and suicidal behavior among Ethiopian adults.

Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually. Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan.


METHOD
This study was based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework of scoping review, combining peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet.com were searched from the beginning of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language.


RESULTS
Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides was mentioned in only three studies.

This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors.",29433468,2018,Suicide and deliberate self-harm in Pakistan: a scoping review.
1342,"BACKGROUND
Patients with advanced lung cancer (LC) or malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) exhibit limitation of exercise capacities and alteration of quality of life (QoL) induced by cancer and its treatment. Few studies assessed pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in these chemotherapy-treated patients, and none evaluated a home-based PR program.


METHODS
In this prospective uncontrolled observational pilot study, patients treated by chemotherapy for LC or MPM were screened for a home-based PR program combining exercise training with global cares including therapeutic education and psychosocial management. Feasibility and safety were evaluated by attendance and adherence to PR program. Various exercise tolerance tests, including 6-min walk test (6MWT) and 6-min stepper test (6MST), were performed before and after PR associated with, QoL and psychological assessment (VSRQ and HAD, respectively).


RESULTS
243 patients were considered eligible but only 71 (60.6 ± 8.8 years) started a PR and 47 completed the program. Refusals to participate were mostly related to lack of motivation whereas withdrawals to PR were related to cancer-related medical issues. No adverse event related to PR was observed. Baseline 6MWT distance was associated with performance status (r = - 0.45, p = 0.001) and mMRC dyspnea scale (r = - 0.49, p < 0.001) but not with lung cancer stage. Post-PR reassessment showed 6MWT stability and 6MST improvement in patients who completed the program. Daily physical activity (p = 0.007) and anxiety (p = 0.02) scores were significantly improved.


CONCLUSIONS
Home-based PR was feasible and safe in patients with advanced LC or MPM. Exercise capacities stability in patients who completed the PR program suggests that PR might be beneficial.

1343,"BACKGROUND
Tinnitus service provision in the United Kingdom has been investigated from the healthcare provider's perspective demonstrating considerable regional variation particularly regarding availability of psychological treatments. An audiological-based tinnitus service, however, was reportedly available for all tinnitus patients in the UK. The aim of the current study was to define and evaluate nationwide tinnitus healthcare services from the patients' viewpoint.


METHODS
Secondary analyses were performed on data from a 33-item questionnaire provided by the British Tinnitus Association. The questionnaire had been distributed via email and social media.


RESULTS
Responses from 937 participants who had or had previously experienced tinnitus were analysed. All but one person had at some time consulted their GP. About one in five received medication in primary care. The majority were referred to secondary care, generally an ENT surgeon or audiovestibular physician; some were referred directly to audiological services. In secondary care the majority underwent audiometric testing and over half underwent MRI scanning. Drugs were prescribed less frequently in secondary care. About one third of patients were referred onwards from diagnostic services in secondary care to receive therapeutic interventions for tinnitus. Therapy was generally delivered by an audiologist or hearing therapist. Just under two fifths of people discharged from secondary care returned to their GP, with most returning within one year. Over a third of this group were re-referred to secondary care. Few patients saw a psychologist (2.6%) though some psychological treatments were delivered by appropriately trained audiologists. Negative counselling from healthcare professionals in both primary and secondary care settings was reported.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the UK has developed a national service for patients with tinnitus many people find it difficult to access, being blocked at the primary care level or after secondary care diagnostic services. Many of those discharged from secondary care return to their GP within a short space of time and are re-referred to secondary care creating an unsatisfactory and expensive revolving-door pattern of healthcare. Despite psychological treatment modalities having the best evidence base for successful tinnitus management, only a minority of tinnitus patients ever get to meet a psychologist.",29433479,2018,Tinnitus services in the United Kingdom: a survey of patient experiences.
1344,"BACKGROUND
Hospital stay represents the opportunity for a change of therapy, about which patients may not know indications, contraindications, and mode of administration, which may lead to dosing errors, drug interactions, side effects, etc. It is therefore vital to communicate appropriate information to the discharged patient with a new prescription drug. The purpose of the study was to evaluate: 1) how communication about new chronic therapies is managed at hospital discharge and what kind of information is provided to patients; 2) to what extent patients are aware and confident in the management of these medications; 3) whether the way communication is provided affects patients' awareness and self-confidence in the management of these therapies.


METHODS
Participants were adult patients who were prescribed at least one new chronic medication at hospital discharge. A telephone interview after hospital discharge was performed to assess whether or not hospital healthcare personnel had given information about prescribed therapies and which aspects of therapies had been object of information.


RESULTS
Five hundred thirty patients were interviewed. 67.7% reported having received counseling by the hospital physician, while 32.3% by discharge form. Basic information on treatment was provided to the great majority of patients, whereas only few patients reported to have been informed about eventual side effects and related behavior in case of side effects.


CONCLUSIONS
Several aspects of patients' knowledge and self-confidence on long term medications prescribed at hospital discharge need to be improved and the way communication is provided has a crucial role in the empowerment of patients in the management of these medications.",29433486,2018,Information about management of chronic drug therapies prescribed at hospital discharge: does it affect patients' knowledge and self-confidence?

Cervical cancer is a very common disease among women in Ghana and in the world as a whole. However, there is a dearth of information on the mechanisms cervical cancer patients adopt to cope with the condition in Ghana. This study sought to explore the strategies adopted by cervical cancer patients in rural Ghana to cope with the disease.


METHODS
In-depth interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data from cervical cancer patients in a health facility in the Volta Region of Ghana. Data processing was done using the R software package for Qualitative Data Analysis (RQDA) and a thematic approach was used to analyse and present the results.


RESULTS
The results show that cervical cancer patients adopted personal and psychological strategies such as sexual abstinence, personal hygiene, and disease denial to cope with the condition. Respondents also described social, financial and non-material support services they received from family members and the church as critical resources, which helped them to manage the conditions of the disease. Respondents also reported that faith healing, herbal and orthodox medicines helped them to manage the symptoms of the disease.


CONCLUSIONS
Cervical cancer patients used a variety of coping strategies to manage the disease. Yet, it will be essential for interventions to focus on strengthening knowledge about the disease.

Methotrexate (MTX), commonly used in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), frequently has to be discontinued due to intolerance with anticipatory and associative gastrointestinal adverse effects. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological method where dysfunctional experiences and memories are reprocessed by recall combined with bilateral eye movements. The objective of this study was to assess efficacy of EMDR for treatment of MTX intolerance in JIA patients.


METHODS
We performed an open prospective study on consecutive JIA patients with MTX intolerance. Intolerance was determined using the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score (MISS) questionnaire prior to treatment, directly after treatment and after four months. Health-related quality of life was determined using the PedsQL prior to and four months after treatment. Patients were treated according to an institutional EMDR protocol with 8 sessions over two weeks. Changes in MISS and PedsQL were analyzed using non-parametric statistics.


RESULTS
Eighteen patients with MTX intolerance (median MISS at inclusion 16.5, IQR = 11.75-20.25) were included. Directly after treatment, MTX intolerance symptoms were significantly improved (median MISS 1 (IQR = 0-2). After four months, median MISS score was at 6.5 (IQR = 2.75-12.25, p = 0.001), with 9/18 patients showing MISS scores ≥6. Median PedsQL after 4 months improved significantly from 77.6% to 85.3% (p = 0.008).


CONCLUSION
MTX intolerance in children with JIA was effectively treated using an EMDR protocol, with lasting effect over a period of 4 months.

Outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may result in death, increased morbidity, and change in quality of life (QOL). This study explores health-related QOL of first-time patients following AMI.


METHODS
This cross-sectional study used a sample of patients with first-time AMI experienced between April 2011 and March 2015 at a tertiary health institution. Recruited patients belonged to different post-AMI periods: 2-10 weeks, 5-22 months, and > 22 months to 4 years post AMI. Inclusion criteria were not confused and communicating freely. Exclusion criteria were non-contactable, refusing to participate, and deceased. One-on-one interviews were conducted using the validated and pre-tested Quality of Life after Myocardial Infarction (QLMI) questionnaire. QOL of patients after AMI was evaluated at each period. Descriptive, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and regression analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24.


RESULTS
A total of 534 participant interviews (overall response rate 65.4%) were conducted. Interviewees were predominantly male (67%), aged 51-65 years (45%), Indo-Trinidadian (81.2%), NSTEMI (64.4%), and hypertensive (72.4%). Overall QOL improved over time and in all domains: Emotional, Physical, and Social. Lower QOL was found among women, patients with NSTEMI, and diabetics in all domains; in patients with hypertension and renal disease in the Physical and Social domains only; and in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in the Physical domain only. Self-reported stress and lack of exercise were associated with lower QOL while drinking alcohol and eating out were related to better QOL. Hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and ethnicity showed no association with QOL. Declining QOL in the Physical domain with age was also found. The leading components of QOL were self-confidence and social exclusion (early post AMI), lack of self-confidence (intermediate post AMI), and tearfulness (late post AMI).


CONCLUSIONS
QOL in AMI survivors improves over time. Female gender, NSTEMI, diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, stress, and lack of exercise were associated with lower QOL while hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and ethnicity showed no association with QOL. Cardiac rehabilitation and psychological support may enhance earlier increased QOL among survivors, particularly among vulnerable groups.",29433517,2018,Quality of life of patients with first-time AMI: a descriptive study.
1348,"BACKGROUND
Pancreatic cancer characterizes high recurrence and poor prognosis. In clinical practice, radiotherapy is widely used for pancreatic cancer treatment. However, the outcome remains undesirable due to tumor repopulation and following recurrence and metastasis after radiation. So, it is highly needed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms and accordingly develop therapeutic strategies. Our previous studies revealed that dying cells from chemoradiation could stimulate repopulation of surviving pancreatic cancer cells. However, we still knew little how dying cells provoke pancreatic cancer cell repopulation. We herein would explore the significance of TGF-β2 changes and investigate the modulation of microRNA-193a (miR-193a), and identify their contributions to pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis.


METHODS
In vitro and in vivo repopulation models were established to mimic the biological processes of pancreatic cancer after radiation. Western blot, real-time PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assays were accordingly used to detect miR-193a and TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signalings at the level of molecular, cellular and experimental animal model, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis, wound healing and transwell assay, vascular endothelial cell penetration experiment, and bioluminescence imaging were employed to assessthe biological behaviors of pancreatic cancer after different treatments. Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mice models were established to evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-193a antagonist on pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis after radiation.


RESULTS
miR-193a was highly expressed in the irradiated pancreatic cancer dying cells, accordingly elevated the level of miR-193a in surviving cells, and further promoted pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. miR-193a accelerated pancreatic cancer cell cycle and stimulated cell proliferation and repopulation through inhibiting TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII/SMADs/E2F6/c-Myc signaling, and even destroyed normal intercellular junctions and promoted metastasis via repressing TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII/ARHGEF15/ABL2 pathway. Knockdown of miR-193a or restoration of TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signaling in pancreatic cancer cells was found to block pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis after radiation. In PDX models, the treatment in combination with miR-193a antagonist and radiation was found to dramatically inhibit pancreatic cancer cell repopulation and metastasis, and further improved the survival after radiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated that miR-193a stimulated pancreatic cancer cell repopulation and metastasis through modulating TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signalings, and miR-193a might be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis.",29433538,2018,microRNA-193a stimulates pancreatic cancer cell repopulation and metastasis through modulating TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signalings.
1349,"BACKGROUND
Delirium is a frequent and detrimental complication of inpatient hospitalization. Multicomponent intervention in selected groups has been shown to prevent and treat delirium, though little data exists on the effect of intervention in neurological patients. We studied the efficacy of a multicomponent delirium care pathway implemented on a largely neurology and neurosurgery hospital ward among unselected patients.


METHODS
We incorporated a multicomponent delirium care pathway into the workflow of a university hospital for patients older than 50 years. The pathway involved risk-stratification for development of delirium, delirium screening, and non-pharmacologic behavioral prevention and intervention. We then retrospectively reviewed admissions before and after implementation of the care pathway. Our primary endpoint was incidence of delirium; secondary endpoints included delirium days, length of stay, restraint use, readmission rates, and discharge disposition.


RESULTS
Seven hundred ninety eight admissions from before the delirium care pathway went into effect and 797 admissions from afterwards were reviewed. Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Delirium incidence between the two groups did not change (7.0% before vs 7.2% after, p = 0.89). Length of stay among delirious patients significantly decreased after implementation of the delirium care pathway (9.60 before vs 7.06 after, β = - 0.16, adjusted p-value = 0.001).


CONCLUSION
Implementation of a delirium care pathway on a neurosciences ward was not associated with changes in the rate of delirium development, though length of stay among delirious patients decreased. In a largely neurologic population, multicomponent intervention to prevent and treat delirium may not change delirium incidence, but may be effective in mitigating delirium complications.",29433572,2018,Evaluation of a multicomponent pathway to address inpatient delirium on a neurosciences ward.

1351,"BACKGROUND
Women are increasingly involved in drunk driving and fatal crashes, yet except for the screening performed in criminal justice settings, little is known about their life context, psychiatric histories, and family backgrounds. This study describes a sample of women with histories of arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) who were interviewed outside a criminal justice setting and contrasts women with single versus multiple DUI convictions.


METHODS
Women with recent documented histories of DUI participated in a study of women's health behaviors. Thirty-six women with 1 DUI and 62 with 2 or more DUIs participated in a diagnostic telephone interview which assessed demographics, alcohol use and problems, psychiatric problems, treatment, and partner violence.


RESULTS
The sample overall had high rates of co-occurring psychiatric problems, parental alcohol problems, early sexual and physical abuse, and head injuries. Alcohol use severity and the prevalence of head injuries and partner alcohol problems were significantly higher among women with multiple DUIs than women with a single DUI. Measures reflecting life context, such as marital status, number of children, and childhood trauma, were not associated with number of DUIs.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest that DUI recidivism in women is accounted for primarily by AUD severity and is not influenced by previous life events such as partner violence, psychiatric problems, and family context such as divorce/separation or number of children. Multiple DUIs in women may mark an alcohol severity threshold beyond which few factors account for additional risk.",29437240,2018,Comparison of Characteristics of Female Drivers with Single and Multiple DUI Convictions.
1352,"The first detection of a quantum particle on a graph is shown to depend sensitively on the distance ξ between the detector and initial location of the particle, and on the sampling time τ. Here, we use the recently introduced quantum renewal equation to investigate the statistics of first detection on an infinite line, using a tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor hops. Universal features of the first detection probability are uncovered and simple limiting cases are analyzed. These include the large ξ limit, the small τ limit, and the power law decay with the attempt number of the detection probability over which quantum oscillations are superimposed. For large ξ the first detection probability assumes a scaling form and when the sampling time is equal to the inverse of the energy band width nonanalytical behaviors arise, accompanied by a transition in the statistics. The maximum total detection probability is found to occur for τ close to this transition point. When the initial location of the particle is far from the detection node we find that the total detection probability attains a finite value that is distance independent.",29437409,2018,First Detected Arrival of a Quantum Walker on an Infinite Line.

We address this issue in a driven-dissipative setup, focusing on the modulated open Dicke model, which can be implemented by cavity or circuit QED systems. In the thermodynamic limit, we employ semiclassical approaches and find rich dynamical phases on top of the discrete time-crystalline order. In a deep quantum regime with few qubits, we find clear signatures of a transient discrete time-crystalline behavior, which is absent in the isolated counterpart.

We find that the latent heat increases linearly with temperature at T≲1.1  K, similarly to a Bose-Einstein condensate transition, and becomes constant at 1.1≲T<4.8  K. Resonant Rayleigh scattering measurements reveal that the disorder in the sample is strongly suppressed and the diffusion coefficient sharply increases with decreasing temperature at T<T_{C}, allowing the liquid to spread over large distances away from the excitation region.

We establish that the structural distortion at T_{c} is a secondary effect through the absence of any softening of its associated phonon mode, which supports a purely electronically driven mechanism. However, the phonon lifetime exhibits an anomalously strong temperature dependence that decreases linearly to zero near T_{c}. We show that this behavior naturally explains the spurious appearance of phonon softening in previous Raman spectroscopy experiments and should be a prevalent feature of correlated electron systems with linearly coupled order parameters.",29437453,2018,Evidence of an Improper Displacive Phase Transition in Cd_{2}Re_{2}O_{7} via Time-Resolved Coherent Phonon Spectroscopy.
1356,"Tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus play a role in inhibiting prolactin (PRL) secretion from the anterior pituitary. PRL is involved in a variety of behaviors, including feeding. Consequently, we hypothesized that fasting might reduce the activity of TIDA neurons, which might alter PRL secretion. However, direct examinations of TIDA neuron activity are difficult. Recently, transgenic mice were generated that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene. We first determined that GFP in the dorsomedial ARC was a reliable marker of TIDA neurons. Then, we performed electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry in GFP-labeled TIDA neurons to examine whether different feeding conditions could change their activity. Eight-week-old male mice were fed or fasted for 24 h. After sacrifice, we prepared acutely isolated brain slices for conducting whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. TIDA neurons were identified with fluorescence microscopy. The mean amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was significantly reduced in fasting mice compared to fed mice, but different feeding conditions did not affect the mean mEPSC intervals. This result suggested that fasting reduced the number of excitatory synaptic inputs to TIDA neurons. To determine whether a reduction in excitatory synaptic inputs would cause a reduction in TIDA neuron activity, we examined the effect of 24-h fasting on c-Fos expression in the ARC. We found that fasting significantly reduced the number of Fos-positive TIDA neurons. In addition, serum PRL levels were significantly increased. Taken together, the present findings suggested that short-term fasting attenuated TIDA neuron activity.",29438798,2018,Short-term fasting decreases excitatory synaptic inputs to ventromedial tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons and attenuates their activity in male mice.
1357,"Culture evolves according to dynamics on multiple temporal scales, from individuals' minute-by-minute behaviour to millennia of cultural accumulation that give rise to population-level differences. These dynamics act on a range of entities-including behavioural sequences, ideas and artefacts as well as individuals, populations and whole species-and involve mechanisms at multiple levels, from neurons in brains to inter-population interactions. Studying such complex phenomena requires an integration of perspectives from a diverse array of fields, as well as bridging gaps between traditionally disparate areas of study. In this article, which also serves as an introduction to the current special issue, we highlight some specific respects in which the study of cultural evolution has benefited and should continue to benefit from an integrative approach. We showcase a number of pioneering studies of cultural evolution that bring together numerous disciplines. These studies illustrate the value of perspectives from different fields for understanding cultural evolution, such as cognitive science and neuroanatomy, behavioural ecology, population dynamics, and evolutionary genetics. They also underscore the importance of understanding cultural processes when interpreting research about human genetics, neuroscience, behaviour and evolution.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",29440515,2018,Integrative studies of cultural evolution: crossing disciplinary boundaries to produce new insights.
1358,"Language plays a pivotal role in the evolution of human culture, yet the evolution of the capacity for language-uniquely within the hominin lineage-remains little understood. Bringing together insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, archaeology and behavioural ecology, we hypothesize that this singular occurrence was triggered by exaptation, or 'hijacking', of existing cognitive mechanisms related to sequential processing and motor execution. Observed coupling of the communication system with circuits related to complex action planning and control supports this proposition, but the prehistoric ecological contexts in which this coupling may have occurred and its adaptive value remain elusive. Evolutionary reasoning rules out most existing hypotheses regarding the ecological context of language evolution, which focus on ultimate explanations and ignore proximate mechanisms. Coupling of communication and motor systems, although possible in a short period on evolutionary timescales, required a multi-stepped adaptive process, involving multiple genes and gene networks. We suggest that the behavioural context that exerted the selective pressure to drive these sequential adaptations had to be one in which each of the systems undergoing coupling was independently necessary or highly beneficial, as well as frequent and recurring over evolutionary time. One such context could have been the teaching of tool production or tool use. In the present study, we propose the Cognitive Coupling hypothesis, which brings together these insights and outlines a unifying theory for the evolution of the capacity for language.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",29440518,2018,The evolution of the capacity for language: the ecological context and adaptive value of a process of cognitive hijacking.
1359,"Culture is a human universal, yet it is a source of variation in human psychology, behaviour and development. Developmental researchers are now expanding the geographical scope of research to include populations beyond relatively wealthy Western communities. However, culture and context still play a secondary role in the theoretical grounding of developmental psychology research, far too often. In this paper, we highlight four false assumptions that are common in psychology, and that detract from the quality of both standard and cross-cultural research in development. These assumptions are: (i) the universality assumption, that empirical uniformity is evidence for universality, while any variation is evidence for culturally derived variation; (ii) the Western centrality assumption, that Western populations represent a normal and/or healthy standard against which development in all societies can be compared; (iii) the deficit assumption, that population-level differences in developmental timing or outcomes are necessarily due to something lacking among non-Western populations; and (iv) the equivalency assumption, that using identical research methods will necessarily produce equivalent and externally valid data, across disparate cultural contexts. For each assumption, we draw on cultural evolutionary theory to critique and replace the assumption with a theoretically grounded approach to culture in development. We support these suggestions with positive examples drawn from research in development. Finally, we conclude with a call for researchers to take reasonable steps towards more fully incorporating culture and context into studies of development, by expanding their participant pools in strategic ways. This will lead to a more inclusive and therefore more accurate description of human development.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",29440524,2018,Variation is the universal: making cultural evolution work in developmental psychology.

Next, we recruited actual individuals with hikikomori, and compared avoidant personality traits, blood biomarkers, and psychological features between individuals with hikikomori and age-matched healthy controls. Individuals with hikikomori had higher avoidant personality scores in both sexes, and showed lower serum UA levels in men and lower HDL-C levels in women compared with healthy controls.

RESULTS
Cumulative proportions of participants reaching peak weight loss were as follows: 25.0% of study 1 and 20.0% of study 2 participants by month 4; 43.2% of study 1 and 52.2% of study 2 participants by month 6; 54.5% of study 1 and 77.8% of study 2 participants by month 8. Among participants who peaked after 4 months, the mean amount of additional weight loss achieved between 4 months and the peak session was 4.74 kg in study 1 and 4.07 kg in study 2.

These studies have examined everything from its fundamental role in the development of mice, flies, and fish to the intriguing enrichment of its target gene network in SCZ. Indeed, much of the excitement surrounding MIR137 is due to the distinct possibility that it could regulate a gene network involved in SCZ etiology, a disease which we now recognize is highly polygenic. Here we comprehensively review, to the best of our ability, all published genetic and biological evidence that could support or refute a role for MIR137 in the etiology of SCZ. Through a careful consideration of the literature, we conclude that the data gathered to date continues to strongly support the involvement of MIR137 and its target gene network in neuropsychiatric traits, including SCZ risk. There remain, however, more unanswered than answered questions regarding the mechanisms linking MIR137 genetic variation with behavior.

1366,"Although testosterone is associated with aggression in the popular imagination, previous research on the links between testosterone and human aggression has been inconsistent. This inconsistency might be because testosterone's effects on aggression depend on other moderators. In a large adolescent sample ( N = 984, of whom 460 provided hair samples), we examined associations between aggression and salivary testosterone, hair testosterone, and hair cortisol. Callous-unemotional traits, parental monitoring, and peer environment were examined as potential moderators of hormone-behavior associations. Salivary testosterone was not associated with aggression. Hair testosterone significantly predicted increased aggression, particularly at low levels of hair cortisol (i.e., Testosterone × Cortisol interaction). This study is the first to examine the relationship between hair hormones and externalizing behaviors and adds to the growing literature that indicates that androgenic effects on human behavior are contingent on aspects of the broader endocrine environment-in particular, levels of cortisol.",29443645,2018,"Hair and Salivary Testosterone, Hair Cortisol, and Externalizing Behaviors in Adolescents."
1367,"We report the formation of supramolecular adducts between monolayer-protected noble metal nanoclusters and fullerenes, specifically focusing on a well-known silver cluster, [Ag29(BDT)12]3-, where BDT is 1,3-benzenedithiol. We demonstrate that C60 molecules link with the cluster at specific locations and protect the fragile cluster core, enhancing the stability of the cluster. A combination of studies including UV-vis, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, collision-induced dissociation, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed structural details of the fullerene-functionalized clusters, [Ag29(BDT)12(C60)n]3- (n = 1-9). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular docking simulations affirm compatibility between the cluster and C60, resulting in its attachment at specific positions on the surface of the cluster, stabilized mainly by π-π and van der Waals interactions. The structures have also been confirmed from ion mobility mass spectrometry by comparing the experimental collision cross sections (CCSs) with the theoretical CCSs of the DFT-optimized structures. The gradual evolution of the structures with an increase in the number of fullerene attachments to the cluster has been investigated. Whereas the structure for n = 4 is tetrahedral, that of n = 8 is a distorted cube with a cluster at the center and fullerenes at the vertices. Another fullerene, C70, also exhibited similar behavior. Modified clusters are expected to show interesting properties.",29444405,2018,Fullerene-Functionalized Monolayer-Protected Silver Clusters: [Ag29(BDT)12(C60)n]3- (n = 1-9).
1368,"BACKGROUND
Three billion people use solid cooking fuels, and 4 million people die from household air pollution annually. Shifting households to clean fuels, like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), may protect health only if stoves are consistently used. Few studies have used an implementation science framework to systematically assess ""de-implementation"" of traditional stoves, and none have done so with pregnant women who are more likely to adopt new behaviors. We evaluated an introduced LPG stove coupled with a phased behavioral intervention to encourage exclusive gas stove use among pregnant women in rural Guatemala.


METHODS
We enrolled 50 women at < 20 weeks gestation in this prospective cohort study. All women received a free 3-burner LPG stove and ten tank refills. We conducted formative research using COM-B Model and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). This included thematic analysis of focus group findings and classes delivered to 25 pregnant women (Phase 1). In Phase 2, we complemented classes with a home-based tailored behavioral intervention with a different group of 25 pregnant women. We mapped 35 TDF constructs onto survey questions. To evaluate stove use, we placed temperature sensors on wood and gas stoves and estimated fraction of stove use three times during pregnancy and twice during the first month after infant birth.


RESULTS
Class attendance rates were above 92%. We discussed feasible ways to reduce HAP exposure, proper stove use, maintenance and safety. We addressed food preferences, ease of cooking and time savings through cooking demonstrations. In Phase 2, the COM-B framework revealed that other household members needed to be involved if the gas stove was to be consistently used. Social identity and empowerment were key in decisions about stove repairs and LPG tank refills. The seven intervention functions included training, education, persuasion, incentivization, modelling, enablement and environmental restructuring. Wood stove use dropped upon introduction of the gas stove from 6.4 h to 1.9 h.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study using the COM-B Model to develop a behavioral intervention that promotes household-level sustained use of LPG stoves. This study lays the groundwork for a future LPG stove intervention trial coupled with a behavioral change intervention.

1369,"BACKGROUND
While increasing cigarette taxes has been a major policy driver to decrease smoking, taxes on other tobacco products have received less attention. Our aims were to evaluate the impact of chewing tobacco/cigar taxes, cigarette taxes, and smoke-free legislation on adolescent male and female use of smokeless tobacco and cigars.


METHODS
We analyzed data on 499,381 adolescents age 14-18 years from 36 US states in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (1999-2013) linked to state-level tobacco control policies. We conducted difference-in-differences regression models to assess whether changes in taxes and the enactment of smoke-free legislation were associated with smokeless tobacco use and, separately, cigar use. Models were stratified by adolescent sex.


RESULTS
We found that chewing tobacco taxes had no effect on smokeless tobacco use and cigar taxes had no effect on cigar use. In contrast, among males a 10% increase in cigarette taxes was associated with a 1.0 percentage point increase (0.0010, 95% CI 0.0003-0.0017) in smokeless tobacco use. A 10% increase in cigarette taxes was also associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase (0.0015, 95% CI 0.0006-0.0024) in cigar use among males and a 0.7 percentage point increase (0.0007, 95% CI 0.0001-0.0013) in cigar use among females. There was some evidence that smoke-free legislation was associated with an 1.1 percentage point increase (0.0105, 95% CI 0.0015-0.0194) in smokeless tobacco use among males only, but no effect of smoke-free legislation on cigar use for males or females.


CONCLUSIONS
Higher state cigarette taxes are associated with adolescents' use of cheaper, alternative tobacco products such as smokeless tobacco and cigars. Reducing tobacco use will require comprehensive tobacco control policies that are applied equally to and inclusive of all tobacco products.",29444658,2018,Impact of tobacco control policies on adolescent smokeless tobacco and cigar use: a difference-in-differences approach.
1370,"BACKGROUND
Many Community Health Workers (CHWs) experience the same socioeconomic and health needs as their neighbors, given that they are by definition part of their communities. Yet very few studies aim to measure and characterize experiences of deprivation, poverty, and wellbeing among community health workers. This study quantitatively examines deprivation and wellbeing in Ethiopia's Women's Development Army (WDA), a massive unpaid community health workforce intended to improve population health and modernize the country.


METHODS
We conducted a survey of 422 volunteer WDA leaders and community members in rural Amhara state, part of a mixed-methods ethnographic study of the experiences of women in the WDA. The survey asked a variety of questions about respondents' demographics, education, assets, and access to government services. We also used survey measures to evaluate respondents' levels of household food and water security, stressful life events, social support, work burden, and psychological distress.


RESULTS
Volunteer WDA leaders and community members alike tend to have very low levels of schooling and household assets, and to be heavily burdened with daily work in several domains. Large proportions are food and water insecure, many are in debt, and many experience stretches of time with no money at all. Our survey also revealed differences between volunteer WDA leaders and other women that warrant attention. Leaders are less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced or separated. Leaders are also more likely to experience some aspects of food insecurity and report greater levels of psychological distress and more stressful life events. They also report slightly less social support than other women.


CONCLUSIONS
In rural Amhara, women who seek out and/or are sought and recruited for leader roles in the WDA are a population living in precarity. In several domains, they experience even more hardship than their neighbors. These findings highlight a need for careful attention and further research into processes of volunteer CHW selection, and to determine whether or not volunteering for CHW programs increases socioeconomic and health risks among volunteers. CHW programs in settings of poverty should stop using unpaid labor and seek to create more paid CHW jobs.",29444660,2018,Volunteers in Ethiopia's women's development army are more deprived and distressed than their neighbors: cross-sectional survey data from rural Ethiopia.
1371,"BACKGROUND
Obesity during adolescence is associated with cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. The adverse obesity-related cardiometabolic risk profile is already observed in adolescence. We aimed to examine possible gender differences in cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle behaviors among adolescents with severe obesity, hypothesizing that boys would have both a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome as well as less healthy lifestyle behaviors than girls.


METHODS
Cross-sectional study of treatment-seeking adolescents with severe obesity who attended the Morbid Obesity Centre at Vestfold Hospital Trust and who were consecutively enrolled in the Vestfold Register of Obese Children between September 2009 and September 2015. A total of 313 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years were recruited, whereof 268 subjects (49% boys) completed a food and activity frequency questionnaire and were included in the analysis.


RESULTS
Mean (SD) age, BMI and BMI SDS were 15 (1.6) years, 38.6 (5.9) kg/m2 and 3.5 (0.6). Levels of LDL cholesterol, fasting insulin and glucose and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not differ between genders. Compared to girls, boys had significantly higher triglycerides (p = 0.037) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.003), as well as lower HDL cholesterol (p = 0.002). The metabolic syndrome was present in 27% of the boys and 19% of the girls (p = 0.140), and the prevalence of high DBP, dyslipidemia and dysglycemia also did not differ significantly between genders. The prevalence of high SBP was higher in boys than in girls (19% vs. 9%, p = 0.021). Gender was associated with a number of lifestyle habits, as a larger proportions of boys had higher screen time (p = 0.032), more regular breakfast eating (p = 0.023), higher intake of sugar sweetened soda (p = 0.036), and lower intake of vegetables than girls (p = 0.011). By contrast, physical activity level and intake of fruit and berries did not differ between genders.


CONCLUSIONS
Male treatment-seeking adolescents with severe obesity had a more unfavorable set of metabolic and behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease than girls. Our results indicate that lifestyle behavioral markers should be thoroughly assessed in both genders, and possible gender-related differences in risk profile should be taken into account in future treatment programs.",29444663,2018,Gender-related differences in cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle behaviors in treatment-seeking adolescents with severe obesity.
1372,"BACKGROUND
Lack of information on the HIV epidemic among men who inject drugs (MWID) in northwestern Vietnam, a remote area, may hamper national efforts to control the disease. We examined HIV prevalence, needle-syringe sharing behaviors, and associated factors among MWID in three areas of northwestern Vietnam.


METHODS
We used descriptive analysis to report the characteristics, frequency of risk behaviors, and of access to healthcare services among the MWID. Univariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between the HIV infection, needle-syringe sharing behaviors, and their independent variables. We further explored these associations in multivariable analyses where we included independent variables based on a priori knowledge and their associations with the dependent variables determined in univariable analyses (p <  0.25).


RESULTS
The HIV prevalence was 37.9, 16.9, and 18.5% for Tuan Giao, Bat Xat, and Lao Cai City, respectively, and 25.4% overall. MWID of Thai minority ethnicity were more likely to be HIV-positive (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-6.87). The rate of needle-syringe sharing in the previous 6 months was approximately 9% among the MWID in Tuan Giao and Lao Cai City, and 27.8% in Bat Xat. Two thirds of the participants never underwent HIV testing before this study. Ever having been tested for HIV before this study was not associated with any needle-syringe sharing behaviors. Among the HIV-positive MWID, those who received free clean needles and syringes were less likely to give used needles and syringes to peers (AOR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06-0.79). Going to a ""hotspot"" in the previous week was associated with increased odds of needle-syringe sharing in multiple subgroups.


CONCLUSION
Our findings on HIV prevalence and testing participation among a subset of MWID in the northwestern Vietnam were corroborated with trend analysis results from the most recent HIV/STI Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance report (data last collected in 2013.) We provided important insights into these MWID's risky injection behaviors. We suggest heightened emphasis on HIV testing and needle and syringe provision for this population. Also, policymakers and program implementers should target hotspots as a main venue to tackle HIV epidemics.",29444685,2018,Prevalence and correlates of HIV infection among men who inject drugs in a remote area of Vietnam.
1373,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, and often fatal, brain disease that causes neurodegeneration, resulting in memory loss as well as other cognitive and behavioral problems. Here, we propose a novel multimodal method combining independent components from MRI measures and clinical assessments to distinguish Alzheimer's patients or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from healthy elderly controls. 70 AD subjects (mean age: 77.15 ± 6.2 years), 98 MCI subjects (mean age: 76.91 ± 5.7 years), and 150 HC subjects (mean age: 75.69 ± 3.8 years) were analyzed. Our method includes the following steps: pre-processing, estimating the number of independent components from the MR image data, extracting effective voxels for classification, and classification using a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. As a result, with regards to classifying AD from healthy controls, we achieved a classification accuracy of 97.7%, sensitivity of 99.2%, and specificity of 96.7%; for differentiating MCI from healthy controls, we achieved a classification accuracy of 87.8%, a sensitivity of 86.0%, and a specificity of 89.6; these results are better than those obtained with clinical measurements alone (accuracy of 79.5%, sensitivity of 74.0%, and specificity of 85.1%). We found that (1) both AD patients and MCI subjects showed brain tissue loss, but the volumes of gray matter loss in MCI subjects was far less, supporting the notion that MCI is a prodromal stage of AD; and (2) combining gray matter features from MRI and three commonly used measures of mental status, cognitive function improved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared with classification using only independent components or clinical measurements.",29445429,2017,Classification of MRI and psychological testing data based on support vector machine.
1374,"Introduction
Seizures are a well-known complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and occur most commonly in the immediate posthemorrhagic period. Most commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure prophylaxis in aSAH include phenytoin and levetiracetam. There is no reliable data available on the safety and efficacy of restricting AED prophylaxis only till the aneurysm is secured.


Methods
We retrospectively chart reviewed patients admitted to our neurosciences intensive care unit (NICU) with aSAH during the past two years. Seizure incidence was studied in patients treated with phenytoin versus levetiracetam and in patients treated for 3-7 days vs. those where AED was discontinued immediately after aneurysm was secured.


Results
In 28 patients, AED prophylaxis was discontinued immediately after the aneurysm was secured, and in 21 patients, it was continued for 3-7 days. Of the 28 patients who received AED prophylaxis for less than or equal to two days, phenytoin was used in 20 patients and levetiracetam was used in eight patients. In patients receiving AED prophylaxis for 3-7 days, phenytoin was used in eight cases and levetiracetam was used in 13 cases. None of these patients had seizures reported during hospitalization or at three-month follow-up.


Conclusion
Stopping the AED prophylaxis immediately after aneurysm coiling is not associated with increased risk of seizures. Seizures at presentation in patients with aSAH are not associated with development of epilepsy at three months. Both phenytoin and levetiracetam are well tolerated in patients with aSAH when limited to the immediate posthemorrhagic period.",29445430,2017,Seizure Prophylaxis in the Immediate Post-Hemorrhagic Period in Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
1375,"Background
According to the general health policies issued in 2014, Health Impact Assessment (HIA) or Health Annex should be implemented in Iran. The present study provided a model for executing HIA in the Iranian context as a developing country.


Methods
This is a system design study with the qualitative approach. The data on the system components were gathered via reviews of the literature, in-depth interviews and focused group discussions (FGDs) with experts. The information were contently analyzed in order to draft the model and a consensus was reached on by the steering committee.


Results
Fifteen in-depth interviews and six FGD meeting were conducted. The equity-based approach in assessing the health impacts of policies, programs and projects were chosen as the most practical tool. Experts believe that for the next five years, HIA should be used just for the ""national projects"" so that the ministries and national agencies could be empowered. Components of the model including structure, procedures, and standards, management style, mission and resources were prepared. The national regulations and protocols were sent to the SCHFS Secretariat for final revision and the council approval.


Conclusion
The hasty implementation of HIA will face serious resistances as the health-oriented attitude and behavior in both government and non-governmental sectors will gradually form. Also, the overlapping of the contents of HIA with other tools such as Environmental, Cultural and Social Impact Assessments, currently used by other sectors, causes difficulties in implementing the HIA by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.",29445635,2018,Implementing Health Impact Assessment at National Level: An Experience in Iran.
1376,"All- trans-retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin A metabolite, is an important signaling molecule required for the proper development of the heart. The epicardium is the main source of RA in the embryonic heart, yet the cardiogenic functions of epicardial-produced RA are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the roles of RA signaling in the embryonic epicardium using in vivo and in vitro models of excess or deficiency of RA. Our results suggested that RA signaling facilitates the cytoskeletal rearrangement required for the epicardial-to-mesenchymal transition of epicardial cells. In vivo treatment with an inhibitor of RA synthesis delayed the migration of epicardial-derived precursor cells (EPDCs) into the myocardium; the opposite was seen in the case of dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily 3-deficient embryos, a mouse model of RA excess. Analysis of the behavior of epicardial cells exposed to RA receptor agonists or inhibitors of RA synthesis in vitro revealed that appropriate levels of RA are important in orchestrating the platelet-derived growth factor-induced loss of epithelial character, cytoskeletal remodeling, and migration, necessary for the infiltration of the myocardium by EPDCs. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which RA regulates epicardial cytoskeletal rearrangement, we used a whole transcriptome profiling approach, which in combination with pull-down and inhibition assays, demonstrated that the Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) pathway is required for the morphologic changes induced by RA in epicardial cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that RA regulates the cytoskeletal rearrangement of epicardial cells via a signaling cascade that involves the RhoA pathway.-Wang, S., Yu, J., Jones, J.

1378,"INTRODUCTION
High rates of mental health problems, such as suicidal behaviours, among First Nations youth in Canada are a major public health concern. The Good Behavior Game (GBG) is a school-based intervention that provides a nurturing environment for children and has been shown to promote positive outcomes. PAX Good Behavior Game (PAX GBG) is an adaptation and enhancement of the GBG. While PAX GBG has been implemented in Indigenous communities, little research exists examining the cultural and contextual appropriateness and effectiveness of the intervention in First Nations communities.


METHODS AND ANALYSIS
The present paper describes a protocol of the mixed-methods approach guided by an Indigenous ethical engagement model adopted to implement, adapt and evaluate PAX GBG in First Nations communities in Manitoba, Canada. First, implementation outcomes (eg, acceptability, adoption) of PAX GBG will be evaluated using qualitative interviews with teachers, principals and community members from Swampy Cree Tribal Council (SCTC) communities. Second, by linking administrative databases to programme data from schools in 38 First Nations communities, we will compare PAX GBG and control groups to evaluate whether PAX GBG is associated with improved mental health and academic outcomes. Third, the qualitative results will help inform a cultural and contextual adaptation of PAX GBG called First Nations PAX (FN PAX). Fourth, FN PAX will be implemented in a few SCTC communities and evaluated using surveys and qualitative interviews followed by the remaining communities the subsequent year.

1379,"Heterogeneity in seeds mostly occurs due to physiological, environmental and genetic factors, and
these could affect seed dormancy and germination. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the effect of
seed colour on germination behavior. For this, both light and temperature requirements were assessed in Lotus
glinoides and Lotus halophilus (Fabaceae) from the hyper-arid deserts of the United Arab Emirates. Germination
was assessed in terms of both final germination level (percentage) and germination rate, as expressed by
Timson’s germination velocity index. Lotus glinoides produces black and yellow-colored seeds, and L. halophilus
produces green and yellow seeds. Different seed lots were germinated in both light and darkness at different
temperatures. Yellow seeds of the two species attained significantly lower germination, compared to black and
green seeds. There was no specific light or temperature requirements for the germination of the two coloured
seeds of L. glinoides; the effect of interactions between seed colour and both light and incubation temperature,
were not significant on the final germination percentage. In L. halophilus, green seeds germinated significantly
more in both light and darkness at lower temperatures (15/25 °C) and in light at higher temperatures (25/35
°C), compared to yellow seeds. Yellow seeds germinated faster, compared to black at 15/25 °C in L. glinoides

information about ontogenetic development, bioenergetic growth, behaviour, taxonomic characteristics for identification
in natural environments, identification of spawning areas, and population monitoring. With the aim to
provide knowledge about their growth and behaviour, to support larval rearing, and also taxonomic purposes, we
studied the life history of the Prochilodus argenteus and P. costatus from hatching until the complete absorption
of the yolk. Larvae were obtained through artificial reproduction at the Hydrobiology and Aquaculture Station
of Três Marias, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Immediately after hatching, 100 larvae of each species were put in two
plastic incubators for conditioning. On a daily basis, larvae behavior was recorded and 14 larvae of each species
were collected to analyse body morphology. On the first day after hatching, larvae of P. costatus and P. argenteus
showed an elongated and transparent body; the yolk sac was filled with individualized yolk globules. In both
species, the embryonic fin rounded the caudal region of the body, the retina was non-pigmented and the gut was
obliterated. At the second day post-hatching, larvae of both species dendritic chromatophores had emerged, the
mouth was obliterated and the pectoral fin was observed. The larvae showed 38-43 myomeres in P. costatus and
42-43 in P. argenteus. For both species, the gas bladder was inflated and the lumen of the gut was already open.

position; the retina was pigmented; the gill arches had lamellar protrusions and were partially covered by the
operculum. On the fourth day post-hatching, the pigmentation pattern was maintained with greater intensity; the
mouth occupied a terminal position, the yolk sac was almost completely reabsorbed, and the pectoral and caudal
fins showed mesenchymal rays in both species. The gut showed a broad lumen with folded mucosa and epithelium

some biological aspects and mating behavior in Leucothyreus albopilosus. Studies were conducted at the State
University of Mato Grosso do Sul, in the municipalities of Aquidauana and Cassilândia, MS, Brazil. For biological
studies, adults were collected with light traps from February 2011 to February 2012, and for behavior
analyses from September to December 2014. Biological studies were undertaken every three days and included
the eggs inspection, and the separation of the newly hatched larvae to observe and describe their developmental
stages; to monitor larval growth and differentiate larval instars, we measured the larvae cephalic capsule. Life
cycle was determined starting from the newly laid eggs until adult death. For mating behavior studies, adults
obtained with light traps were taken to the laboratory. As soon as they started flying in the evening, couples were
formed and copulation steps were recorded. In the field, we observed that adults were mostly collected during
warmer and wetter periods (from August to March). Our results showed that the embryonic period of L. albopilosus
lasted 20.5 days, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd instars lasted 31.0, 33.1 and 85.6 days, respectively. The pupal stage
lasted 20 days, and the egg to adult period was completed in 185.5 days; these results suggest that L. albopilosus
can be characterized as a univoltine species. Observations of mating behavior in the laboratory showed that, after
the sunset, adults projected a small portion of clypeus near the soil surface and flew off seeking a female to mate.
The female could accept or reject the male for mating. When the female accepted the male, copulation occurred
from 19:00 to 23:00 hours, and lasted 19.45 minutes on average. Sometimes females refused to mate, probably
because the male or female were not sexually mature to perform copulation, and there might be a chemical
communication between the adults. Adults were observed feeding on ripe bananas (Musa sp., Musaceae) and on
mangaba flowers (Hancornia speciosa, Apocynaceae) in the laboratory. With this work we contributed with the

1382,"Human pressure on natural habitats increases the importance of agroforests for biodiversity conservation.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of cacao traditional cultivation system (CTCS) on
the conservation of the herbivorous insect community when compared with a monodominant rubber agroforest,
a type of agricultural system for cacao cultivation. The insects were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern
Bahia, Brazil: native forests, CTCS and rubber agroforests. In each habitat, 18 plots of 10 m2 were established,
and the structural measures were collected and herbivorous insects were sampled with a Malaise/window trap.
The diversity of folivorous decreased with the simplification of vegetation structure, but species composition
was similar among habitats. In addition to a decrease in the availability of resources in monodominant rubber
agroforests, the latex present in these systems have limited the occurrence of species that cannot circumvent
latex toxicity. The diversity of sap-sucking insects was similar among habitats, but species composition was
similar only in the CTCS and native forest, and it was different in the rubber agroforest. We observed turnover
and a higher frequency of individuals of the family Psyllidae in the rubber agroforest. The biology and behavior

We observed a shift in the composition of xylophagous insects in the rubber agroforest compared to that in other
habitats. Moreover, this agroforest has low species richness, but high individual abundance. Latex extraction is
likely an important additional source of volatile compounds discharged into the environment, and it increases
the attraction and recruitment of coleoborers to these sites. We concluded that CTCS has an herbivorous insect
community with a structure similar to the community found in native forests of the region, and they present a
more interesting conservation strategy when compared to rubber agroforests. We also emphasized the potential
risk of local pest outbreaks in rubber agroforests for both the rubber and associated cacao trees.",29451768,2016,Effects of habitat management on different feeding guilds of herbivorous insects in cacao agroforestry systems.
1383,"The evolution of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been one of the most exciting aspects of materials chemistry over the last 20 years. In this Account, we discuss the development during this period in our understanding of the factors that control the crystallization of MOFs from solution. Both classical porous MOFs and dense MOF phases are considered. This is an opportune time at which to examine this complex area because the experimental tools now available to interrogate crystallization processes have matured significantly in the last 5 years, particularly with the use of in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. There have also been impressive developments in the use of density functional theory (DFT) to treat not only the energies of very complex structures but also their entropies. This is particularly important in MOF frameworks because of their much greater flexibility compared with inorganic structures such as zeolites. The first section of the Account describes how early empirical observations on the crystallization of dense MOFs pointed to a strong degree of thermodynamic control, with both enthalpic and entropic factors playing important roles. For example, reactions at higher temperatures tend to lead to denser structures with higher degrees of framework connectivity and lower levels of solvation, and polymorphs tend to form according to their thermodynamic stabilities. In the case of metal tartrates, these trends have been validated by calorimetric studies. It has been clear for more than a decade, however, that certain phases crystallize under kinetic control, especially when a change in conformation of the ligand or coordination around a metal center might be necessary to form the thermodynamically preferred product. We describe how this can lead to time-dependent crystallization processes that evolve according to the Ostwald rule of stages and can be observed by in situ methods. We then consider the crystallization of porous MOFs, which presents additional challenges because of solvation effects. In spite of these problems, much has been learned about the energetics of the underlying frameworks, where the relationship between porosity and stability initially seemed to mirror the behavior of zeolites, with more porous structures being less stable. Recently, however, this simple relationship has had to be reconsidered with the emergence of some very flexible structures wherein the open structures are more stable than their denser analogues at finite temperatures because of their large vibrational entropies. In the final section we describe how the concepts developed in the MOF work have been extended into the closely related area of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. We describe recent studies on polymorphism in hybrid perovskites, which is amenable to total free energy calculations using a combination of DFT and lattice dynamics methods.",29451770,2018,Thermodynamic and Kinetic Effects in the Crystallization of Metal-Organic Frameworks.
1384,"The increasing prevalence and severity of clinical depression is strongly correlated with vascular disease risk, creating a comorbid condition with poor outcomes, although demonstrating a sexual disparity where females are at lower risk than males for subsequent cardiovascular events. To determine potential mechanisms responsible for this protection against stress/depression-induced vasculopathy in females, we exposed male and female ({plus minus}ovariectomy) rats to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model for 8 weeks and determined depressive symptom severity, vascular reactivity in aortic rings (AR) and ex vivo middle cerebral arteries (MCA), and determined the profile of major metabolites regulating vascular tone. While all groups exhibited severe depressive behaviors from UCMS, levels in females were significantly worse than in males or OVX. In all groups, endothelium-dependent dilator reactivity was depressed in AR and MCA, although myogenic activation and vascular stiffness (MCA) were not impacted. Higher resolution results from pharmacological and biochemical assays suggested that, in female rats with normal gonadal sex steroids, vasoactive metabolite profiles were better maintained than in male or OVX, despite increased depressive symptom severity (i.e., higher nitric oxide and PGI2, lower H2O2 and TxA2 bioavailability). These results suggest that female rats exhibit more severe depressive behaviors with UCMS, but are partially protected from the vasculopathy that afflicts males and females lacking normal sex hormone profiles. Determining how female sex hormones afford partial vascular protection from chronic stress and depression is a necessary step for addressing the burden that these conditions place on cardiovascular health.",29451821,2018,PROTECTION FROM VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION IN FEMALE RATS WITH CHRONIC STRESS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS.

The SCORS-G has steadily increased in popularity and this special section of the Journal of Personality Assessment reflects this growing interest. In this introduction, we provide readers with a brief overview of the 5 articles in this special section and note ways in which they reflect and build on the existing SCORS-G empirical literature. Contextualizing these articles within the broader literature allows us to highlight how the measure is employed in clinical and research settings. Each of these 5 articles also highlights areas and opportunities for future research that would address gaps in the SCORS-G literature and strengthen the utility of the measure.

1386,"Currently, 15 million informal caregivers, most of whom are women, provide care for older adults with dementia (Alzheimer's Disease Association, 2016). Caregiving for these individuals often creates distress and may adversely affect female caregivers' psychosocial and spiritual well-being. Approximately 35% of dementia caregivers complain of health deterioration after initiating caregiving responsibilities as compared to 19% of caregivers of older adults who do not have dementia (Alzheimer's Disease Association, 2016). Persons with dementia exhibit symptoms and behaviors that often are challenging for their caregivers. The way that caregivers react to these symptoms and behaviors may affect their coping repertoire and their mental health.

1387,"BACKGROUND
This study aimed to assess determinants of anthropometric measures in a nationally representative sample of Iranian children and adolescents.


METHODS
This nationwide study was conducted among 13,280 students, aged 6-18 years, who were randomly selected from 30 provinces in Iran. Anthropometric measures were determined by calibrated instruments. Demographic and socio-economic (SES) variables, lifestyle behaviors, family history of chronic disease and prenatal factors were studied, as well. A hierarchical Bayesian tri-variate analysis was used to assess the factors associated with obesity measures of the body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and wrist circumference (WrC).


RESULTS
The results showed that the BMI was associated with SES score, family history of obesity, family history of diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity, screen time, duration of sleep, breakfast consumption, birth weight, breastfeeding, junk food and place of residence (urban-rural). All these factors were also significantly associated with WrC except for consumption of junk food. Many of these factors had a partial but significant relationship with WHtR.

Various factors contribute to obesity. Preventive and educational programs on manageable factors such as increasing physical activity, eating breakfast and limiting TV or screen time could be helpful in controlling obesity in schoolchildren and reducing associated complications.",29451860,2018,A hierarchical Bayesian tri-variate analysis on factors associated with anthropometric measures in a large sample of children and adolescents: the CASPIAN-IV study.
1388,"It has been reported that both click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) have higher amplitudes in ears that possess spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs). The general aim of the present study was to investigate whether the presence of spontaneous activity in the cochlea affected tone-burst evoked otoacoustic emissions (TBOAEs). As a benchmark, the study also measured growth functions of CEOAEs. Spontaneous activity in the cochlea was measured by the level of synchronized spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SSOAEs), an emission evoked by a click but closely related to spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs, which are detectable without any stimulus). Measurements were made on a group of 15 adults whose ears were categorized as either having recordable SSOAEs or no SSOAEs. In each ear, CEOAEs and TBOAEs were registered at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, and input/output functions were measured at 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 dB SPL. Global and half-octave-band values of response level and latency were estimated. Our main finding was that in ears with spontaneous activity, TBOAEs had higher levels than in ears without. The difference was more apparent for global values, but were also seen with half-octave-band analysis. Input/output functions had similar growth rates for ears with and without SSOAEs. There were no significant differences in latencies between TBOAEs from ears with and without SSOAEs, although latencies tended to be longer for lower stimulus levels and lower stimulus frequencies. When TBOAE levels were compared to CEOAE levels, the latter showed greater differences between recordings from ears with and without SSOAEs. Although TBOAEs reflect activity from a more restricted cochlear region than CEOAEs, at all stimulus frequencies their behavior still depends on whether SSOAEs are present or not.",29451905,2018,Otoacoustic emissions from ears with spontaneous activity behave differently to those without: Stronger responses to tone bursts as well as to clicks.
1389,"BACKGROUND
Behavior change theories can identify people's main motivations to engage in recommended health practices and thus provide better tools to design interventions, particularly human centered design interventions.


OBJECTIVES
This study had two objectives: (a) to identify salient beliefs about walking three times a week for 30 minutes nonstop among patients with hypertension in a low-resource setting and, (b) to measure the relationships among intentions, attitudes, perceived social pressure and perceived behavioral control about this behavior.


METHODS
Face-to-face interviews with 34 people living with hypertension were conducted in September-October 2011 in Lima, Peru, and data analysis was performed in 2015. The Reasoned Action Approach was used to study the people's decisions to walk. We elicited people's salient beliefs and measured the theoretical constructs associated with this behavior.


RESULTS
Results pointed at salient key behavioral, normative and control beliefs. In particular, perceived behavioral control appeared as an important determinant of walking and a small set of control beliefs were identified as potential targets of health communication campaigns, including (not) having someone to walk with, having work or responsibilities, or having no time.

This theory-based study with a focus on end-users provides elements to inform the design of an intervention that would motivate people living with hypertension to walk on a regular basis in low-resource settings.",29451917,2018,Perceived behavioral control as a potential precursor of walking three times a week: Patient's perspectives.
1390,"OBJECTIVES
Every day 43 children are newly diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, almost 90% of these childhood cancer patients will survive. However, 60-90% of these survivors will experience late effects, health problems that occur months or years after treatment has ended. Late effects could occur as a result of the disease, its treatment, and patient-related factors. The two main objectives of this research are to: 1) Examine the existence of all web-based resources for childhood cancer survivors with acute lymphocytic leukemia which focus on medical and psychological aspects of late effects, and 2) Create an innovative website specifically designed to fill this void.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature review, followed by input from >20 different organizations, resulted in the creation of LEAP3 AHEAD (Late Effects Awareness for Patients, Physicians and the Public; Advancing Health and Eliminating All Disparities), a multi-dimensional website centering on late effects.


RESULTS
An extensive review revealed 14 pediatric cancer websites, none of which focused exclusively on late effects. LEAP3 AHEAD is the first interactive website for acute lympocytic leukemia childhood cancer survivors and families, as well as physicians, and the public to: a) increase awareness about risks, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of medical and psychological late effects, b) provide suggestions to successfully reintegrate into schools, careers, and socially, and c) present opportunities including camps, scholarships, and pet therapy programs.

The current study examined aged care nurses' dementia care practices in the hospital setting and developed a dementia care checklist that nurses can use to review their own care practice. A self-administered questionnaire was given to 676 participants; responses were collected from 595 participants. Exploratory factor analysis identified six factors (e.g., patient understanding prompted by concern and interest for the patient, respect for patients' voluntary behavior, early detection of abnormalities) among the questionnaire's 28 items. This analysis provided a framework for the checklist and verified that it had satisfactory internal consistency and construct validity. The frequency of care practices varied with participants' knowledge of dementia care requirements, satisfaction with their own dementia care practice, confidence in their ability to judge patients' physical condition, and cooperation with colleagues. This checklist might improve dementia care in hospital settings.

We included 41 studies that randomly assigned patients (N = 2,843) with acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or social anxiety disorder (SAD) to CBT or a psychological or pill placebo condition. Findings demonstrated moderate placebo-controlled effects of CBT on target disorder symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.56), and small to moderate effects on other anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.38), depression (Hedges' g = 0.31), and quality of life (Hedges' g = 0.30). Response rates in CBT compared to placebo were associated with an odds ratio of 2.97. Effects on the target disorder were significantly stronger for completer samples than intent-to-treat samples, and for individuals compared to group CBT in SAD and PTSD studies. Large effect sizes were found for OCD, GAD, and acute stress disorder, and small to moderate effect sizes were found for PTSD, SAD, and PD. In PTSD studies, dropout rates were greater in CBT (29.0%) compared to placebo (17.2%), but no difference in dropout was found across other disorders. Interventions primarily using exposure strategies had larger effect sizes than those using cognitive or cognitive and behavioral techniques, though this difference did not reach significance. Findings demonstrate that CBT is a moderately efficacious treatment for anxiety disorders when compared to placebo.

1394,"The study of functional morphological traits enables us to know fundamental aspects of the dynamics
of plant communities in local and global habitats. Regenerative morphological traits play an important role in
defining plant history and ecological behavior. Seed and fruit characteristics determine to a large extent the patterns
for dispersal, germination, establishment and seedling recruitment a given species exhibits on its natural
habitat. Despite their prominent role, seed and fruit traits have been poorly studied at the community level of
woody plant species in neo-tropical dry forests. In the present study we aimed at i) evaluate the functional role
of morphological traits of seeds, fruits and embryo in woody plant species; ii) determine which are the morphological
patterns present in seeds collected from the community of woody species that occur in neo-tropical
dry forests; and iii) compare woody plant species seed mass values comparatively between neo-tropical dry and
tropical forests. To do so, mature seeds were collected from 79 plant species that occur in the Tumbesian forest of
Southwest Ecuador. The studied species included the 42 and 37 most representative tree and shrubbery species of
the Tumbesian forest respectively. A total of 18 morphological traits (seven quantitative and 11 qualitative) were
measured and evaluated in the seeds, fruits and embryos of the selected species, and we compared the seeds mass
with other forest types. Our results showed a huge heterogeneity among traits values in the studied species. Seed
mass, volume and number were the traits that vary the most at the community level, i.e. seed length ranged from
1.3 to 39 mm, and seed width from 0.6 to 25 mm. Only six embryo types were found among the 79 plant species.
In 40 % of the cases, fully developed inverted embryos with large and thick cotyledons to store considerable
amount of nutrients were recorded. We concluded that highly variable and functionally complementary morphological
traits occur among the studied woody plants of the Tumbesian dry forest. The latter favors a plethora of

This bay is also subjected to numerous storms; the strongest was super typhoon Haiyan in November 8, 2013. For the first time, the seasonal dynamics of potentially toxic and harmful phytoplankton in this bay is elucidated. This is also the first record of a bloom of the cyanobacteria, Trichodesmium erythraeum that reached 70 000 colonies/L in April 2013 in this area. There were other 19 potentially toxic and harmful phytoplankton encountered during the sampling period. These consisted of a haptophyte, Phaeocystis globosa, the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia and 17 dinoflagellates. Seven of these harmful algae had densities high enough to be traced through time. Normally, diatoms abound during the dry season. But Pseudo-nitzschia increased in abundance during the wet season of 2012 and 2013. The dinoflagellates and Phaeocystis globosa behaved as expected and exhibited a relative increase in cell density during the rainy season of both years too. High nutrient availability during this season must have influenced the behavior of the phytoplankton despite differences in temperature and light intensity among seasons.

In the present study, we compared differences in brain activity during the Stroop task between patients with chronic insomnia disorder (CID) and good sleepers (GS). Furthermore, we evaluated changes in Stroop task-related brain activity after cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).


PARTICIPANTS/METHODS
The final analysis included 21 patients with CID and 25 GS. All participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing the color-word Stroop task. CBT-I, consisting of 5 sessions, was administered to 14 patients with CID in the absence of medication. After CBT-I, fMRI was repeated in the patients with CID while performing the same task. Sleep-related questionnaires and sleep variables from a sleep diary were also obtained before and after CBT-I.


RESULTS
No significant differences in behavioral performance in the Stroop task or task-related brain activation were observed between the CID and GS groups. No changes in behavioral performance or brain activity were found after CBT-I. However, clinical improvement in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score was significantly associated with changes in the Stroop task-related regional blood oxygen level-dependent signals in the left supramarginal gyrus.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that cognitive impairment in patients with CID was not detectable by the Stroop task or Stroop task-related brain activation on fMRI.

FSWs with only commercial clients were used as the comparison group (n = 308). Across all groups, the percentage of FSWs with prevalent and active syphilis ranged from 19.6% to 25.6% and 9.1% to 11.5%, respectively. Condom use was low with noncommercial sexual partners and was more likely to be used when FSWs' boyfriends had other partners.

METHODS
An experiment with a 3-group between subject design was conducted among 74 daily-smoking young adults ranging in age from 17 to 25 years old. Three conditions were tested in a mobile lab (camper vehicle) from May to December 2011, i.e., regular chart pop music (N = 28), rap/hip-hop with non-frequent references to substance use (N = 24), and rap/hip-hop with frequent references to substance use (N = 22).


RESULTS
One-way ANOVA showed that participants listening to substance use infused rap/hip-hop songs felt significantly less pleasant, liked the songs less, and comprehended the songs less compared to participants listening to pop songs. Poisson loglinear analyses revealed that compared to the pop music condition, none of the two rap/hip-hop music conditions had a significant effect on acute smoking. Thus, contrary to expectations, the two different rap/hip-hop conditions did not have a significantly different effect on acute smoking.

The hypothesized model was an adequate data fit among both groups. Among Cambodian adolescents, higher ICD levels significantly predicted increased family conflict, which in turn was associated with reduced parental involvement/monitoring, increased association with deviant peers, and a subsequently higher risk of alcohol use (p < .05 for all coefficients). We also found significant indirect effects of ICD on alcohol use among Vietnamese adolescents through family conflict and parental involvement/monitoring (p < .05 for all coefficients) but not through peer behavior. For both groups, there was no direct effect of ICD on alcohol use outside these pathways.

This cross-sectional study collected data from 406 victimized women on probation and parole between 2010 and 2012. In a multiple logistic regression model, we differentiated women who reported past-year NMUPD from those who did not using demographic, health, other drug use, substance use treatment, and trauma symptom severity variables.


RESULTS
Past-year NMUPD was reported by 26.8% (n = 109) of the overall sample. Women reporting NMUPD were significantly younger and more likely to be White.

Within the field of behavioral health research, one of the most understudied populations is the U.S. Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) population - a diverse group of individuals with hearing loss that have varied language and communication preferences, community affiliations, and sociocultural norms. Recent research identified concerning behavioral health disparities experienced by the D/HH population; yet, little research has been conducted to extend these findings to the topic of substance use disorder.


METHODS
To begin to fill this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from the 2013-2014 administration of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, comparing alcohol and drug use between participants based on their reported hearing status, i.e., D/HH or hearing.


RESULTS
Findings suggest that the overall lifetime prevalence of alcohol and drug use does not differ based on hearing status, and that D/HH and hearing adolescents begin using cannabis on a similar timeline. However, findings also revealed that D/HH respondents were more likely to have been regular cannabis users and heavy alcohol users than hearing respondents. In other words, when D/HH individuals use substances, they tend to be heavy users.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings stress the importance of directing resources to the prevention and treatment of heavy alcohol use in the D/HH population, given that binge drinking is associated with a number of health problems and social consequences. Additionally, the continuation of this empirical work is rather urgent given recent legislative changes regarding cannabis use. D/HH individuals possess a number of risk factors for substance use disorder and, as such, may be more greatly impacted by these legislative changes than individuals from the general U.S.

1405,"Estrogens exert pleiotropic effects on multiple physiological and behavioral traits including sexual behavior. These effects are classically mediated via binding to nuclear receptors and subsequent regulation of target gene transcription. Estrogens also affect neuronal activity and cell-signaling pathways via faster, membrane-initiated events. Although the distinction between appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior has been criticized, this distinction remains valuable in that it facilitates the causal analysis of certain behavioral systems. Effects of neuroestrogens produced by neuronal aromatization of testosterone on copulatory performance (consummatory aspect) and on sexual motivation (appetitive aspect) are described in male quail. The central administration of estradiol rapidly increases expression of sexual motivation, as assessed by two measures of sexual motivation produced in response to the visual presentation of a female but not sexual performance in male Japanese quail. This effect is mimicked by membrane-impermeable analogs of estradiol, indicating that it is initiated at the cell membrane. Conversely, blocking the action of estrogens or their synthesis by a single intracerebroventricular injection of estrogen receptor antagonists or aromatase inhibitors, respectively, decreases sexual motivation within minutes without affecting performance. The same steroid has thus evolved complementary mechanisms to regulate different behavioral components (motivation vs. performance) in distinct temporal domains (long- vs. short-term) so that diverse reproductive activities can be properly coordinated. Changes in preoptic aromatase activity and estradiol as well as glutamate concentrations are observed during or immediately after copulation. The interaction between these neuroendocrine/neurochemical changes and their functional significance is discussed.",29452074,2018,Differential control of appetitive and consummatory sexual behavior by neuroestrogens in male quail.
1406,"When opportunities to feed and reproduce are limited, females are often unable to recover sufficient energy stores to reproduce in consecutive years. Body condition has been used as a proxy for recent reproductive history in such species. We previously found that glucocorticoid responses to capture stress vary with body condition in female red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), a species with limited seasonal breeding opportunities. Because variation in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein in the brain could explain these differences, we first assessed GR protein content in females in different body conditions. To investigate if body condition during the spring mating season accurately reflects recent reproductive history, we measured glucocorticoid responses to stress in females with different body conditions, assessed their mating behavior and brought mated females to our lab to determine which females would give birth during the summer (i.e., were parturient). Female red-sided garter snakes reproduce biennially, and therefore mated females that did not give birth were deemed non-parturient. In this study, glucocorticoid stress responses and mating behavior did not vary with body condition, nor was body condition related to brain GR or reproductive condition (parturient vs non-parturient). Only unreceptive females showed a significant stress-induced increase in glucocorticoids, suggesting that reduced stress responsiveness is associated with receptivity. Parturient females mated faster (were more proceptive) than non-parturient females. These data suggest that HPA axis activity modulates receptivity, while proceptivity is related primarily to reproductive condition.",29452075,2018,"Physiological correlates of reproductive decisions: Relationships among body condition, reproductive status, and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in a reptile."
1407,"Nosema ceranae is an intracellular microsporidian parasite of the Asian honey bee Apis cerana and the European honey bee Apis mellifera. Until relatively recently, A. mellifera honey bees were naïve to N. ceranae infection. Symptoms of nosemosis, or Nosema disease, in the infected hosts include immunosuppression, damage to gut epithelium, nutrient and energetic stress, precocious foraging and reduced longevity of infected bees. Links remain unclear between immunosuppression, the symptoms of nutrient and energetic stress, and precocious foraging behavior of hosts. To clarify physiological connections, we inoculated newly emerged A. mellifera adult workers with N. ceranae spores, and over 21 days post inoculation (21 days pi), gauged infection intensity and quantified expression of genes representing two innate immune pathways, Toll and Imd. Additionally, we measured each host's whole-body protein, lipids, carbohydrates and quantified respirometric and activity levels. Results show sustained suppression of genes of both humorally regulated immune response pathways after 6 days pi. At 7 days pi, elevated protein levels of infected bees may reflect synthesis of antimicrobial peptides from an initial immune response, but the lack of protein gain compared with uninfected bees at 14 days pi may represent low de novo protein synthesis. Carbohydrate data do not indicate that hosts experience severe metabolic stress related to this nutrient. At 14 days pi infected honey bees show high respirometric and activity levels, and corresponding lipid loss, suggesting lipids may be used as fuel for increased metabolic demands resulting from infection. Accelerated lipid loss during nurse honey bee behavioral development can have cascading effects on downstream physiology that may lead to precocious foraging, which is a major factor driving colony collapse.",29452081,2018,Chronic Nosema ceranae infection inflicts comprehensive and persistent immunosuppression and accelerated lipid loss in host Apis mellifera honey bees.
1408,"Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic that is also used for the treatment of bipolar disorders. The objective was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of VA on a brain ischemia model. The groups of male Wistar rats were: SO (sham-operated), ischemic and ischemic treated with VA (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.). After anesthesia with ketamine and xilazine, the animals were subjected to clamping of carotid arteries (30 min) and reperfusion. Except for the carotid clamping, the SO group was submitted to the same procedure. On the 7th day, the animals were behaviorally evaluated, euthanized and had their brain dissected for neurochemical and immunohistochemical assays. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey as the post hoc test. The results showed that VA reversed partly or completely the behavioral (locomotor activity and memory deficits), neurochemical (striatal DA and DOPAC levels, brain nitrite and lipid peroxidation) and immunohistochemical alterations (iNOS, COX-2, HDAC and GSK3) observed in the untreated ischemic group. VA neuroprotective effects are probably related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as to HDAC and GSK3 inhibitory effects. These findings stimulate translational studies focusing on VA as a neuroprotective drug to be potentially used in the clinic for several neurological conditions.",29452136,2018,Neuroprotective effects of valproic acid on brain ischemia are related to its HDAC and GSK3 inhibitions.

The current study examined neural and behavioral responses to angry, happy and neutral faces in childhood social anxiety disorder (SAD).


METHOD
Behavioral (reaction time and accuracy) and electrocortical measures (P100, N170, EPN, LPP) were assessed during a facial emotion identification task in children (age 10-13) with SAD (n = 32), clinical controls with mixed anxiety disorders (n = 30), and healthy controls (n = 33).


RESULTS
Overall, there were no group differences in behavioral or neural responses to emotional faces. However, children with SAD showed an attenuated LPP to male relative to female faces, while the opposite pattern emerged in the other two groups.

The present study provides preliminary indications of gender effects in childhood SAD which should be further investigated by future studies.",29452149,2018,Facial gender but not emotion distinguishes neural responses of 10- to 13-year-old children with social anxiety disorder from healthy and clinical controls.
1410,"Ingestion of placenta by mammalian mothers can lead to changes in pain sensitivity, hormone levels, and behavioral responses to newborns. In some biparental mammals, males, in addition to females, ingest placenta when their offspring are born. In the monogamous, biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), males first become attracted to placenta when cohabitating with their pregnant mate, and virgin males administered placenta are less neophobic than males given oil vehicle. In this study, we investigated the effects of placentophagia on pain sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior, behavioral responses to pups, and circulating corticosterone levels of both breeding and nonbreeding male California mice. We orally administered either a conspecific placenta or oil vehicle to male mice from three reproductive conditions (first-time fathers, first-time expectant fathers, and virgin males) and tested their pain sensitivity 1 h later, as well as their exploratory behavior and paternal responsiveness in an open field 4 h post-treatment. We measured plasma corticosterone immediately after the open-field test. We found that placenta-treated males, independent of reproductive condition, traveled significantly longer distances in the open field than males treated with oil, indicative of lower anxiety. Additionally, fathers had shorter latencies to approach and to care for pups (i.e., huddling and licking pups), and spent more time engaging in these behaviors, than did age-matched expectant fathers and virgin males, independent of treatment. We found no effect on plasma corticosterone levels or pain sensitivity as a result of either treatment or reproductive condition. These findings indicate that placenta ingestion decreases anxiety-related behaviors in male California mice, but might not influence pain sensitivity, paternal responsiveness, or plasma corticosterone concentrations.",29452152,2018,Behavioral and endocrine consequences of placentophagia in male California mice (Peromyscus californicus).
1411,"The purpose of this work was to develop a D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) decorated nanodiamond (ND) system loading water-insoluble curcumin (ND/CUR/TPGS) to improve the colloidal dispersity and oral bioavailability of the preparation. CUR was physically loaded into ND clusters, then TPGS was coated to the ND/CUR complex forming amorphous nanostructure on the interparticle nanocage of the ND substrate. The formulation of the nanocomplexes was optimized using response surface methodology, and the optimal ND/CUR/TPGS showed small particle size (196.32 nm), high drug loading efficiency (81.59%) and core-shell structure. In vitro release study demonstrated that the nanocomplexes provided a sustained release behavior. The absorptive concentration of ND/CUR/TPGS was dramatically improved in total intestinal tract compared with CUR suspension, and the absorption was controlled by multiple transcytosis mechanisms. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that ND/CUR/TPGS had significantly higher Cmax (4.50-fold), larger AUC0-t (10.67-fold), and longer MRT0-t (3.07-fold) in contrast with that of CUR suspension. Therefore, ND/CUR/TPGS presented great potential for oral delivery of insoluble and poorly permeable drugs.",29452153,2018,Functionalization of nanodiamond with Vitamin E TPGS to facilitate oral absorption of curcumin.
1412,"BACKGROUND
Fear conditioning (FC) in rodents is the most used animal model to investigate the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although research using FC has generated a better understanding of fear memories, studies often rely on mild or moderate FC training and behavioral analysis generally focuses on measuring freezing responses within few test sessions.


NEW METHOD
We introduce the M-Maze task, a system to measures extinction of conditioned fear using suppression of operant behavior. The apparatus consists of an M-shaped maze where rats are trained to alternate nose poking at two pellet dispensers. Proximity sensors measure the animal's locomotion, as well as the latencies and number of operant behavior. Here we also describe the protracted aversive conditioning (PAC), a rat model of severe fear that induces resistant extinction following a 4-day conditioning protocol that combines delay, unpredictable, and short- and long-trace conditioning.


RESULTS
An intense one-day auditory FC protocol induced a sharp elevation in transit time and suppression of nose pokes by conditioned cues, but in contrast to what is observed in PTSD patients, fear extinction was rapidly observed. On the other hand, PAC alone or in combination with exposure to single prolonged stress induced persistent extinction impairments in M-Maze tests, as well as enhanced anxiety, and social withdrawal.


COMPARISON WITH OTHER EXISTING METHODS
The M-Maze task is fully automated and allows multiple animals to be tested simultaneously in long-term experiments. Moreover, PAC training can be an alternative approach to study extinction-resistant fear.


CONCLUSIONS
The M-Maze task allows rapid and unbiased measurements of fear-induced suppression. We suggest that long-term assessment of extinction impairments would lead to a better understanding of the neurobiology of persistent fear and the screening for new therapies.",29452180,2018,The M-Maze task: An automated method for studying fear memory in rats exposed to protracted aversive conditioning.
1413,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder. Chronic administration of corticosterone (CORT) to rodents is used to mimic the stress associated dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a well-established feature found in depressive patients. Recently, preclinical studies have demonstrated the antidepressant potential of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. So, we examined the antidepressant potential of vorinostat (VOR), a HDAC inhibitor against CORT injections in male mice. VOR (25 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) and fluoxetine (FLX) (15 mg/kg; oral) treatments were provided to CORT administered mice. At the end of dosing schedule, neurobehavioral tests were conducted; followed by mechanistic evaluation through biochemical analysis, RTPCR and western blot in serum and hippocampus. Neurobehavioral tests revealed the development of anxiety/depressive-like behavior in CORT mice as compared to the vehicle control. Depressive-mice showed concomitant HPA axis dysregulation as observed from the significant increase in serum CORT and ACTH. Chronic CORT administration was found to significantly increase hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA) and iNOS levels while lowering glutathione (GSH) content, as compared to vehicle control. VOR treatment, in a similar manner to the classical antidepressant FLX, significantly ameliorated anxiety/depressive-like behavior along with HPA axis alterations induced by CORT. The antidepressant-like ability of drug treatments against chronic CORT induced stress model, as revealed in our study, may be due to their potential to mitigate inflammatory damage and oxidative stress via modulation of hippocampal NF-κB p65, COX-2, HDAC2 and phosphorylated JNK levels.",29452193,2018,Antidepressant activity of vorinostat is associated with amelioration of oxidative stress and inflammation in a corticosterone-induced chronic stress model in mice.
1414,"A decompressive craniectomy (DC) has been shown to be a life-saving therapeutic treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, which also might result in post-operative behavioral dysfunction. However, there is still no definite conclusion about whether the behavioral dysfunction already existed at an early stage after the DC operation or is just a long-term post-operation complication. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze whether DC treatment was beneficial to behavioral function at an early stage post TBI. In this study, we established a controlled cortical impact injury rat model to evaluate the therapeutic effect of DC treatment on behavioral deficits at 1 d, 2 d, 3 d and 7 d after TBI. Our results showed that rats suffered significant behavioral and mood deficits after TBI compared to the control group, while decompressive craniectomy treatment could normalize MMP-9 expression levels and reduce hippocampal edema formation, stabilize the expression of Synapsin I, which was a potential indicator of maintaining the hippocampal synaptic function, thus counteracting behavioral but not mood decay in rats subjected to TBI. In conclusion, decompressive craniectomy, excepting for its life-saving effect, could also play a potential beneficial neuroprotective role on behavioral but not mood deficits at an early stage of moderate traumatic brain injury in rats.",29452194,2018,Decompressive craniectomy protects against hippocampal edema and behavioral deficits at an early stage of a moderately controlled cortical impact brain injury model in adult male rats.
1415,"Recovery from major depressive disorder is difficult, particularly in patients who are refractory to antidepressant treatments. To examine factors that regulate recovery, we developed a prolonged learned helplessness depression model in mice. After the induction of learned helplessness, mice were separated into groups that recovered or did not recover within 4 weeks. Comparisons were made between groups in hippocampal proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Compared with mice that recovered and control mice, non-recovered mice displaying prolonged learned helplessness had greater hippocampal activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-17A, and interleukin-23, increased permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), and lower levels of the BBB tight junction proteins occludin, ZO1, and claudin-5. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor TDZD-8 reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, increased tight junction protein levels, and reversed impaired recovery from learned helplessness, demonstrating that prolonged learned helplessness is reversible and is maintained by abnormally active GSK3. In non-recovered mice with prolonged learned helpless, stimulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors by Fingolimod or administration of the TNFα inhibitor etanercept repaired the BBB and reversed impaired recovery from prolonged learned helplessness. Thus, disrupted BBB integrity mediated in part by TNFα contributes to blocking recovery from prolonged learned helplessness depression-like behavior. Overall, this report describes a new model of prolonged depression-like behavior and demonstrates that stress-induced GSK3 activation contributes to disruption of BBB integrity mediated by inflammation, particularly TNFα, which contributes to impaired recovery from prolonged learned helplessness.",29452218,2018,TNFα disrupts blood brain barrier integrity to maintain prolonged depressive-like behavior in mice.

The aim of this research was to examine basic methodology and reporting practices in recent representative laboratory studies of human eating behavior. We examined laboratory studies of human eating behavior (N = 140 studies) published during 2016. Basic methodology (e.g., sample size, use of participant blinding) and reporting practices (e.g., information on participant characteristics) were assessed for each study. Some information relating to participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and study methodology (e.g., length of washout periods in within-subjects studies) were reported in the majority of studies. However, other aspects of study reporting, including participant eligibility criteria and how sample size was determined were frequently not reported. Studies often did not appear to standardize pre-test meal appetite or attempt to blind participants to study aims. The average sample size of studies was small (between-subjects design studies in particular) and the primary statistical analyses in a sizeable minority of studies (24%) were reliant on very small sample sizes that would be likely to produce unreliable results. There are basic methodology and reporting practices in the laboratory study of human eating behavior that are sub-optimal and this is likely to be affecting the validity and replicability of research. Recommendations to address these issues are discussed.",29452224,2018,Methodological and reporting quality in laboratory studies of human eating behavior.

Allelic distributions of DYS533 and DYS437 loci differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.05).

1418,"Our recent studies demonstrated that regional bone loss in the unloaded hind limbs of tail-suspended mice triggered pain-like behaviors due to the acidic environment in the bone induced by osteoclast activation. The aims of the present study were to examine whether TRPV1, ASIC and P2X (known as nociceptors) are expressed in bone, and whether the antagonists to those receptors affect the expression of osteoblast and osteoclast regulators, and prevent the triggering of not only pain-like behaviors but also high bone turnover conditions in tail-suspension model mice. The hind limb-unloaded mice were subjected to tail suspension with the hind limbs elevated for 14 days. The effects of the TRPV1, ASIC3, P2X2/3 antagonists on pain-like behaviors as assessed by the von Frey test, paw flick test and spontaneous pain scale; the expressions of TRPV1, ASICs, and P2X2 in the bone; and the effects of those antagonists on osteoblast and osteoclast regulators were examined. In addition, we evaluated the preventive effect of continuous treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist on the trigger for pain-like behavior and bone loss in tail-suspended mice. Pain-like behaviors were significantly improved by the treatment with TRPV1, ASIC, P2X antagonists; TRPV1, ASICs and P2X were expressed in the bone tissues; and the antagonists to these receptors down-regulated the expression of osteoblast and osteoclast regulators in tail-suspended mice. In addition, continuous treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist during tail-suspension prevented the induction of pain-like behaviors and regional bone loss in the unloaded hind limbs. We, therefore, believe that those receptor antagonists have a potential role in preventing the triggering of skeletal pain with associated regional bone metabolic disorder.",29452264,2018,"Antagonists to TRPV1, ASICs and P2X have a potential role to prevent the triggering of regional bone metabolic disorder and pain-like behavior in tail-suspended mice."
1419,"Background
Blacks experience greater multi-system physiological dysregulation, or cumulative biological risk, which is associated with poor cardiometabolic health and mortality. In this study, we assess race differences in change in risk over four years among older whites, blacks and Hispanics.


Method
We examined race differences in 4-year change in individual biomarkers and a cumulative measure of risk-cardiometabolic risk (CMR)-using data for each respondent from two waves of the Health and Retirement Study's biomarker assessment (n=5,512). CMR is a count of high-risk cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers. We estimated mean CMR at baseline and follow-up by race/ethnicity, and used logistic regression to determine whether race differences exist in 4-year transitions between high- and low-risk states for individual biomarkers.


Results
Blacks had higher baseline CMR than whites and Hispanics and experienced an increase in risk over four years; conversely, CMR decreased among whites and Hispanics. Blacks were more likely to develop high-risk pulse pressure and high-risk hemoglobin A1c, which contributed to increases in CMR. Whites and Hispanics were more likely to become low-risk on C-reactive protein and HDL cholesterol which contributed to declines in CMR. Race differences in transitions between risk states remained after controlling for social, behavioral and health care related factors. However, the racial patterning of these differences was influenced by disease diagnosis and medication use.


Conclusions
We show that the cardiometabolic health of older blacks worsens as they age both absolutely and relative to that of whites and Hispanics because of poor blood pressure control and diabetes prevention.",29452335,2018,"Change in cardiometabolic risk among blacks, whites and Hispanics: findings from the Health and Retirement Study."

1421,"This study contributes to the health policy debate on medical systems integration by describing and analysing the interactions between health-care users, indigenous healers, and the biomedical public health system, in the so far rarely documented case of post-conflict Burundi. We adopt a mixed-methods approach combining (1) data from an existing survey on access to health-care, with 6,690 individuals, and (2) original interviews and focus groups conducted in 2014 with 121 respondents, including indigenous healers, biomedical staff, and health-care users. The findings reveal pluralistic patterns of health-care seeking behaviour, which are not primarily based on economic convenience or level of education. Indigenous healers' diagnosis is shown to revolve around the concept of 'enemy' and the need for protection against it. We suggest ways in which this category may intersect with the widespread experience of trauma following the civil conflict. Finally, we find that, while biomedical staff displays ambivalent attitudes towards healers, cross-referrals occasionally take place between healers and health centres. These findings are interpreted in light of the debate on health systems integration in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we discuss policy options regarding healers' accreditation, technical training, management of cross-referrals as well as of herb-drug interactions; and we emphasise healers' psychological support role in helping communities deal with trauma. In this respect, we argue that the experience of conflict, and the experiences and conceptualizations of mental and physical illness, need to be taken into account when devising appropriate public or international health policy responses.",29452365,2018,Indigenous medicine and biomedical health care in fragile settings: insights from Burundi.
1422,"The differentiation status of neuroblastoma (NB) strongly correlates with its clinical outcomes; however, the molecular mechanisms driving maintenance of stemness and differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that plant homeodomain finger-containing protein 20 (PHF20) functions as a critical epigenetic regulator in sustaining stem cell-like phenotype of NB by using CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted knockout (KO) for high-throughput screening of gene function in NB cell differentiation. Expression of PHF20 in NB was significantly associated with high aggressiveness of the tumor and poor outcomes for NB patients. Deletion of PHF20 inhibited NB cell proliferation, invasive migration, and stem cell-like traits. Mechanistically, PHF20 interacts with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and directly binds to promoter regions of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) to modulate a histone mark associated with active transcription, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 protein subunit (H3K4me3). Overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 restored growth and progression of PHF20 KO tumor cells. Consistently, OCT4 and SOX2 protein levels in NB clinical specimens were positively correlated with PHF20 expression. Our results establish PHF20 as a key driver of NB stem cell-like properties and aggressive behaviors, with implications for prognosis and therapy.",29452418,2018,PHF20 collaborates with PARP1 to promote stemness and aggressiveness of neuroblastoma cells through activation of SOX2 and OCT4.
1423,"OBJECTIVES
The MBL2 gene is the major genetic determinant of mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-an acute phase reactant. Low MBL levels have been associated with adverse outcomes in preterm infants. The MBL2Gly54Asp missense variant causes autosomal dominant MBL deficiency. We tested the hypothesis that MBL2Gly54Asp is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes after cardiac surgery in neonates.


METHODS
This is an analysis of a previously described cohort of patients with nonsyndromic congenital heart disease who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass before age 6 months (n = 295). Four-year neurodevelopment was assessed in 3 domains: Full-Scale Intellectual Quotient, the Visual Motor Integration development test, and the Child Behavior Checklist to assess behavior problems. The Child Behavior Checklist measured total behavior problems, pervasive developmental problems, and internalizing/externalizing problems. A multivariable linear regression model, adjusting for confounders, was fit.


RESULTS
MBL2Gly54Asp was associated with a significantly increased covariate-adjusted pervasive developmental problem score (β = 3.98; P = .0025). Sensitivity analyses of the interaction between age at first surgery and MBL genotype suggested effect modification for the patients with MBL2Gly54Asp (Pinteraction = .039), with the poorest neurodevelopment outcomes occurring in children who had surgery earlier in life.


CONCLUSIONS
We report the novel finding that carriers of MBL2Gly54Asp causing autosomal dominant MBL deficiency have increased childhood pervasive developmental problems after cardiac surgery, independent of other covariates. Sensitivity analyses suggest that this effect may be larger in children who underwent surgery at earlier ages. These data support the role of nonsyndromic genetic variation in determining postsurgical neurodevelopment-related outcomes in children with congenital heart disease.",29452463,2018,Autosomal dominant mannose-binding lectin deficiency is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes after cardiac surgery in infants.

For this purpose, the magnetite nanohydrogels (MNHGs) were loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as a universal anticancer drug. The morphologies and magnetic properties of the DOX-loaded MNHGs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. The sizes and zeta potentials (ξ) of the MNHGs and their corresponding DOX-loaded nanosystems were also investigated. The DOX-loaded MNHGs showed the highest drug release values at condition of 41°C and pH 5.3. The drug-loaded MNHGs at physiological condition (pH 7.4 and 37°C) exhibited negligible drug release values. In vitro cytotoxic effects of the DOX-loaded MNHGs were extensively evaluated through the assessing survival rate of HeLa cells using the MTT assay, and their in vitro cellular uptake into the mentioned cell line were examined using fluorescent microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) flow cytometry analyses. As the results, the DOX-loaded MNHG1 exhibited higher anticancer drug delivery performance in the terms of cytotoxic effect and in vitro cellular uptake. Thus, the developed MNHG1 can be considered as a promising de novo drug delivery system, in part due to its pH and thermal responsive drug release behavior as well as proper magnetite character toward targeted drug delivery.",29452515,2018,Intelligent anticancer drug delivery performances of two poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based magnetite nanohydrogels.

The FAN Social Marketing program was developed to improve dietary and physical activity habits of families with children in Ticino, Switzerland. The aim of this study was to examine if the effects of the program on children's food intake differed by intervention group.

Effects of the FAN program were tested through a Randomized Controlled Trial. The program lasted 8 weeks, during which participants received tailored communication about nutrition and physical activity. Families were randomly allocated to one of three groups, where the parent received the intervention by the Web (G1), Web + e-mail (G2) or Web + SMS (G3). Children in all groups received tailored print letters by post. Children's food consumption was assessed at baseline and immediate post intervention using a 7-day food diary. Generalized linear mixed models with child as a random effect and with time, treatment group, and the time by treatment interaction as fixed effects were used to test the impact of the intervention.


RESULTS
Analyses were conducted with a sample of 608 children. After participating in FAN the marginal means of daily consumption of fruit changed from 0.95 to 1.12 in G1, from 0.82 to 0.94 in G2, and from 0.93 to 1.18 in G3. The margins of the daily consumption of sweets decreased in each group (1.67 to 1.56 in G1, 1.71 to 1.49 in G2, and 1.72 to 1.62 in G3). The change in vegetable consumption observed from pre to post intervention in G3 (from 1.13 to 1.21) was significantly different from that observed in G1 (from 1.21 to 1.17).


CONCLUSIONS
A well-designed Web-based Social Marketing intervention complemented with print letters can help improve children's consumption of water, fruit, soft drinks, and sweets. The use of SMS to support greater behavior change, in addition to Web-based communication, resulted only in a small significant positive change for vegetables, while the use of e-mail in addition to Web did not result in any significant difference.

1426,"Medical literature is replete with evidence regarding physical rehabilitation of the amputee; however, scant attention has been paid to psychological rehabilitation. The objective was to perform an integrative review of the published medical evidence regarding amputee peer support in the civilian population and provide an evidence-based clinical practice recommendation. This study was based on an exhaustive examination of the civilian amputee peer support medical evidence, bibliographic search, and on the experience of the authors when performing this integrative review. Our search uncovered 10 published peer-reviewed pieces of medical evidence including one level III retrospective case controlled trial, two level IV case series, and seven level V expert opinions. Given the totality of the published evidence, albeit limited, in favor of amputee peer support, an abundance of unpublished anecdotal evidence, virtually no potential risk of harm, and low cost, it seems reasonable to recommend incorporating a preoperative and/or postoperative peer visit in clinical protocols for all patients incurring a major limb amputation.",29452628,2018,An integrative review of peer support for patients undergoing major limb amputation.
1427,"Follicular lymphoma is a clinical disease with a multitude of presentations and behaviors. Although infrequent, transformation of follicular lymphoma to a more aggressive behaving subtype - prototypically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma - confers a substantially adverse prognosis. There is no consensus for optimal management after transformation is recognized. Historically considered a distinct clinical event, this review highlights the multiple subclinical transformational events that either variably or cumulatively result in clinical recognition of transformed follicular lymphoma. Known and suspected events include genetic and epigenetic perturbations, metabolomic changes, and alterations in the microenvironment. This diverse spectrum of pathways leads to heterogeneous clinical presentations and outcomes of transformed follicular lymphoma. Current options for prevention of transformation are limited to known strategies of managing follicular lymphoma before the transformation is recognized. Although most retrospectively analyzed studies suggest an association of lower transformation rates with early systemic therapy, specific components of therapy such as anti-CD20 antibodies, anthracyclines, or purine analogues are less strongly associated with ""preventative' value. Thus, the goal of preventing transformation is of limited value among all factors that go into decisions on early management of follicular lymphoma. Future opportunities to prevent clinical evidence of transformation will benefit from early detection of markers of subclinical transformation and development of therapies to specifically target the biology implied by those markers.",29452666,2018,Transformation of follicular lymphoma - Why does it happen and can it be prevented?
1428,"SMZL is a relatively rare low grade B-cell lymphoma, characterized usually by an indolent clinical behavior. Since there is no prospective randomized trials to establish the best treatment approach, decision on therapeutic management should be based on the available retrospective series. Based on these data, rituximab and splenectomy appear to be the most effective. Splenectomy represented the standard treatment modality until early 2000s. More than 90% of the patients present quick amelioration of splenomegaly related symptoms along with improvement of cytopenias related to hypersplenism. The median progression free survival was 8.25 years in the largest series of patients published so far, while the median 5- and 10- year OS were 84% and 67%, respectively. Responses to splenectomy are not complete since extrasplenic disease persists. Patients with heavy bone marrow infiltration, lymphadenopathy or other disease localization besides the spleen are not good candidates for splenectomy. Furthermore splenectomy is a major surgical procedure accompanied by acute perioperative complications as well as late toxicities mainly due to infections. For that reasons splenectomy is not appropriate for elderly patients or patients with comorbidities with a high surgical risk. On the other hand rituximab monotherapy displays high efficacy with minimal toxicity. Several published series have shown an ORR more than 90%, with high CR rates (∼50%). The 10-year PFS and OS were 63% and 85%, respectively in a series of 104 SMZL patients. The role of rituximab maintenance has been investigated by only one group. Based on these data, maintenance with rituximab further improved the quality of responses by increasing significantly the CR rates (from 42% at the end of induction to 71% at the end of maintenance treatment), as well as the duration of responses: 7-year PFS was 75% for those patients who received maintenance vs 39% for those who did not (p < 0.0004). However no difference in OS has been noticed between the two groups, so far. Summarizing the above data, it is obvious that Rituximab monotherapy is associated with high response rates, long response duration and favorable safety profile, rendering it as the treatment of choice in SMZL.",29452668,2018,Should rituximab replace splenectomy in the management of splenic marginal zone lymphoma?
1429,"BACKGROUND
Although subthalamic stimulation is a recognised treatment for motor complications in Parkinson's disease, reports on behavioural outcomes are controversial, which represents a major challenge when counselling candidates for subthalamic stimulation. We aimed to assess changes in behaviour in patients with Parkinson's disease receiving combined treatment with subthalamic stimulation and medical therapy over a 2-year follow-up period as compared with the behavioural evolution under medical therapy alone.


METHODS
We did a parallel, open-label study (EARLYSTIM) at 17 surgical centres in France (n=8) and Germany (n=9). We recruited patients with Parkinson's disease who were disabled by early motor complications. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to either medical therapy alone or bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. The primary outcome was mean change in quality of life from baseline to 2 years. A secondary analysis was also done to assess behavioural outcomes. We used the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease to assess changes in behaviour between baseline and 2-year follow-up. Apathy was also measured using the Starkstein Apathy Scale, and depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory. The secondary analysis was done in all patients recruited. We used a generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression model for individual items and mixed model regression for subscores of the Ardouin scale and the apathy and depression scales. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00354133. The primary analysis has been reported elsewhere; this report presents the secondary analysis only.


FINDINGS
Between July, 2006, and November, 2009, 251 participants were recruited, of whom 127 were allocated medical therapy alone and 124 were assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. At 2-year follow-up, the levodopa-equivalent dose was reduced by 39% (-363·3 mg/day [SE 41·8]) in individuals allocated bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy and was increased by 21% (245·8 mg/day [40·4]) in those assigned medical therapy alone (p<0·0001). Neuropsychiatric fluctuations decreased with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy during 2-year follow-up (mean change -0·65 points [SE 0·15]) and did not change with medical therapy alone (-0·02 points [0·15]); the between-group difference in change from baseline was significant (p=0·0028). At 2 years, the Ardouin scale subscore for hyperdopaminergic behavioural disorders had decreased with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy (mean change -1·26 points [SE 0·35]) and had increased with medical therapy alone (1·12 points [0·35]); the between-group difference was significant (p<0·0001). Mean change from baseline at 2 years in the Ardouin scale subscore for hypodopaminergic behavioural disorders, the Starkstein Apathy Scale score, and the Beck Depression Inventory score did not differ between treatment groups. Antidepressants were stopped in 12 patients assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy versus four patients allocated medical therapy alone. Neuroleptics were started in nine patients assigned medical therapy alone versus one patient allocated bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. During the 2-year follow-up, two individuals assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy and one patient allocated medical therapy alone died by suicide.


INTERPRETATION
In a large cohort with Parkinson's disease and early motor complications, better overall behavioural outcomes were noted with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone. The presence of hyperdopaminergic behaviours and neuropsychiatric fluctuations can be judged additional arguments in favour of subthalamic stimulation if surgery is considered for disabling motor complications.

1431,"The aim of this study was to investigate if a machine learning algorithm utilizing triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data from an inertial motion unit (IMU) could detect surface- and age-related differences in walking. Seventeen older (71.5 ± 4.2 years) and eighteen young (27.0 ± 4.7 years) healthy adults walked over flat and uneven brick surfaces wearing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) over the L5 vertebra. IMU data were binned into smaller data segments using 4-s sliding windows with 1-s step lengths. Ninety percent of the data were used as training inputs and the remaining ten percent were saved for testing. A deep learning network with long short-term memory units was used for training (fully supervised), prediction, and implementation. Four models were trained using the following inputs: all nine channels from every sensor in the IMU (fully trained model), accelerometer signals alone, gyroscope signals alone, and magnetometer signals alone. The fully trained models for surface and age outperformed all other models (area under the receiver operator curve, AUC = 0.97 and 0.96, respectively; p ≤ .045). The fully trained models for surface and age had high accuracy (96.3, 94.7%), precision (96.4, 95.2%), recall (96.3, 94.7%), and f1-score (96.3, 94.6%). These results demonstrate that processing the signals of a single IMU device with machine-learning algorithms enables the detection of surface conditions and age-group status from an individual's walking behavior which, with further learning, may be utilized to facilitate identifying and intervening on fall risk.",29452755,2018,Machine learning algorithms based on signals from a single wearable inertial sensor can detect surface- and age-related differences in walking.
1432,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
Insulinoma is a rare pancreatic tumor and, usually, a benign disease but can be a malignant one and, sometimes, a highly aggressive disease. The aim of this study was to determine differences between benign and malignant tumors.


METHODS
Retrospective study of 103 patients with insulinoma treated in a tertiary center. It was analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory, localization and histologic analysis of tumor and follow up data of subjects in order to identify differences between individuals benign and malignant disease.


RESULTS
Almost all patients (87%) had a benign tumor and survival rates of 100% following pancreatic tumor surgery. Those with malignant tumors (13%) have a poor prognosis, 77% insulinoma-related deaths over a period of 1-300 months after the diagnosis with a survival rate of 24% in five years. The following factors are associated with an increased risk of malignant disease: duration of symptoms < 24 months, fasting time for the occurrence of hypoglycemia < 8 h, blood plasma insulin concentration ≥ 28 μU/mL and C-peptide ≥ 4.0 ng/mL at the glycemic nadir and tumor size ≥ 2.5 cm.


CONCLUSIONS

1433,"Understanding iodine concentration, transport, and bioavailability is essential in evaluating iodine's impact to the environment and its effectiveness as an environmental biogeotracer. While iodine and its radionuclides have proven to be important tracers in geologic and biologic studies, little is known about transport of this element to the deep sea and subsequent uptake in deep-sea coral habitats. Results presented here on deep-sea black coral iodine speciation and iodine isotope variability provides key information on iodine behavior in natural and anthropogenic environments, and its geochemical pathway in the Gulf of Mexico. Organo-iodine is the dominant iodine species in the black corals, demonstrating that binding of iodine to organic matter plays an important role in the transport and transfer of iodine to the deep-sea corals. The identification of growth bands captured in high-resolution scanning electron images (SEM) with synchronous peaks in iodine variability suggest that riverine delivery of terrestrial-derived organo-iodine is the most plausible explanation to account for annual periodicity in the deep-sea coral geochemistry. Whereas previous studies have suggested the presence of annual growth rings in deep-sea corals, this present study provides a mechanism to explain the formation of annual growth bands. Furthermore, deep-sea coral ages based on iodine peak counts agree well with those ages derived from radiocarbon (14C) measurements. These results hold promise for developing chronologies independent of 14C dating, which is an essential component in constraining reservoir ages and using radiocarbon as a tracer of ocean circulation. Furthermore, the presence of enriched 129I/127I ratios during the most recent period of skeleton growth is linked to nuclear weapons testing during the 1960s. The sensitivity of the coral skeleton to record changes in surface water 129I composition provides further evidence that iodine composition and isotope variability captured in proteinaceous deep-sea corals is a promising geochronometer as well as an emerging tracer for continental material flux.",29452767,2018,Uptake and distribution of organo-iodine in deep-sea corals.

METHODS
Medline (via PubMed), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus were screened through to February 21, 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of yoga on menopausal symptoms to those of no treatment or active comparators. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.


RESULTS
Thirteen RCTs with 1306 participants were included. Compared with no treatment, yoga reduced total menopausal symptoms (SMD=-1.05; 95% CI -1.57 to -0.53), psychological (SMD=-0.75; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.34), somatic (SMD=-0.65; 95% CI -1.05 to -0.25), vasomotor (SMD=-0.76; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.25), and urogenital symptoms (SMD=-0.53; 95% CI -0.81 to -0.25). Compared with exercise controls, only an effect on vasomotor symptoms was found (SMD=-0.45; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04).

This study sought to identify the issues influencing pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women's intentions to perform MSA with a view to informing future interventions for these populations. Mixed methods guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) were used to explore factors that influence women's intentions to perform MSA. In stage one, 34 women participated in either a focus group or interview. Discussions were transcribed verbatim and analysed based on menopausal status using a deductive approach. In stage two, 186 women (M = 47 years, SD = 9) completed a questionnaire to assess participant demographics, levels of MSA, affective and instrumental attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, regression analyses and analysis of variances. Behavioural beliefs were: improved muscular health; psychological benefits; improved body shape. Normative beliefs were: health professionals; family members; work colleagues. Control beliefs were: equipment; motivation; time constraints; knowledge; physical capability; fear of judgement. However, these beliefs were not well established. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of intentions (spc2 = 0.11) followed by affective attitudes (spc2 = 0.09), with no significant differences on TPB variables between groups.

1438,"BACKGROUND
The ability to appropriately integrate and respond to rewarding and aversive stimuli is essential for survival. The ventral pallidum (VP) plays a critical role in processing both rewarding and aversive stimuli. However, the VP is a heterogeneous structure, and how VP subpopulations integrate into larger reward networks to ultimately modulate these behaviors is not known. We identify a noncanonical population of glutamatergic VP neurons that play a unique role in responding to aversive stimuli and constraining inappropriate reward seeking.


METHODS
Using neurochemical, genetic, and electrophysiology approaches, we characterized glutamatergic VP neurons (n = 4-8 mice/group). We performed patch clamp and in vivo electrophysiology recordings in the lateral habenula, rostromedial tegmental nucleus, and ventral tegmental area to determine the effect of glutamatergic VP neuron activation in these target regions (n = 6-10 mice/group). Finally, we selectively optogenetically stimulated glutamatergic VP neurons in a real-time place preference task and ablated these neurons using a virally expressed caspase to determine their necessity for reward seeking.


RESULTS
Glutamatergic VP neurons exhibit little overlap with cholinergic or gamma-aminobutyric acidergic markers, the canonical VP subtypes, and exhibit distinct membrane properties. Glutamatergic VP neurons innervate and increase firing activity of the lateral habenula, rostromedial tegmental nucleus, and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic ventral tegmental area neurons. While nonselective optogenetic stimulation of the VP induced a robust place preference, selective activation of glutamatergic VP neurons induced a place avoidance. Viral ablation of glutamatergic VP neurons increased reward responding and abolished taste aversion to sucrose.


CONCLUSIONS
Glutamatergic VP neurons constitute a noncanonical subpopulation of VP neurons.

1440,"INTRODUCTION
Research has shown that African Americans gain more than average weight after smoking cessation. However, African Americans have been underrepresented in post-cessation weight gain research. The current study examined 1) the pattern of weight gain and 2) the association between smoking status and weight gain in a sample of African Americans seeking smoking cessation treatment.


METHODS
Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a 4-week culturally specific smoking cessation cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention among African American smokers (N = 342). Weight was measured and self-reported smoking status was biochemically verified at baseline, end of counseling, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Random effects multilevel modeling was used to examine weight gain over twelve months post CBT, and a fully unconditional model tested the pattern of weight gain over time. Smoking status was included as a time-varying factor to examine its effect on weight gain, controlling for potential confounding variables.


RESULTS
Weight significantly increased among those who remained abstinent over 12 months post CBT [average gain of seven lbs. (three kg)]. Controlling for covariates, abstinence was predictive of the rate of weight gain for those with high weight concern.


CONCLUSIONS
Weight gain among African American abstainers was comparable to the average post-cessation weight gain observed among the general population. It is possible that exposure to CBT (culturally specific or standard) may have mitigated excessive weight gain. Future research should assess predictors of weight gain in African American smokers to inform future smoking cessation interventions and help elucidate factors that contribute to tobacco- and obesity-related health disparities.",29452980,2018,Association between smoking cessation and weight gain in treatment-seeking African Americans.
1441,"BACKGROUND
People with disabilities experience mental health disparities and higher rates of violence compared to people without disabilities. Few studies have examined the psychological consequences of violence against people with disabilities, and whether they differ from those experienced by people without disabilities.


OBJECTIVE
This study compared psychological consequences of violence among men and women with and without disabilities.


METHODS
We analyzed data from the 2008-2014 waves of the National Crime Victimization Survey. Multiple logistic regressions were estimated to compare the psychological impact of violent crime on respondents without disabilities to those with disabilities, who comprised roughly 20% of the sample (n = 8,070). We stratified by gender to compare the effects of violence experienced by men and women.


RESULTS
Men with disabilities were more likely than men without disabilities to report severe distress (AOR = 2.07, p < 0.001), anxiety (1.79, p < 0.001), depression (2.32, p < 0.001), and anxiety and depression (2.34; p < 0.001), but were less likely to experience each outcome compared to women with disabilities. Men with disabilities had similar odds of adverse psychological outcomes compared to women without disabilities. Women with disabilities had higher odds of severe distress following violence compared to men without disabilities (3.90, p < 0.001) or women without disabilities (1.86, p < 0.001). Similarly, women with disabilities had higher odds of anxiety, depression, and anxiety and depression compared to men and women without disabilities.

1443,"BACKGROUND
Both, maternal borderline personality disorder (BPD) and maternal major depressive disorder (MDD) are often associated with adverse consequences for children, including increased risk for child behavior problems. Reduced maternal emotional availability might play a critical role in transmitting maternal psychopathology on the child. Our aim was to investigate the association between emotional availability and maternal BPD and MDD in remission (rMDD), and if this interrelatedness mediates the association between maternal mental disorders and child behavior problems.


METHODS
The interaction of 178 mother-child dyads was assessed during a play situation using the Emotional Availability Scales. Children were between 5 and 12 years old. Regression analyses were used to investigate the impact of maternal BPD and maternal rMDD on emotional availability. Ordinary least squares regression analyses using bootstrapping were conducted to investigate the mediating effect of emotional availability on the association between maternal mental disorders and child behavior problems.


RESULTS
Mothers with BPD showed increased hostility during mother-child interaction, whereas history of MDD was associated with reduced sensitivity. Maternal hostility was a mediator between maternal BPD and number of child psychiatric disorders, as well as externalizing and internalizing behavior. Maternal sensitivity mediated the association between maternal rMDD and number of child psychiatric disorders, as well as internalizing child behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest that mothers with BPD show a qualitatively different pattern of emotional availability compared to mothers with rMDD. These patterns might reflect two separate pathways of transgenerational transmission of aspects of maternal mental disorders, where intervention and training programs could start: maternal rMDD impacts on child behavior problems via reduced sensitivity, and maternal BPD via increased hostility, which could both be addressed with specific therapeutic interventions.",29453011,2018,Emotional availability in mothers with borderline personality disorder and mothers with remitted major depression is differently associated with psychopathology among school-aged children.

Given these findings, research has begun to evaluate the features of this multi-faceted behavior that may be most important to assess when quantifying risk for SI, SP, and SA. However, no studies have examined the wide range of NSSI characteristics simultaneously when determining which NSSI features are most salient to suicide risk. The current study utilized three exploratory data mining techniques (elastic net regression, decision trees, random forests) to address these gaps in the literature. Undergraduates with a history of NSSI (N = 359) were administered measures assessing demographic variables, depression, and 58 NSSI characteristics (e.g., methods, frequency, functions, locations, scarring) as well as current SI, current SP, and SA history. Results suggested that depressive symptoms and the anti-suicide function of NSSI were the most important features for predicting SI and SP.

1445,"The capability to enact lethal self-harm has recently been highlighted as a critical risk factor for suicidal behavior. Klonsky and May's (2015) three step theory of suicide (3ST) expanded upon the construct of the capability for suicide by dividing it into categories: dispositional, acquired, and practical. The current study examined constructs of Patrick and colleagues' (2009) triarchic model of psychopathy as indicators of dispositional capability in gun owners, a sample at heightened risk for death by suicide (Anestis and Houtsma, 2017). We anticipated that specific psychopathic traits would exhibit robust associations with other components of the capability for suicide. In a sample of 300 gun-owning adults, Boldness was uniquely related to all indicators of practical capability in both male and female gun owners, and a Boldness*Meanness interaction predicted the highest levels of some capability components. These results are consistent with theoretical conceptualizations of the triarchic model. Our findings indicate that, among US gun owners, dispositional factors may impact comfort with and aptitude with guns, which may enhance our understanding of which gun owners are at the greatest risk of gun suicide should they develop suicidal thoughts.",29453038,2018,Psychopathic personality traits as a form of dispositional capability for suicide.
1446,"Among people with suicide ideation most do not attempt suicide or die by suicide. In this online study of adult US Facebook users (n = 219), we examined capability for suicide, operationalized as fearlessness about death, and tolerance for psychological pain as potential variables that may explain why some people move from suicide ideation to suicidal behavior. Tolerance for psychological pain was significantly higher for participants who had never attempted suicide. Fearlessness about death was higher in participants who had attempted suicide, but not significantly. At high levels of psychological pain, one's belief in the ability to cope with psychological pain, a dimension of tolerance for psychological pain, was lower in participants with a history of suicide attempt than in participants who had never attempted suicide. The odds of suicidal desire were almost cut in half with each unit increase in participants' belief in their coping ability, whereas for each unit increase in fearlessness about death, the odds of suicidal desire increased by 65%. The Pearson correlation between tolerance for psychological pain and fearlessness about death was negligible. Our findings support a role for both tolerance for psychological pain and capability for suicide/fearlessness about death in the ideation-to-action framework of suicide.",29453039,2018,Tolerance for psychological pain and capability for suicide: Contributions to suicidal ideation and behavior.
1447,"The major goal of cancer chemotherapy is to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs, while minimizing their associated side effects. Celastrol (CST), which is extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii, has been reported to exhibit significant anticancer effects in various in vitro and in vivo cancer models. Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems could be employed to preserve and enhance the pharmacological effects of CST in cancer cells. Among these, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are one of the most promising drug delivery systems. MSNs possess the capability of passive accumulation within solid tumors, and could efficiently transport anticancer drugs to such tumors in a site-specific manner. In this study, PEGylated polyaminoacid-capped CST-loaded MSN (CMSN-PEG) showed controlled in vitro drug release behavior, and exhibited high in vitro cytotoxicity in different cancer cells. Compared to treatment with free CST, treatment with CMSN-PEG resulted in the increased expression of the apoptosis protein HIF-1α and proteins corresponding to mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Importantly, CMSN-PEG remarkably reduced tumor burden with no toxicity to healthy cells in the SCC7 tumor-bearing xenograft model. Our results clearly demonstrate a promising potential of CMSN-PEG for the treatment of solid tumors.",29453086,2018,PEGylated polyaminoacid-capped mesoporous silica nanoparticles for mitochondria-targeted delivery of celastrol in solid tumors.
1448,"PURPOSE
Levetiracetam is a broad-spectrum anti-epileptic drug that is effective against both focal and generalized epilepsies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of levetiracetam monotherapy in the management of different seizure types in children with epilepsy under the age of two.


METHOD
This retrospective study was conducted on children with a diagnosis of epilepsy from January 2014 to January 2017. To be included in the study, patients were required to be less than two years of age at the time levetiracetam was initiated as initial monotherapy and to be followed clinically for at least 6 months.


RESULTS
Of the 92 patients, 61 (66%) patients were seizure free. Fifty-eight percent of the patients (31 of 53) with focal epilepsy were seizure free and 77% (30 of 39) generalized epilepsy were seizure free. We found that levetiracetam monotherapy was effective in both focal and generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam monotherapy was significantly more effective in patients with unknown etiologies (p = 0.004). Seizure freedom rate under levetiracetam monotherapy was significantly higher in patients with normal psychomotor development (p = 0.000). Seizure freedom rate under levetiracetam monotherapy was significantly higher in patients with unknown etiologies and normal psychomotor development. Normal psychomotor development was the strongest predictor of seizure control under levetiracetam monotherapy (OR = 6; 95% CI = 2.3-16.0; p < 0.001). Five children (1%) reported irritability. No hematological or biochemical, or behavioral adverse side effects except irritability were reported in any children. No patient discontinued levetiracetam therapy because of treatment-related side effects.


CONCLUSION
Our study showed levetiracetam to be an effective, well tolerated and safe agent for the treatment of a variety of seizure types and etiologies seen in infants.",29453114,2018,Levetiracetam monotherapy for the treatment of infants with epilepsy.
1449,"BACKGROUND
Cancer Care Ontario's Screening Activity Report (SAR) is an online audit and feedback tool designed to help primary care physicians in Ontario, Canada, identify patients who are overdue for cancer screening or have abnormal results requiring follow-up. Use of the SAR is associated with increased screening rates. To encourage SAR use, Cancer Care Ontario sends monthly emails to registered primary care physicians announcing that updated data are available. However, analytics reveal that 50% of email recipients do not open the email and less than 7% click the embedded link to log in to their report.


OBJECTIVE
The goal of the study is to determine whether rewritten emails result in increased log-ins. This manuscript describes how different user- and theory-informed messages intended to improve the impact of the monthly emails will be experimentally tested and how a process evaluation will explore why and how any effects observed were (or were not) achieved.


METHODS
A user-centered approach was used to rewrite the content of the monthly email, including messages operationalizing 3 behavior change techniques: anticipated regret, material incentive (behavior), and problem solving. A pragmatic, 2x2x2 factorial experiment within a multiphase optimization strategy will test the redesigned emails with an embedded qualitative process evaluation to understand how and why the emails may or may not have worked. Trial outcomes will be ascertained using routinely collected administrative data. Physicians will be recruited for semistructured interviews using convenience and snowball sampling.


RESULTS
As of April 2017, 5576 primary care physicians across the province of Ontario, Canada, had voluntarily registered for the SAR, and in so doing, signed up to receive the monthly email updates. From May to August 2017 participants received the redesigned monthly emails with content specific to their allocated experimental condition prompting use of the SAR. We have not yet begun analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
This study will inform how to communicate effectively with primary care providers by email and identify which behavior change techniques tested are most effective at encouraging engagement with an audit and feedback report.

1450,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Developmental-behavioral conditions are common, affecting ∼15% of US children. The prevalence and complexity of these conditions are increasing despite long wait times and a limited pipeline of new providers. We surveyed a convenience sample of the developmental-behavioral pediatric (DBP) workforce to determine current practices, workforce trends, and future needs.


METHODS
An electronic survey was e-mailed to 1568 members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics and Council on Children with Disabilities, the Society for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners Developmental and Behavioral Mental Health Special Interest Group.


RESULTS
The response rate was 48%. There were 411 fellowship-trained physicians, 147 nonfellowship-trained physicians, and 125 nurse practitioners; 61% were women, 79% were white, and 5% were Hispanic. Physicians had a mean of 29 years since medical school graduation, and one-third planned to retire in 3 to 5 years. Nurse practitioners were earlier in their careers. Respondents reported long wait times for new appointments, clinician burnout, increased patient complexity and up to 50% additional time spent per visit in nonreimbursed clinical-care activities. Female subspecialists spent more time per visit in billable and nonbillable components of clinical care.


CONCLUSIONS
The DBP workforce struggles to meet current service demands, with long waits for appointments, increased complexity, and high volumes of nonreimbursed care. Sex-based practice differences must be considered in future planning. The viability of the DBP subspecialty requires strategies to maintain and expand the workforce, improve clinical efficiency, and prevent burnout.",29453235,2018,A Workforce Survey on Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics.
1451,"OBJECTIVE
To examine clinicopathologic correlations in early vs late age at onset frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).


METHODS
All patients were clinically evaluated and prospectively diagnosed at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center. Two consecutive series were included: (1) patients with a clinically diagnosed FTD syndrome who underwent autopsy (cohort 1) and (2) patients with a primary pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, regardless of the clinical syndrome (cohort 2). These series were divided by age at symptom onset (cutoff 65 years).


RESULTS
In cohort 1, 48 (25.3%) were 65 years or older at symptom onset. Pathologic causes of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) were similar in the early age at onset (EO) and late age at onset (LO) bvFTD groups. In corticobasal syndrome (CBS), however, the most common pathologic substrate differed according to age at onset: progressive supranuclear palsy (42.9%) in LO-CBS and Alzheimer disease (AD; 40.7%) in EO-CBS. In cohort 2, 57 (28.4%) were classified as LO-FTLD. Regarding FTLD major molecular classes, FTLD with transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa was most common in EO-FTLD (44.4%), whereas FTLD-tau (58.3%) was most common in LO-FTLD. Antemortem diagnosis of a non-FTD syndrome, usually AD-type dementia, was more frequent in LO-FTLD than EO-FTLD (19.3% vs 7.7%, p = 0.017). LO-FTLD was also associated with more prevalent comorbid pathologic changes. Of these, moderate to severe AD neuropathologic change and argyrophilic grain disease were overrepresented among patients who received an antemortem diagnosis of AD-type dementia.


CONCLUSION
Patients with FTD and FTLD often develop symptoms after age 65, and age at onset represents an important consideration when making antemortem neuropathologic predictions.",29453245,2018,Early vs late age at onset frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
1452,"OBJECTIVE
To identify the white matter correlates of apathy and impulsivity in the major syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, using diffusion-weighted imaging and data from the PiPPIN (Pick's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: Prevalence and Incidence) study. We included behavioral and language variants of frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy.


METHODS
Seventy patients and 30 controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging at 3-tesla after detailed assessment of apathy and impulsivity. We used tract-based spatial statistics of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, correlating with 8 orthogonal dimensions of apathy and impulsivity derived from a principal component analysis of neuropsychological, behavioral, and questionnaire measures.


RESULTS
Three components were associated with significant white matter tract abnormalities. Carer-rated change in everyday skills, self-care, and motivation correlated with widespread changes in dorsal frontoparietal and corticospinal tracts, while carer observations of impulsive-apathetic and challenging behaviors revealed disruption in ventral frontotemporal tracts. Objective neuropsychological tests of cognitive control, reflection impulsivity, and reward responsiveness were associated with focal changes in the right frontal lobe and presupplementary motor area. These changes were observed across clinical diagnostic groups, and were not restricted to the disorders for which diagnostic criteria include apathy and impulsivity.


CONCLUSION
The current study provides evidence of distinct structural network changes in white matter associated with different neurobehavioral components of apathy and impulsivity across the diverse spectrum of syndromes and pathologies associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.",29453244,2018,White matter change with apathy and impulsivity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes.
1453,"Keeping track of individual cell identifications is imperative to the study of dynamic single cell behavior over time. Highly motile hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) migrate quickly and do not adhere, and thus must be imaged very frequently to keep cell identifications. Even worse, they are also flushed away during medium exchange. To overcome these limitations, we tested antibody coating for reducing HSPC motility in vitro. Anti-CD43 and -CD44 antibody coating reduced cell motility of mouse and human HSPCs in a concentration dependent manner. This enables 2D colony formation without cell mixing in liquid cultures, massively increases time-lapse imaging throughput, and maintains cell positions also during media exchange. Anti-CD43, but not -CD44 coating reduces mouse HSPC proliferation with increasing concentrations. No relevant effects on cell survival or myeloid and megakaryocyte differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors 1-5 (MPPs) were detected. Human umbilical cord hematopoietic CD34+ cell survival, proliferation and differentiation was not affected by either coating. This approach both, massively simplifies and accelerates continuous analysis of suspension cells, and enables the study of their behavior in dynamic rather than static culture conditions over time.",29453290,2018,Mouse and human HSPC immobilization in liquid culture by CD43 or CD44-antibody coating.
1454,"OBJECTIVES
The impact of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms on the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncertain. We aimed to address this in a longitudinal study of secondary care patients.


METHODS
Longitudinal disease activity was defined by disease flare, escalation of medical therapy, hospitalization, or intestinal resection. The number of investigations performed and clinics attended determined healthcare utilization. Psychological well-being and quality of life were assessed using validated questionnaires. These outcomes were compared over a minimum period of 2 years between patients reporting IBS-type symptoms and patients with quiescent disease, occult inflammation, and active disease at baseline.


RESULTS
In 360 IBD patients, there were no differences in longitudinal disease activity between patients with IBS-type symptoms and patients with quiescent disease or occult inflammation. Disease flare and escalation of medical therapy was more common in patients with active disease than in patients with IBS-type symptoms (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-5.19 and HR = 3.24; 95% CI 1.98-5.31, respectively). A greater number of investigations were performed in patients with IBS-type symptoms than quiescent disease (P = 0.008), but not compared with patients with occult inflammation or active disease. Anxiety, depression, and somatization scores at follow up were higher, and quality-of-life scores lower, in patients with IBS-type symptoms when compared with patients with quiescent disease, but were similar to patients with active disease.


CONCLUSIONS
IBS-type symptoms in IBD were associated with increased healthcare utilization, psychological comorbidity, reduced quality of life, but not adverse disease activity outcomes during extended follow-up.",29453384,2018,"Longitudinal impact of IBS-type symptoms on disease activity, healthcare utilization, psychological health, and quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease."
1455,"The relief from an aversive event is rewarding. Since organisms are able to learn which environmental cues can cease an aversive event, relief learning helps to better cope with future aversive events. Literature data suggest that relief learning is affected in various psychopathological conditions, such as anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system in relief learning. Using a relief learning procedure in Sprague Dawley rats, we applied a combination of behavioral experiments with anatomical tracing, c-Fos immunohistochemistry, and local chemogenetic and pharmacological interventions to broadly characterize the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The present study shows that a specific part of the mesolimbic dopamine system, the projection from the posterior medial ventral tegmental area (pmVTA) to the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), is activated by aversive electric stimuli. 6-OHDA lesions of the pmVTA blocked relief learning but fear learning and safety learning were not affected. Chemogenetic silencing of the pmVTA-AcbSh projection using the DREADD approach, as well as intra-AcbSh injections of the dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist raclopride inhibited relief learning. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that the dopaminergic pmVTA-AcbSh projection is critical for relief learning but not for similar learning phenomena. This novel finding may have clinical implications since the processing of signals predicting relief and safety is often impaired in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Furthermore, it may help to better understand psychological conditions like non-suicidal self-injury, which are associated with pain offset relief.",29453443,2018,Role of the mesolimbic dopamine system in relief learning.
1456,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disruptions in three core behavioral domains: deficits in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior or thought. There are currently no drugs available for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD and drugs that target comorbid symptoms often have serious adverse side effects, suggesting an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The neurobiology of autism is complex, but converging evidence suggests that ASD involves disruptions in the inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmitter system. Specifically, people with autism have a reduction in parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons in the PFC, leading to the suggestion that restoring interneuron function in this region may be a novel therapeutic approach for ASD. Here we used a dual-reporter embryonic stem cell line to generate enriched populations of PV-positive interneurons, which were transplanted into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the Poly I:C rodent model of autism. PV interneuron transplants were able to decrease pyramidal cell firing in the mPFC and alleviated deficits in social interaction and cognitive flexibility. Our results suggest that restoring PV interneuron function in the mPFC may be a novel and effective treatment strategy to reduce the core symptoms of autism.",29453447,2018,Embryonic stem cell transplants as a therapeutic strategy in a rodent model of autism.
1457,"Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in many psychiatric diseases. In humans, a lack of 5-HT2B receptors is associated with serotonin-dependent phenotypes, including impulsivity and suicidality. A lack of 5-HT2B receptors in mice eliminates the effects of molecules that directly target serotonergic neurons including amphetamine derivative serotonin releasers, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT2B receptors directly and positively regulate raphe serotonin neuron activity. By ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we report that stimulation by the 5-HT2B receptor agonist, BW723C86, increased the firing frequency of serotonin Pet1-positive neurons. Viral overexpression of 5-HT2B receptors in these neurons increased their excitability. Furthermore, in vivo 5-HT2B-receptor stimulation by BW723C86 counteracted 5-HT1A autoreceptor-dependent reduction in firing rate and hypothermic response in wild-type mice. By a conditional genetic ablation that eliminates 5-HT2B receptor expression specifically and exclusively from Pet1-positive serotonin neurons (Htr2b 5-HTKO mice), we demonstrated that behavioral and sensitizing effects of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine), as well as acute behavioral and chronic neurogenic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine, require 5-HT2B receptor expression in serotonergic neurons. In Htr2b 5-HTKO mice, dorsal raphe serotonin neurons displayed a lower firing frequency compared to control Htr2b lox/lox mice as assessed by in vivo extracellular recordings and a stronger hypothermic effect of 5-HT1A-autoreceptor stimulation was observed. The increase in head-twitch response to DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) further confirmed the lower serotonergic tone resulting from the absence of 5-HT2B receptors in serotonin neurons. Together, these observations indicate that the 5-HT2B receptor acts as a direct positive modulator of serotonin Pet1-positive neurons in an opposite way as the known 5-HT1A-negative autoreceptor.",29453444,2018,Positive regulation of raphe serotonin neurons by serotonin 2B receptors.

One example of this is being able to rapidly and accurately detect a wide range of pathogenic organisms, both in the clinic and the field.

1459,"Subretinal prostheses are designed to restore sight in patients blinded by retinal degeneration using electrical stimulation of the inner retinal neurons. To relate retinal output to perception, we studied behavioral thresholds in blind rats with photovoltaic subretinal prostheses stimulated by full-field pulsed illumination at 20 Hz, and measured retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses to similar stimuli ex-vivo. Behaviorally, rats exhibited startling response to changes in brightness, with an average contrast threshold of 12%, which could not be explained by changes in the average RGC spiking rate. However, RGCs exhibited millisecond-scale variations in spike timing, even when the average rate did not change significantly. At 12% temporal contrast, changes in firing patterns of prosthetic response were as significant as with 2.3% contrast steps in visible light stimulation of healthy retinas. This suggests that millisecond-scale changes in spiking patterns define perceptual thresholds of prosthetic vision. Response to the last pulse in the stimulation burst lasted longer than the steady-state response during the burst. This may be interpreted as an excitatory OFF response to prosthetic stimulation, and can explain behavioral response to decrease in illumination. Contrast enhancement of images prior to delivery to subretinal prosthesis can partially compensate for reduced contrast sensitivity of prosthetic vision.",29453455,2018,Temporal structure in spiking patterns of ganglion cells defines perceptual thresholds in rodents with subretinal prosthesis.
1460,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
Ghrelin, a stomach-derived hormone implicated in numerous behaviors including feeding, reward, stress, and addictive behaviors, acts by binding to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Here, we present the development, verification, and initial characterization of a novel GHSR knockout (KO) Wistar rat model created with CRISPR genome editing.


METHODS
Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed a GHSR KO in a Wistar background. Loss of GHSR mRNA expression was histologically verified using RNAscope in wild-type (WT; n = 2) and KO (n = 2) rats. We tested the effects of intraperitoneal acyl-ghrelin administration on food consumption and plasma growth hormone (GH) concentrations in WT (n = 8) and KO (n = 8) rats. We also analyzed locomotion, food consumption, and body fat composition in these animals. Body weight was monitored from early development to adulthood.


RESULTS
The RNAscope analysis revealed an abundance of GHSR mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus in WTs, and no observed probe binding in KOs. Ghrelin administration increased plasma GH levels (p = 0.0067) and food consumption (p = 0.0448) in WT rats but not KOs. KO rats consumed less food overall at basal conditions and weighed significantly less compared with WTs throughout development (p = 0.0001). Compared with WTs, KOs presented higher concentrations of brown adipose tissue (BAT; p = 0.0322).


CONCLUSIONS
We have verified GHSR deletion in our KO model using histological, physiological, neuroendocrinological, and behavioral measures. Our findings indicate that GHSR deletion in rats is not only associated with a lack of response to ghrelin, but also associated with decreases in daily food consumption and body growth, and increases in BAT. This GHSR KO Wistar rat model provides a novel tool for studying the role of the ghrelin system in obesity and in a wide range of medical and neuropsychiatric disorders.",29453460,2018,Development and initial characterization of a novel ghrelin receptor CRISPR/Cas9 knockout wistar rat model.
1461,"The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a major proliferative agent in the nervous system. Both BDNF-deficiency and perinatal hypoxia represent genetic/environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. Moreover, a decreased BDNF response to birth hypoxia was associated with the disease. BDNF expression is influenced by neuronal activity and environmental conditions such as hypoxia. Thus, it may partake in neuroprotective and reparative mechanisms in acute or chronic neuronal insults. However, the interaction of hypoxia and BDNF is insufficiently understood and the behavioral outcome unknown. Therefore, we conducted a battery of behavioral tests in a classical model of chronic early postnatal mild hypoxia (10% O2), known to significantly impair brain development, in BDNF-deficient mice. We found selective deficits in measures associated with sensorimotor gating, namely enhanced acoustic startle response (ASR) and reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) of ASR in BDNF-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, the alterations of sensorimotor gating were caused only by BDNF-deficiency alone, whereas hypoxia failed to evoke severe deficits and even leads to a milder phenotype in BDNF-deficient mice. As deficits in sensorimotor gating are present in schizophrenia and animal models of the disease, our results are of relevance regarding the involvement of BDNF in its pathogenesis. On the other hand, they suggest that the effect of perinatal hypoxia on long-term brain abnormalities is complex, ranging from protective to deleterious actions, and may critically depend on the degree of hypoxia. Therefore, future studies may refine existing hypoxia protocols to better understand neurodevelopmental consequences associated with schizophrenia.",29453493,2018,Altered prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response in BDNF-deficient mice in a model of early postnatal hypoxia: implications for schizophrenia.
1462,"We evaluated the effectiveness of the Parenting Wisely (PW) program 6 months post intervention and assessed differences based on delivery format. Using a quasi-experimental design, parents (N = 311) participated in the PW program in one of five formats (i.e., parents-only intensive workshop, parents-only 5-week group, parents and adolescents 5-week group, parent and adolescent online, and parent-only online format). An additional 53 parents served as a comparison group. We used the McMaster Family Assessment Device, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Violent Behavior Checklist to measure family functioning, parenting, and adolescent behavior. Relative to the comparison group, at 6 month follow-up parents who participated in PW reported increases in confidence in their parenting skills, decreases in conflicts with their adolescents, and decreases in adolescent externalizing and violent behavior. Mechanisms of change analyses supported the conceptual model that program effects were related to child behavior changes by influencing positive parenting and decreasing negative family dynamics. PW effectiveness did not vary substantially by delivery format, except for the intensive workshop format, which was less effective than other formats. These findings extend research on PW to include evidence of sustained program effects on adolescent externalizing and violent behaviors in an ethnically diverse, socioeconomically disadvantaged sample.

1464,"This manuscript is an outgrowth of an invited panel presentation at the national Association for Psychologists in Academic Health Centers Conference in 2017 on Interprofessional Education (IPE). IPE is a structured and transformative educational strategy designed to provide active learning experiences where trainees from diverse healthcare professions gain shared content knowledge plus collaboration skills as they learn about, from, and with each other. Collaboration skills include understanding professional role distinctions and overlap, effective team-based communication, shared values/ethics and respect for each other's expertise, and teamwork dynamics. It is increasingly important to expand training beyond the intraprofessional activities in which psychology trainees engage to prepare them to participate in interprofessional collaborative care. As healthcare systems move to team-based collaborative practice and value-based reimbursement models, the profession of psychology needs leaders at every academic health center to facilitate the design and/or implementation of IPE activities. The panel of psychologists presented roles that psychologists play in IPE institutional program design and implementation, graduate training programs, and the perspectives of an early career psychologist and psychology trainee. Opportunities and challenges are highlighted, culminating in a call to action. Psychologists must embrace their identity as health professionals and engage their learners in IPE so that the emerging cognitive schemata of healthcare that is developed includes the profession of psychology. Otherwise, healthcare teams and health professionals will not understand the value, roles, or potential contributions of psychologists in enhancing patient care outcomes, ultimately jeopardizing psychologists' referrals, involvement in healthcare delivery, and career opportunities.",29453507,2018,Interprofessional Education: Opportunities and Challenges for Psychology.
1465,"Recent World Health Organization HIV treatment guideline expansion may facilitate timely antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. However, large-scale success of universal treatment strategies requires a more comprehensive understanding of known barriers to early ART initiation. This work aims to advance a more comprehensive understanding of interrelationships among three known barriers to ART initiation: psychological distress, HIV-related stigma, and low social support. We analyzed cross-sectional interview data on 1175 adults initiating ART at six HIV treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Experience of each form of HIV-related stigma assessed (e.g., anticipatory, internalized, and enacted) was associated with increased odds of psychological distress. However, among those who reported enacted HIV-related stigma, there was no significant association between social support and psychological distress. Interventions to improve mental health among people living with HIV should consider incorporating components to address stigma, focusing on strategies to prevent or reduce the internalization of stigma, given the magnitude of the relationship between high internalized stigma and psychological distress. Interventions to increase social support may be insufficient to improve the mental health of people living with HIV who experienced enacted HIV-related stigma. Future research should examine alternative strategies to manage the mental health consequences of enacted HIV-related stigma, including coping skills training.",29453552,2018,"HIV-Related Stigma, Social Support, and Psychological Distress Among Individuals Initiating ART in Ethiopia."
1466,"High rates of both problem and pathological gambling (PPG) and substance-use disorders (SUDs) have been reported in schizophrenia, and yet PPG frequently goes undetected in clinical practice and unexamined in research. Here, we aimed to examine the relationship between PPG and SUDs in a large sample of patients across several factors related to both gambling and substance use, including poly-substance use. Additionally, delay discounting is a form of impulsivity known to positively associate with both PPG and SUDs and thought to underlie mechanisms of addiction in both contexts. We aimed to investigate the relationship between PPG and delay discounting in schizophrenia. 337 individuals with schizophrenia completed structured face-to-face interviews regarding gambling behaviors, substance use, and delay discounting. PPG in schizophrenia was associated with substance use, in particular with poly-substance use, and with delay discounting among males. Factors related to substance use were strongly linked with gambling in this sample, but not always with PPG more than recreational gambling. Our findings overall support the notions that multiple forms of gambling in schizophrenia are clinically relevant, that gambling may share common substrates with substance use, and that delay discounting represents a potential mechanism of this association in males.",29453588,2018,Problem and Pathological Gambling in Schizophrenia: Exploring Links with Substance Use and Impulsivity.

Variants in the leptin receptor gene have potential associations with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We aimed to investigate association of rs1137101 (A/G) polymorphism at LEPR gene with risk of RCC and patients survival. 123 individuals were classified into group I: 73 RCC patients and group II: 50 healthy controls. Genotyping of the Gln223Arg (A/G) polymorphism rs1137101 at LEPR gene was analyzed using allelic discrimination assay by Real-Time PCR technique. GG genotype was the most frequent among RCC patients (67.1%), while AA genotype was the most frequent in controls (60%); (p < 0.001). By univariate cox regression: gene polymorphism (GG versus GA +AA), stage, histopathologic subtype, and grade were found to affect survival significantly; however, the multivariate analysis showed that only gene polymorphism (GG versus GA +AA) and tumor stage significantly affect survival. LEPR gene variants rs1137101 might be a candidate risk factor for RCC in Egypt. GG genotype is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and shorter survival compared with GA & AA genotypes so, genotyping of Gln223Arg (A/G) rs1137101 could also predict RCC outcome.",29453609,2018,Leptin receptor gene (A/G) polymorphism rs1137101 and renal cell carcinoma.
1468,"PURPOSE
Although non-pharmacological interventions have been shown to improve physical functioning in individuals with osteoarthritis (OA), the mechanisms by which this occurs are often unclear. This study assessed whether changes in arthritis self-efficacy, perceived pain control, and pain catastrophizing mediated changes in physical functioning following an osteoarthritis intervention involving weight management, physical activity, and cognitive-behavioral pain management.


METHOD
Three hundred Veteran patients of 30 primary care providers with knee and/or hip OA were cluster randomized to an OA intervention group or usual care. The OA intervention included a 12-month phone-based patient behavioral protocol (weight management, physical activity, and cognitive-behavioral pain management) plus patient-specific OA treatment recommendations delivered to primary care providers.


RESULTS
Using linear mixed models adjusted for provider clustering, we observed that baseline to 6-month changes in arthritis self-efficacy and pain control partially mediated baseline to 12-month physical functioning improvements for the intervention group; catastrophizing did not.


CONCLUSION
Findings of a mediating role of arthritis self-efficacy and pain control in intervention-related functional changes are consistent with hypotheses and align with theoretical assertions of the role of cognitions in cognitive and behavioral interventions for chronic pain. However, contrary to hypotheses, catastrophizing was not found to be a mediator of these changes.",29453622,2018,Cognitive Mediators of Change in Physical Functioning in Response to a Multifaceted Intervention for Managing Osteoarthritis.
1469,"Individuals higher in dispositional mindfulness, a quality of non-judgmental attention to the present moment, fare better than their less mindful counterparts on a wide range of psychological and interpersonal outcomes. However, remarkably little is known about the potential influence of dispositional mindfulness on sexual outcomes. Here we investigated whether dispositional mindfulness was associated with a range of sexual outcomes, including sexual satisfaction, sexual hyperactivation (heightened sexual desire and worry), sexual deactivation (suppression of sexual desire and behavior), and problematic pornography use. We also tested whether capacity for emotion regulation was the mechanism underlying the mindfulness-sexual outcome association. These hypotheses were tested in two samples: a sample of adults in a committed romantic relationship (N = 407) and a group of adults who were long-term single (N = 400). Across both samples, dispositional mindfulness predicted more adaptive sexual outcomes, and emotion regulation generally mediated these associations. Of particular importance, the positive effects of dispositional mindfulness on sexual outcomes appear to generalize across relationship statuses, with both partnered and long-term single individuals displaying a similar pattern of results. These findings highlight that high dispositional mindfulness may predict a range of positive sexual outcomes in both partnered and single individuals.",29453643,2018,The Effects of Mindfulness on Sexual Outcomes: The Role of Emotion Regulation.
1470,"Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics were investigated in two mountainous streams with closed-type sabo dams. Surface water was collected from four stations along the two mountainous streams and analyzed using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and excitation-emission fluorescence matrix (EEM) methods. Optical properties of DOM indicated an increase in molecular weight and aromaticity at stations near the sabo dams. Average spectral ratio values were low before and after the dam (i.e., < 0.72) compared to other sections of the stream. Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254) increased in the vicinities of the dams. While chromophoric DOM characteristics from two sites were influenced by the dam, fluorescence components, however, did not show notable changes around dams. Instead, the three chromophoric components distinguished by EEM-parallel factor analysis, that is, humic-like (C1 and C2) and protein-like (C3) increase along the stream. Fulvic-like component (C1) had a high fluorescence intensity at all stations; all the three components were more abundant in the downstream section. Chromophoric DOM properties varied along the stream based on alterations in molecular size and aromaticity. Using multivariate analysis, the studied sites were grouped into three clusters related to sabo dams and other activities. We conclude that sabo dams modify DOM characteristics which influence the behavior of DOM transported along the stream.",29453667,2018,Dissolved organic matter characteristics along sabo dammed streams based on ultraviolet visible and fluorescence spectral properties.
1471,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Antipsychotic medication use has steadily increased in Canada, with an expansion in the profile of users and the diagnoses for which they are used. The use of antipsychotics is associated with a number of adverse effects for which routine monitoring is recommended. The objectives of this study were to determine the most common diagnoses associated with antipsychotic use in children in Alberta, Canada and the proportion who receive recommended laboratory tests for adverse effects.


METHODS
Data on dispensed antipsychotics, diagnoses, prescribers, and laboratory testing were obtained from provincial data sources. To assess the frequency of metabolic and hormonal laboratory baseline and/or follow-up testing, the sample was divided into an antipsychotic-naïve cohort and an antipsychotic non-naïve cohort.


RESULTS
In 2014, 6916 children were dispensed at least one second- or third-generation antipsychotic. The most frequently dispensed antipsychotics were risperidone (3908 children), quetiapine (2140 children), and aripiprazole (1302 children). The majority of children prescribed risperidone were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorder. Quetiapine was mainly prescribed for neurotic disorder or depression, while aripiprazole was prescribed most frequently for conduct disorder or neurotic disorders. Among antipsychotic-naïve patients, 17% had at least one laboratory test done at baseline, and 35% had at least one laboratory test done at follow-up. In the non-naïve patients, 42% had at least one follow-up laboratory test. Lipid and glucose testing were done in less than 5% of the naïve cohort at baseline, and in less than 15% at follow-up. In the non-naïve cohort, less than 22% received lipid or glucose testing during the year 2014.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of antipsychotic use in children in Alberta is off-label and associated with disruptive behavior disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders. The vast majority of children prescribed antipsychotic medications do not undergo recommended laboratory tests.",29453686,2018,"Antipsychotic Prescribing and Safety Monitoring Practices in Children and Youth: A Population-Based Study in Alberta, Canada."
1472,"A conceptual and computational framework is proposed for modelling of human sensorimotor control and is exemplified for the sensorimotor task of steering a car. The framework emphasises control intermittency and extends on existing models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically observed corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows straightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing one-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological psychology traditions. Empirical data from a driving simulator are used in model-fitting analyses to test some of the framework's main theoretical predictions: it is shown that human steering control, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better described as a sequence of discrete stepwise control adjustments, than as continuous control. Results on the possible roles of sensory prediction in control adjustment amplitudes, and of evidence accumulation mechanisms in control onset timing, show trends that match the theoretical predictions; these warrant further investigation. The results for the accumulation-based model align with other recent literature, in a possibly converging case against the type of threshold mechanisms that are often assumed in existing models of intermittent control.",29453689,2018,Sustained sensorimotor control as intermittent decisions about prediction errors: computational framework and application to ground vehicle steering.

We examined Mullen Scales of Early Learning, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, and early ASD symptoms between 8 and 36 months in high-risk siblings (HR; n = 161) and low-risk controls (LR; n = 71). Longitudinally, LR and HR-Typical showed higher developmental level and functioning, and fewer ASD symptoms than HR-Atypical and HR-ASD. At 8 months, machine learning classified HR-ASD at chance level, and broader atypical development with 69.2% Area Under the Curve (AUC).

1474,"Female gender, contraceptives, and menopausal hormone replacement treatments containing progesterone analogues associate with higher risk of meningiomas yet with lower risk of gliomas. Progesterone receptor (PR) expression and mifepristone treatment was highly discussed for meningiomas. However, much less is known in regard to progesterone actions in gliomas despite PR expression strongly correlates with their grade. Meningiomas and gliomas may grow faster during gestation; but paradoxically, parousity reduces lifetime risk of gliomas which can be explained with dichotomous cell growth-stimulating and inhibitory actions of progesterone at low versus high levels. Progesterone levels gradually increase in gestation up to 200-fold and the incidence of highly angiogenic brain tumors decreases in the last trimester. Indeed, progesterone stimulates glial tumor cell growth at low doses (10 nM) while induces cell kill at higher doses. During gestation, some immune pathways are activated to protect the mother and the fetus against microbial pathogens. In parallel, high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) used in treatment of endometrial carcinoma decreases tumoral expression of PR-B and increases infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. MPA also synergies with IL-2 in clinical treatment of renal cancer. In both glioma and meningioma, the dominant cytosolic PR is PR-B which increases cell growth, while PR-A limits cell growth. This seems also paradoxical at the first glance due to opposite behavior of these tumors in diverse endocrine conditions. High-dose progestins may inhibit brain tumor growth by downregulating PR-B, yet the dosage thresholds may differ between glial and meningeal tumors due to higher total PR expression in meningiomas. Supporting this proposal, certain progestins were reported to stimulate meningioma growth in anecdotal reports, but same agents at much higher doses reduced meningioma cell proliferation in pilot clinical studies. PR antagonist mifepristone reduced meningioma growth in some clinical studies, but lacked efficacy in others. In fact, mifepristone also has partial PR agonist efficacy and acts in synergy with MPA to block EC growth. Hence, a similar mechanism of receptor downregulation may also account for mifepristone. Both MPA and mifepristone also harbor myeloprotective features against chemotherapy. Ulipristal is another contraceptive PR antagonist and exerts promising anticancer activity on drug-resistant ovarian cancer and BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells, which can be tested in animal glioblastoma models. We propose that progestins strongly deserve to be investigated in experimental models of glioblastoma alone and in combination with immunostimulating agents.",29453736,2018,Reproductive epidemiology of glial tumors may reveal novel treatments: high-dose progestins or progesterone antagonists as endocrino-immune modifiers against glioma.

This cross-sectional study aimed to compare desire for social distance from people with mental illness in the disciplines of social work and psychology, and among students and professionals having different professional experience.


METHODS
948 respondents (715 students and 233 professionals) from Lithuanian educational and mental health-care institutions participated in an anonymous survey. Social distance was measured using Lithuanian Social Distance Scale which was created for this study. Participants also answered questions about familiarity with mental illness. Bias of social desirability was measured using the balanced inventory of desirable responding.


RESULTS
Series of ANCOVA analysis revealed that psychology and social work master's and PhD students reported less social distance from people with mental illness when compared with bachelor's students. Familiarity with mental illness was significantly related to less social distance in the student sample, but not in professionals' sample. The strongest desire for social distance in the professionals' sample was observed in social workers having less than 5 years of professional practice and most experienced psychologists with more than 10 years of professional practice.

1477,"Schiff-base compounds have many applications in the field of optoelectronic materials and chemical sensing because of their appealing coordination ability, and simple and easily accessible use in structural modification. Herein, five kinds of star-shaped Schiff-base compounds were designed and their optical response behavior to hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas was studied using dependent/time-dependent density functional theory (DFT/TDDFT). Moreover, the relationship between structures and properties was investigated upon changing the benzene group into N atom or triazine group at the core-position and introducing a methoxyl (-OCH3) or nitro (-NO2) group into the star-shaped Schiff-bases at the tail of the branches. The results show that all five Schiff-bases could be candidates for HCl gas sensing materials. Furthermore, introducing an electron-donating group at either the core or the tail forms a charge transfer channel with the electron deficient H-bonded imino group, which is convenient for charge transfer and subsequently promotes a red-shift in absorption spectra and fluorescence quenching.",29453758,2018,Theoretical study on the optical response behavior to hydrogen chloride gas of a series of Schiff-base-based star-shaped structures.
1478,"This study examines the spontaneous use of embodied egocentric transformation (EET) in understanding false beliefs in the minds of others. EET involves the participants mentally transforming or rotating themselves into the orientation of an agent when trying to adopt his or her visuospatial perspective. We argue that psychological perspective taking such as false belief reasoning may also involve EET because of what has been widely reported in the embodied cognition literature, showing that our processing of abstract, propositional information is often grounded in concrete bodily sensations which are not apparently linked to higher cognition. In Experiment 1, an agent placed a ball into one of two boxes and left. The ball then rolled out and moved either into the other box (new box) or back into the original one (old box). The participants were to decide from which box they themselves or the agent would try to recover the ball. Results showed that false belief performance was affected by increased orientation disparity between the participants and the agent, suggesting involvement of embodied transformation. In Experiment 2, false belief was similarly induced and the participants were to decide if the agent would try to recover the ball in one specific box. Orientation disparity was again found to affect false belief performance. The present results extend previous findings on EET in visuospatial perspective taking and suggest that false belief reasoning, which is a kind of psychological perspective taking, can also involve embodied rotation, consistent with the embodied cognition view.",29453768,2018,Mental Rotation in False Belief Understanding.
1479,"Allopregnanolone (5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one) and its synthetic 3β-methyl analog, ganaxolone, are positive allosteric modulators of synaptic and extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors that exhibit antiseizure activity in diverse animal seizure models, including models of status epilepticus (SE). The 2 neuroactive steroids are being investigated as treatments for SE, including as a treatment for SE induced by chemical threat agents. Intramuscular injection is the preferred route of administration in the prehospital treatment of SE. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of intramuscular allopregnanolone and ganaxolone in the treatment of SE induced by the chemical threat agent tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS). The test agents were administered 40 minutes after the onset of SE when mice are refractory to treatment. Allopregnanolone and ganaxolone (each at 3 mg/kg) terminated SE in, respectively, 92% and 75% of animals, and prevented mortality in 85% and 50% of animals; the mean times to termination of behavioral seizures were, respectively, 172 ± 16 and 447 ± 52 seconds. In a separate series of experiments, mice were dosed with the neuroactive steroids by intramuscular injection, and plasma and brain levels were sampled at various time points following injection to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma Cmax (maximum concentration) values for allopregnanolone and ganaxolone were 645 and 550 ng/mL, respectively. Brain exposure of both steroids was approximately 3-fold the plasma exposure. Two-compartment pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the central compartment Vd (volume of distribution), CL (clearance), t½ (terminal half-life), and F (intramuscular bioavailability) values for allopregnanolone and ganaxolone were, respectively, 4.95 L/kg 12.88 L/kg/h,16 minutes, 97%, and 5.07 L/kg, 8.35 L/kg/h, 25 minutes, 95%. Allopregnanolone and ganaxolone are effective in the treatment of TETS-induced SE when administered by the intramuscular route. Allopregnanolone is more rapidly acting and modestly more effective, possibly because it has greater potency on GABAA receptors.",29453777,2018,Intramuscular allopregnanolone and ganaxolone in a mouse model of treatment-resistant status epilepticus.

Male adult Flinders Sensitive Line rats (model of depression, FSL; n = 22) received Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 (109 or 1010 colony-forming units/d) or vehicle for 10 weeks. The controls, Flinders Resistant Line rats (FRL, n = 8), only received vehicle. C1-related metabolites were measured in plasma, urine, and different tissues. Monoamine concentrations were measured in plasma, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Vehicle-treated FSL rats had higher plasma concentrations of betaine, choline, and dimethylglycine, but lower plasma homocysteine and liver S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) than FRLs. FSL rats receiving high-dose probiotics had lower plasma betaine and higher liver SAM compared to vehicle-treated FSL rats. FSLs had higher concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin than FRLs across various brain regions. Probiotics decreased plasma dopamine in FSLs in a dose-dependent manner. There were no detectable changes in liver function markers or behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
Probiotics reduced the flow of methyl groups via betaine, increased liver SAM, and decreased plasma dopamine and norepinephrine.

1482,"Klinefelter syndrome is a frequent cause of hypogonadism, but despite hundreds of publications on different aspects of Klinefelter syndrome, only a few studies dealt with sexual dysfunction. In particular, testosterone is critical for various aspects of sexual response, but its role on sexuality in Klinefelter syndrome patients is debatable and no studies have evaluated the efficacy of testosterone treatment on sexual dysfunction in these subjects. Furthermore, the impact of psychological and relational aspects on sexual function of Klinefelter syndrome subjects is poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to determine the presence and type of sexual dysfunctions in Klinefelter syndrome subjects; to correlate them with testosterone levels and psychosexological and relational domains; and to evaluate the effects of testosterone therapy. We studied 62 non-mosaic naïve Klinefelter syndrome patients and 60 age-matched controls by means of medical history, psychosexological history, 15-item International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire, endocrine assessment, and dynamic penile color Doppler ultrasound. Twenty-five hypogonadal Klinefelter syndrome patients were studied after 6 months of testosterone replacement therapy. Klinefelter syndrome subjects have reduced 15-item International Index of Erectile Function scores regarding sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction with respect to controls, and these aspects were significantly associated with testosterone levels. Klinefelter syndrome subjects had also higher prevalence of erectile dysfunction, but no relation with testosterone levels was evident. A high prevalence of a range of psychological disturbances was present in Klinefelter syndrome subjects with erectile dysfunction with respect to those without erectile dysfunction. No statistical difference in the prevalence of premature and delayed ejaculation was observed between Klinefelter syndrome and control subjects. Testosterone replacement therapy improved sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction scores, but had no effect on erectile function. Penile color Doppler ultrasound was normal in all subjects. This study shows that sexual dysfunction in Klinefelter syndrome is multifactorial and related only in part to hypogonadism and largely to psychological disturbances.

1483,"Different applications of synthetic biology are alike in that their possible negative consequences are highly uncertain, potentially catastrophic, and perhaps irreversible; therefore, they are also alike in that public attitudes about them are fertile ground for behavioral economic phenomena. Findings from behavioral economics suggest that people may not respond to such applications according to the normal rules of economic evaluation, by which the value of an outcome is multiplied by the mathematical probability that the outcome will occur. Possibly, then, synthetic biology applications challenge the normative postulates of the standard approach, too. I want to first consider how some of the phenomena described by behavioral economists-and behavioral scientists more broadly-might affect people's perceptions of the uncertainties associated with synthetic biology. My analysis will be far from complete, however, because behavioral economics is essentially the study of human behavior, and thus its reach is potentially vast and its development longstanding and ongoing. Nonetheless, I hope to give an indicative perspective on how some aspects of behavioral economics might affect the assessment and perceived acceptability of synthetic biology. I will then consider the issue of agency. Should policy-makers respect people's reactions to synthetic biology when those reactions are known to be driven by behavioral economic phenomena rather than following the normative postulates of rational choice theory? Or should policy-makers dismiss these reactions as inherently biased? I will argue that the normative force of these human reactions (probably) depends on phenomenon and context.",29453843,2018,Behavioral Economics and the Public Acceptance of Synthetic Biology.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) have been investigated in different human neoplasms and were shown to play important roles in the pathogenesis of these diseases; however, very few is known regarding their prognostic importance in the context of ameloblastoma. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if the expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 is associated with ameloblastoma clinical behavior.


METHODS
Fifty-eight cases of ameloblastoma arranged in tissue microarray were submitted to immunohistochemistry against FGF2 and FGFR1. Clinicopathological parameters regarding sex, age, tumor size, duration and location, treatment, recurrences, radiographic features, cortical disruptions, and follow-up data were obtained from patients' medical records and correlated with the molecules expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the prognostic potential of the biomarkers.


RESULTS
Forty-four cases (75.9%) exhibited cytoplasmic positivity for FGF2 in central and peripheral epithelial cells, 46 out of 58 (79.3%) showed FGFR1 cytoplasmic positivity predominantly in the columnar peripheral cells, and 43 cases (74.1%) were positive for both. Expression of FGF2 and FGF2+FGFR1 was associated with tumor recurrences (p = 0.05). However, univariate and multivariate analyses did not demonstrate a significant influence of FGF2, FGFR1 or FGF2+FGFR1 in the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate (p = 0.27, p = 0.33 and p = 0.25, respectively).

1485,"The aim of this review is to clarify the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes, and discuss the therapeutic role of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in type 2 diabetes. OSA patients are more likely than non-OSA populations to develop type 2 diabetes while more than half of patients with type 2 diabetes suffer from OSA. Similarly to the Western countries, in the East Asian population, the association between these two disorders has also been reported. CPAP is the primary treatment for OSA, but the effect of CPAP on comorbid diabetes has not been established. CPAP improved glucose metabolism determined by the oral glucose tolerance test in OSA patients, and several studies have shown that CPAP improves insulin resistance, particularly in obese populations undergoing long-term CPAP. Diabetes is associated with other sleep-related manifestations as well, such as snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Snoring is associated with the development of diabetes, and excessive daytime sleepiness appears to modify insulin resistance. Well-designed studies are needed to clarify the therapeutic effect of CPAP on diabetes. Since both diabetes and OSA lead to cardiovascular disease, clinicians and healthcare professionals should be aware of the association between diabetes and OSA, and should take CPAP and health-related behaviors into consideration when treating patients with diabetes and/or OSA.

Here, we report that the Src family kinases (SFKs) Fyn and Lyn regulate each of these distinct integrin-driven behaviors. Fyn associates with alpha6beta1 and is required to amplify platelet-derived growth factor survival signaling, to promote myelin membrane formation, and to switch neuregulin signaling from a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (thereby changing the response from proliferation to differentiation). However, earlier in the lineage Lyn, not Fyn, is required to drive alphaVbeta3-dependent progenitor proliferation. The two SFKs respond to integrin ligation by different mechanisms: Lyn, by increased autophosphorylation of a catalytic tyrosine; and Fyn, by reduced Csk phosphorylation of the inhibitory COOH-terminal tyrosine. These findings illustrate how different SFKs can act as effectors for specific cell responses during development within a single cell lineage, and, furthermore, provide a molecular mechanism to explain similar region-specific hypomyelination in laminin- and Fyn-deficient mice.",15504915,2004,Integrins direct Src family kinases to regulate distinct phases of oligodendrocyte development.

Despite an increasing use of this model, it remains unclear to what extent the different recommendations are valued by the patients.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to identify the preferences of patients with multiple chronic conditions for recommendations of the Chronic Care Model.


METHODS
The patients' preferences were identified with a discrete choice experiment. The hypothetical general practice cares were described using 10 recommendations of the Chronic Care Model (i.e. shared decision making; informational continuity (INF); regular follow-up; planned care; communication; collaboration with a nurse; advices on health habits; patient empowerment; psychological support; coordination). Respondents were consecutively recruited in a hospital setting during routine follow-up visits to their pulmonary specialist. The sample of respondents included 150 patients with multiple chronic conditions in addition to an obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.


RESULTS
The INF is highly valued by the patients. At the opposite, patients do not appear to value collaboration between nurses and GPs. To a large extent, the patients' preferences for the recommendations of the CCM depend on their gender, number of chronic conditions and self-perceived health condition.


DISCUSSION
The INF appeared to be a minimal requirement to ensure high-quality general practice care. The significant interactions between the patients' socio-demographic characteristics and their preferences for the CCM highlighted the necessity to deliver personalized services.",24948135,2015,What are the patients' preferences for the Chronic Care Model?

3,"OBJECTIVE
To synthesise the views of patients on patient-held records (PHR) and to determine from a patient's perspective the effectiveness and any benefits or drawbacks to the PHR.


DESIGN
Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies, which investigate the perspective of patients on the effectiveness of the PHR.


DATA SOURCES
Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMed, Cochrane.


REVIEW METHODS
Systematic review of literature relevant to the research question and thematic synthesis involving line by line coding of the quotations from participants and the interpretations of the findings offered by authors.


RESULTS
Ten papers that reported the experiences of 455 patients were included in the thematic synthesis. Five studies focused on cancer care, two on mental health, one on antenatal care, one on chronic disease and one on learning disability. The completeness of reporting was variable. Three main themes were identified: (i) practical benefits of the PHR (having a record of one's condition, an aide memoire, useful information source and tool for sharing information across the health system); (ii) psychological benefits of the PHR (empowered to ask questions, a place to record thoughts and feelings and feeling in control); and (iii) drawbacks to the PHR (PHR imposes unwanted responsibility and ineffectiveness).


CONCLUSIONS
The effectiveness of the PHR is largely dependent upon uptake across the health system from patients and health-care providers alike. Robust qualitative studies are needed, which offer more complete reporting and examine what patients want and need from a PHR.",25059439,2015,Patients' views on the effectiveness of patient-held records: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
4,"BACKGROUND
Internet discussion forums provide new, albeit less used data sources for exploring personal experiences of illness and treatment strategies.


OBJECTIVE
To gain an understanding of how discussion forum participants value nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in smoking cessation (SC).


SETTING
Finnish national Internet-based discussion forum, STUMPPI, supporting SC and consisting of ten free discussion areas, each with a different focus. The analysis was based on STUMPPI forum participants' postings (n = 24 481) in five discussion areas during January 2007-January 2012.


DESIGN
Inductive content analysis of the postings concerning NRT use or comparing NRT to other SC methods.


RESULTS
Three major themes related to NRT in SC emerged from the discussions. These were as follows: (I) distrust and negative attitude towards NRT; (II) neutral acceptance of NRT as a useful SC method; and (III) trust on the crucial role of NRT and other SC medicines. The negative attitude was related to following perceptions: NRT use maintains tobacco dependence, fear of NRT dependence or experience of not gaining help from NRT use. NRT was perceived to be useful particularly in the initiation of SC attempts and in dealing with physiological dependence. The most highlighted factors of successful quitting were quitters' own psychological empowerment and peer support from the discussion community.


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of STUMPPI forum participants had low or balanced expectations towards the role of NRT in SC. More research from the smokers' and quitters' perspective is needed to assess the real value of NRT compared to other methods in SC.",25292017,2015,Is nicotine replacement therapy overvalued in smoking cessation?

5,"OBJECTIVE
Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain and various associated symptoms, including psychological distress. This study presents a secondary analysis of the interviews of patients with fibromyalgia to appraise the affective load of the patient narratives as assessed by independent clinicians.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
Three clinicians, an internist, a psychiatrist and a psychologist, who were experienced in chronic pain reviewed the interview transcripts of 56 women eliciting their views regarding fibromyalgia onset. A Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was used (0 = no affective load to 5 = maximum affective load) to provide a subjective appraisal of the intensity of the affective impact, as suggested in the transcripts and from the clinician perspectives.


RESULTS
The mean affective load was 3.6 (SD = ±1), indicating the perception of a high affective load in the clinicians. Values indicating a high or very high affective load (≥4 points on the CGI scale) were more frequent than those in the lower range [23 narratives (41%) vs. 3 (5%)]. The inter-rater agreement of the affective load of the narratives was high (K > 0.85). These results of the clinician perspectives parallel those of the patient narratives, emphasizing disruptive circumstances, psychological distress and hopelessness surrounding symptom onset.


CONCLUSION
The affective load in the narratives of these patients with fibromyalgia was high and had a negative undertone when considered from the clinicians' perspective. This study highlights the importance of considering the affective resonance in the context of therapeutic relationships that are often emotionally laden and highly challenging for the clinician.",25494577,2015,Assessing the affective load in the narratives of women suffering from fibromyalgia: the clinicians' appraisal.
6,"The present study examined the efficacy of Conjoint Behavioral Consultation (CBC) for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in early elementary school. In addition, the parent-teacher relationship, parent and teacher competence in problem solving, and CBC acceptability were examined. Participants included 3 children with ASD in early elementary school, and their parents and teachers. Findings suggested (a) CBC was efficacious for treating children's social behavior in classrooms, (b) 2 of 3 parent-teacher dyads reported improvements in the parent-teacher relationship, (c) all parents and teacher reported increases in their problem-solving competences, and (d) CBC was highly acceptable to parents and teachers. Implications for CBC research and interventions for children with ASD are discussed.

7,"OBJECTIVE
To explore ongoing symptoms, unmet needs, psychological wellbeing, self-efficacy and overall health status in survivors of prostate cancer.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
An invitation to participate in a postal questionnaire survey was sent to 546 men, diagnosed with prostate cancer 9-24 months previously at two UK cancer centres. The study group comprised men who had been subject to a range of treatments: surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and active surveillance. The questionnaire included measures of prostate-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite 26-item version, EPIC-26); unmet needs (Supportive Care Needs Survey 34-item version, SCNS-SF34); anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), self-efficacy (modified Self-efficacy Scale), health status (EuroQol 5D, EQ-5D) and satisfaction with care (questions developed for this study). A single reminder was sent to non-responders after 3 weeks. Data were analysed by age, co-morbidities, and treatment group.


RESULTS
In all, 316 men completed questionnaires (64.1% response rate). Overall satisfaction with follow-up care was high, but was lower for psychosocial than physical aspects of care. Urinary, bowel, and sexual functioning was reported as a moderate/big problem in the last month for 15.2% (n = 48), 5.1% (n = 16), and 36.5% (n = 105) men, respectively. The most commonly reported moderate/high unmet needs related to changes in sexual feelings/relationships, managing fear of recurrence/uncertainty, and concerns about the worries of significant others. It was found that 17% of men (51/307) reported potentially moderate-to-severe levels of anxiety and 10.2% (32/308) reported moderate-to-severe levels of depression. The presence of problematic side-effects was associated with higher psychological morbidity, poorer self-efficacy, greater unmet needs, and poorer overall health status.


CONCLUSION
While some men report relatively few problems after prostate cancer treatment, this study highlights important physical and psycho-social issues for a significant minority of survivors of prostate cancer. Strategies for identifying those men with on-going problems, alongside new interventions and models of care, tailored to individual needs, are needed to improve quality of life.",25818406,2016,"Symptoms, unmet needs, psychological well-being and health status in survivors of prostate cancer: implications for redesigning follow-up."
8,"The purpose of this study was to document within-year fidelity growth during installation and initial implementation of School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS). Participants included school teams from schools throughout the United States that were in years 1 to 4 of SWPBIS implementation and routinely evaluated their implementation fidelity. The fidelity outcome was assessed with the Team Implementation Checklist (TIC) and was completed multiple times per year by SWPBIS teams. Results from multilevel fidelity growth models documented within- and between-school variability and growth predictors. Years implementing, location, school type, and enrollment size were significant predictors of beginning-year fidelity scores (intercept), and years implementing and relative socioeconomic status were significant predictors of the average rate of fidelity change per month of school (slope). These results add to the growing field of implementation science, and practice recommendations are outlined.

9,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the reliability of Direct Behavior Ratings-Social Competence (DBR-SC) ratings. Participants included 60 students identified as possessing deficits in social competence, as well as their 23 classroom teachers. Teachers used DBR-SC to complete ratings of 5 student behaviors within the general education setting on a daily basis across approximately 5 months. During this time, each student was assigned to 1 of 2 intervention conditions, including the Social Competence Intervention-Adolescent (SCI-A) and a business-as-usual (BAU) intervention. Ratings were collected across 3 intervention phases, including pre-, mid-, and postintervention. Results suggested DBR-SC ratings were highly consistent across time within each student, with reliability coefficients predominantly falling in the .80 and .90 ranges. Findings further indicated such levels of reliability could be achieved with only a small number of ratings, with estimates varying between 2 and 10 data points. Group comparison analyses further suggested the reliability of DBR-SC ratings increased over time, such that student behavior became more consistent throughout the intervention period. Furthermore, analyses revealed that for 2 of the 5 DBR-SC behavior targets, the increase in reliability over time was moderated by intervention grouping, with students receiving SCI-A demonstrating greater increases in reliability relative to those in the BAU group. Limitations of the investigation as well as directions for future research are discussed herein.

10,"As the population of immigrant Latino students continues to rise, school psychologists serving Latino children and families must develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide high-quality psychological services to culturally and linguistically diverse students from immigrant families. Following a review of the relevant literature on the educational, social, and emotional needs of immigrant Latino children, we describe Project SUPERB (Scholars Using Psychology and Education to Reach Bilinguals), a grant-funded initiative to address the shortage of bilingual (Spanish-English) school psychologists. We discuss important issues regarding training and preparation to develop the competencies necessary for effective assessment, intervention, and collaboration in the context of school settings to help immigrant children achieve success. Finally, we identify ways in which school psychologists may adopt a leadership role in working with schools and families to promote positive outcomes.

11,"This study aimed to explore the role of school engagement and the mediation effect of acculturation in predicting 1.5 and second-generation migrant adolescents' mental health and risk behaviors. Participants included 448 seventh to tenth grade Israeli students (mean age 14.50, 53% boys): 128 non-Jewish 1.5 generation migrant adolescents (children of migrants living in Israel), 118 second-generation migrants (children of migrants born and living in Israel), and an age-matched sample of 202 native-born Jewish adolescents. All participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing mental health symptoms, engagement in risk behaviors, social adjustment, and school engagement. Both migrant adolescent groups also completed an acculturation questionnaire. Differences between groups in school engagement, mental health symptoms, and risk behavior were examined, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the hypothesized mediating effect of acculturation. Findings revealed substantially higher levels of mental health symptoms (p < .001) and risk behaviors (p = .001) among 1.5 and second-generation migrant adolescents compared with native-born adolescents, with no significant differences between 1.5 generation and second-generation migrants. Migrants' age and gender were associated with mental health symptoms and risk behaviors-older participants engaged in more risk behaviors (p = .02), and females had elevated mental health symptoms (p = .007). Identification with the host country mediated the relationships between school engagement and mental health symptoms (ps .006 and .008) and risk behaviors (ps .001 and .004) in 1.5 generation and second-generation migrants, respectively. The results are discussed in reference to current theories and research, as well as practical implications for prevention and intervention.

12,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between inattention, academic enabling behaviors (i.e., motivation, engagement, and interpersonal skills), and early literacy outcomes. Kindergarten students (N = 181; 55.2% male; 62% white) from two research sites (Southeastern U.S. and Eastern Canada) were assessed using the Letter Naming and Letter Sound Fluency AIMSweb Tests of Early Literacy (Shinn & Shinn, 2012) at three points across the school year. Their teachers provided information on the level of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms (ADHD Symptom Checklist-4; Gadow & Sprafkin, 2008) and academic enabling behaviors (Academic Competence Evaluation Scales; DiPerna & Elliott, 2000). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine predictors of initial level and growth in early literacy. Specifically, a series of models were tested to determine if a multidimensional model of academic enablers (AEs) mediated the relationship. Engagement predicted students' initial levels of early literacy, suggesting that this is an important mediator to consider between inattention and early literacy skills. Motivation related positively to engagement. Inattention also predicted both motivation and interpersonal skills in the negative direction. These findings suggest that AEs play an important role in the relationship between inattention and early literacy. AEs provide malleable targets for intervention and should be considered when developing intervention for youth at risk for academic failure.

13,"Prenatal stress and overexposure to glucocorticoids (GC) during development may be associated with an increased susceptibility to a number of diseases in adulthood including neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In animal models, prenatal overexposure to GC results in hyper-responsiveness to stress in adulthood, and females appear to be more susceptible than males. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexposure to GC during fetal development has sex-specific programming effects on the brain, resulting in altered behaviors in adulthood. We examined the effects of dexamethasone (DEX; a synthetic GC) during prenatal life on stress-related behaviors in adulthood and on the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TpH2) gene expression in the adult dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). TpH2 is the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin (5-HT) synthesis and has been implicated in the etiology of human affective disorders. Timed-pregnant rats were treated with DEX from gestational days 18-22. Male and female offspring were sacrificed on the day of birth (postnatal day 0; P0), P7, and in adulthood (P80-84) and brains were examined for changes in TpH2 mRNA expression. Adult animals were also tested for anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors. In adulthood, prenatal DEX increased anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors selectively in females, as measured by decreased time spent in the center of the open field and increased time spent immobile in the forced swim test, respectively. Prenatal DEX increased TpH2 mRNA selectively in the female caudal DRN at P7, whereas it decreased TpH2 mRNA selectively in the female caudal DRN in adulthood. In animals challenged with restraint stress in adulthood, TpH2 mRNA was significantly lower in rostral DRN of prenatal DEX-treated females compared to vehicle-treated females. These data demonstrated that prenatal overexposure to GC alters the development of TpH2 gene expression and these alterations correlated with lasting behavioral changes found in adult female offspring.",26844389,2016,Sex-dependent programming effects of prenatal glucocorticoid treatment on the developing serotonin system and stress-related behaviors in adulthood.
14,"It is thought that rewarding experiences with drugs create strong contextual associations and encourage repeated intake. In turn, repeated exposures to drugs of abuse make lasting alterations in the brain function of vulnerable individuals, and these persistent alterations likely serve to maintain the maladaptive drug seeking and taking behaviors characteristic of addiction/dependence(2). In rodents, reward experience and contextual associations are frequently measured using the conditioned place preference assay, or CPP, wherein preference for a previously drug-paired context is measured. Behavioral sensitization, on the other hand, is an increase in a drug-induced behavior that develops progressively over repeated exposures. Since sensitized behaviors can often be measured after several months of drug abstinence, depending on the dose and length of initial exposure, they are considered observable correlates of lasting drug-induced plasticity. Researchers have found these assays useful in determining the neurobiological substrates mediating aspects of addiction as well as assessing the potential of different interventions in disrupting these behaviors.

15,"The recruitment of culturally and linguistically diverse students to graduate programs is critical to the overall growth and development of school psychology as a field. Program websites serve as an effective recruitment tool for attracting prospective students, yet there is limited research on how school psychology programs use their websites to recruit diverse students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether school psychology program websites include sufficient levels of diversity-related content critical for attracting diverse applicants. The website content of 250 professional psychology programs (165 school psychology training programs and 85 clinical and counseling psychology programs) were examined for the presence of themes of diversity and multiculturalism that prospective racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse students deem important for selecting a graduate program. Results indicated that school psychology programs had less diversity-related content on their program's website relative to clinical and counseling psychology programs.'

16,"The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of a culturally adapted version of the Strong Start intervention program on the social-emotional outcomes of African American male students. Externalizing behavior problems of children, specifically African American males, are of great concern for schools. Punitive discipline polices such as expulsion and suspension have proved to be ineffective and harmful. Consequently, school-based social-emotional learning (SEL) interventions have been proposed to teach children coping skills that can help them increase positive social behaviors and emotional regulation. Sixty-one African American male students enrolled in an urban elementary school participated in this intervention. This study employed a randomized delayed treatment control design. Results indicated positive effects in the areas of self-regulation and self-competence. However the intervention did not have an impact on student's empathy, responsibility, or externalizing behavior. Implications are discussed in terms of developing culturally relevant school-based interventions for African American males.

18,"Family stressors predict negative psychological outcomes for immigrant adolescents, yet little is known about how such stressors interact to predict school outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the interactive role of family stressors on school outcomes for newcomer adolescent immigrants. Using a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, we used quantitative methods to explore interactions between family separation, acculturative family conflict, and family life events to predict 2 school outcomes, academic achievement (via grade point average [GPA]), and externalizing problems (student- and teacher-reported). The sample included 189 newcomer immigrant public high school students from 34 countries of origin. Quantitative measures included the Multicultural Events Scale for Adolescents, Family Conflicts Scale, and the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). Qualitative data were collected through a semi-structured interview. Quantitative results found that more family life events were associated with lower GPA, but this association was weaker for participants who had been separated from their parents. More family conflict was associated with more externalizing symptoms (both youth- and teacher-reported). However, the association between family conflict and teacher-reported externalizing symptoms was found only among participants reporting a greater than average number of life events. Qualitative results show that separation from extended family networks was among the most stressful of experiences, and demonstrate the highly complex nature of each family stressor domain. At a time when immigration is rapidly changing our school system, a better understanding of early risk factors for new immigrants can help teachers, administrators, and mental health practitioners to identify students with greatest need to foster behavioral, academic, and emotional well-being.

19,"Given the steady increase of students from diverse backgrounds in the U.S. educational system, in particular immigrant and Latino students, it is important to consider how to best support all students within our schools. The present study focuses on the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2) Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS) Parent Spanish form, which is a promising assessment tool for those who are interested in screening for behavioral and emotional risk among Spanish-speaking populations. The present study included 725 students of Latino descent in Grades K-6 in an urban school district and their parents or legal guardians, who served as the informants. All parents completed the BESS language form (English or Spanish) of their choice. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a 4-factor structure (Externalizing, Internalizing, Inattention, and Adaptive Skills) similar to that of the BESS Parent English form: χ2(77) = 248.06, p < .001; CFI = 0.903; TLI = 0.940. However, differential item functioning (DIF) analyses revealed 5 items (16.7%) demonstrated significant levels of DIF, with 4 of the 5 being easier to endorse in English. This study provides preliminary evidence of partial invariance of the BESS Parent across language forms. Although some evidence of invariance across language forms at the structural and item levels exists, more research is necessary to determine whether the DIF found in the present study results in any perceptible test bias.

20,"School psychology trainers have historically struggled to adequately increase the number of professionals from diverse backgrounds. An increase in diverse providers is important in meeting the needs of a burgeoning racial/ethnic minority student population. Previous research suggests that minority undergraduate psychology students have less knowledge and exposure to school psychology than for counseling and clinical psychology, and that students with greater exposure or knowledge of school psychology reported significantly greater choice intentions for school psychology. The purpose of this study is to test the applicability of the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994) in explaining minority undergraduate psychology students' choice intentions for school psychology. This study is an analysis of existing data and is based on a national sample of 283 minority undergraduate psychology students. All instruments used in this study were found to have internal consistency ranging from .83 to .91. Students' learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and choice intentions for school psychology were evaluated by way of a mediator analysis. Results from a path analysis suggest that outcome expectations mediated the relationship between exposure and choice intentions for school psychology.

21,"Shortages of school psychologists and the underrepresentation of minorities in school psychology represent longstanding concerns. Scholars recommend that one way to address both issues is to recruit individuals from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds into school psychology. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics and minority focused findings of school psychology recruitment studies conducted from 1994 to 2014. Using an electronic search that included specified databases, subject terms and study inclusion criteria along with a manual search of 10 school psychology focused journals, the review yielded 10 published, peer-reviewed recruitment studies focused primarily on school psychology over the 20-year span. Two researchers coded these 10 studies using a rigorous coding process that included a high level of inter rater reliability. Results suggest that the studies utilized varied methodologies, primarily sampled undergraduate populations, and mostly included White participants. Five studies focused on minority populations specifically. These studies indicate that programs should actively recruit minority undergraduates and offer financial support to attract minority candidates. Implications suggest a need for more recruitment research focused on minority populations and the implementation and evaluation of minority recruitment models.

22,"In this study, generalizability theory was used to examine the extent to which (a) time-sampling methodology, (b) number of simultaneous behavior targets, and (c) individual raters influenced variance in ratings of academic engagement for an elementary-aged student. Ten graduate-student raters, with an average of 7.20 hr of previous training in systematic direct observation and 58.20 hr of previous direct observation experience, scored 6 videos of student behavior using 12 different time-sampling protocols. Five videos were submitted for analysis, and results for observations using momentary time-sampling and whole-interval recording suggested that the majority of variance was attributable to the rating occasion, although results for partial-interval recording generally demonstrated large residual components comparable with those seen in prior research. Dependability coefficients were above .80 when averaging across 1 to 2 raters using momentary time-sampling, and 2 to 3 raters using whole-interval recording. Ratings derived from partial-interval recording needed to be averaged over 3 to 7 raters to demonstrate dependability coefficients above .80.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-16487-001.) The present study provides a person-centered view on teachers’ adherence to the KiVa antibullying curriculum over a school year. Factor mixture modeling was used to examine how teachers (N = 282) differed in their implementation profiles and multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors related to these profiles. On the basis of lesson adherence across time, 3 types of implementers emerged: (a) high implementers (53%) started at a very high level and remained so over time, (b) moderate implementers (30%) consistently utilized more than half of the lesson material, and (c) surrenders (17%) started at a high level that soon declined. Teachers’ beliefs toward program effectiveness were positively associated with starting at higher levels of fidelity (high and surrenders), whereas principal support for antibullying work predicted maintaining the initial level of implementation over the school year (high and moderate). Finally, good lesson preparation and student engagement were associated with a higher levels of implementation throughout the school year (the high group). Neither participation in preimplementation training nor classroom management skills were related to 3 implementation profiles.

24,"For children with the most serious and persistent academic and behavior problems, parent involvement in education, particularly teacher perceptions of involvement, is essential to avert their expected long-term negative outcomes. Despite the widespread interest in and perceived importance of parent involvement in education, however, few experimental studies have evaluated programs and practices to promote it. In this group randomized trial, we examined the effects of the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management program (IY TCM) on teacher perceptions of contact and comfort with parents. One hundred five classrooms with 1818 students were randomly assigned to an IY TCM or to a control, business as usual condition. Measures of key constructs included teacher ratings of parent and student behaviors, direct observations in the classroom, and a standardized academic achievement test. Latent transition analysis (LTA) was used to identify patterns of involvement over time and to determine if intervention condition predicted postintervention patterns and transitions. Four patterns of involvement were identified at baseline and at follow-up; parents of students with academic and behavior problems were most likely to be in classes with the least adaptive involvement patterns. Intervention status predicted group membership at follow-up. Specifically, intervention classroom parents were significantly more likely to transition to more adaptive teacher-rated parenting profiles at follow-up compared to control classroom parents. This is the first randomized trial we are aware of that has found that teacher training can alter teacher perceptions of parent involvement patterns. Clinical implications for students with behavior and academic problems are discussed.

25,"Why is there a need to increase the racial/ethnic diversity of faculty in school psychology? Chiefly, school psychologists serve the most racially/ethnically diverse population: children in US schools. Therefore, developing a knowledge base that is inclusive of this wide range of perspective as well as growing a workforce that is reflective of this diversity is essential to effective service delivery. To achieve this goal, school psychology trainers must develop evidence-based, purposeful efforts to recruit and retain racial/ethnic minority students in doctoral programs. For these reasons, we called for a special issue on diversifying the field of school psychology. The purpose of this special issue is to advance the evidence-base in school psychology on how to increase diverse scholars and leaders in the profession. Moreover, the goal is to also evaluate the status of the profession in effectively recruiting and retaining racial/ethnic minority graduate students, mentoring racial/ethnic minority students to pursue careers in academia, and promoting faculty development and retention of racially and ethnically diverse faculty. Thus, the articles in this special issue will address critical areas where trainers can improve recruitment and retention strategies that will increase the racial/ethnic diversity of school psychology faculty, leaders, and practitioners.

28,"OBJECTIVE
To describe differences in in-seat behavior observed between individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) with and without a history of recurrent pressure injuries.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional cohort study.


SETTING
General community.


PARTICIPANTS
Twenty-nine adults more than 2 years post SCI, who used a wheelchair as their primary mobility device and had the ability to independently perform weight shift maneuvers. Participants were grouped according to whether or not they had a history of recurrent pressure injuries (PrIs), with 12 subjects having had two or more pressure injuries in the pelvic area (PrI Group).


INTERVENTIONS
Not applicable.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Daily time in wheelchair, number of transfers, and frequency of pressure reliefs (full unloading), weight shifts (30% load reduction), and in-seat movements (transient center of pressure movements or unloading).


RESULTS
The median participant spent 10.3 hours in his wheelchair and performed 16 transfers to or from the wheelchair daily. Pressure reliefs were performed less than once every 3 hours in both groups. Weight shifts were performed significantly more often by the No PrI Group (median (interquartile range) 2.5 (1.0-3.6) per hour) than the PrI Group (1.0 (0.4-1.9), with P = 0.037 and effect size r = 0.39). In-seat movements were performed 46.5 (28.7-76.7) times per hour by the No PrI group and 39.6 (24.3-49.7) times per hour for the PrI group (P = 0.352, effect size r = 0.17).


CONCLUSION
Weight shifts that can be produced by functional activities and that partially unload the buttocks should be considered as an important addition to individuals' PrI prevention regimen.",27841101,2018,"Some people move it, move it… for pressure injury prevention."
29,"BACKGROUND
Community pharmacists are well-positioned to address the US opioid medication crisis, which has created a need to detect misuse risk in order to provide optimal patient care.


OBJECTIVES
This study sought to identify community pharmacy patient subgroups at risk for opioid medication misuse.


METHODS
This study was a cross-sectional survey that examined behavioral, mental, and physical health characteristics among patients filling opioid pain medications. A convenience sample of adult patients filling opioid pain medications who were not receiving cancer treatment were screened in 2 urban and 2 rural community pharmacies in southwestern Pennsylvania. Patient subgroups were identified using latent class analysis. Latent class regression analysis was used to examine the association between subgroup membership and misuse.


RESULTS
A total of 333 patients completed the survey (response rate 71.4%). Latent class analysis results showed that a 3-class solution best fit the data, which were labeled: mental health (8.4%, n = 28), poor health (79.6%, n = 265), and hazardous alcohol use (12%, n = 40). Individuals within the mental health subgroup had an increased risk for opioid medication misuse (Odds Ratio = 6.23, 95% CI = 5.13-7.33).


CONCLUSION
These findings demonstrate heterogeneity of this population receiving prescribed opioids and the potential to identify subgroups with high misuse risk. These findings also support routine screening of patients filling opioid medications and suggest the need for evidence-based patient-centered intervention development.",27876595,2017,"Behavioral, mental, and physical health characteristics and opioid medication misuse among community pharmacy patients: A latent class analysis."
30,"The Achilles is the thickest tendon in the body and is the primary elastic energy-storing component during running. The form and function of the human Achilles is complex: twisted structure, intratendinous interactions, and differential motor control from the triceps surae muscles make Achilles behavior difficult to intuit. Recent in vivo imaging of the Achilles has revealed nonuniform displacement patterns that are not fully understood and may result from complex architecture and musculotendon interactions. In order to understand which features of the Achilles tendon give rise to the nonuniform deformations observed in vivo, we used computational modeling to predict the mechanical contributions from different features of the tendon. The aims of this study are to: (i) build a novel computational model of the Achilles tendon based on ultrashort echo time MRI, (ii) compare simulated displacements with published in vivo ultrasound measures of displacement, and (iii) use the model to elucidate the effects of tendon twisting, intratendon sliding, retrocalcaneal insertion, and differential muscle forces on tendon deformation. Intratendon sliding and differential muscle forces were found to be the largest factors contributing to displacement nonuniformity between tendon regions. Elimination of intratendon sliding or muscle forces reduced displacement nonuniformity by 96% and 85%, respectively, while elimination of tendon twist and the retrocalcaneal insertion reduced displacement nonuniformity by only 35% and 3%. These results suggest that changes in the complex internal structure of the tendon alter the interaction between muscle forces and tendon behavior and therefore may have important implications on muscle function during movement.",27919416,2017,A 3D model of the Achilles tendon to determine the mechanisms underlying nonuniform tendon displacements.
31,"Assessment of clinical symptoms requires information from multiple informants. Discrepancies between informants' ratings can have significant implications in school settings (e.g., access to services, treatment planning, progress monitoring). This study examined parent-teacher discrepancies for ratings of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and adaptive skills of high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder. A total of 236 Behavior Assessment System for Children-2nd Edition ratings of children with high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder from 2 informant groups (parents and teachers) were analyzed. Each informant pair (n = 118 parents/caregivers and n = 118 teachers) rated the same child. Scores on the Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, and Adaptive Skills Composites were examined for mean differences, level of agreement, linear relationship, and moderators of discrepancies. There were no significant mean differences between raters for the Internalizing and Externalizing Composites or their constituent scales (except Hyperactivity). Parent-teacher ratings on these composites and scales were significantly correlated (generally moderate), and the discrepancies were not moderated by the included child or parent variables. In contrast, teacher ratings were significantly higher than parents for the Adaptive Skills Composite and several of its constituent scales. Correlations between informants on the Adaptive Skills Composite were significant (low-to-moderate), with notable variability in the correlations among its constituent scales. The degree of parent-teacher discrepancy differed significantly across the Adaptive Skills Composite score range, but it was not moderated by the included child or parent variables. This study suggests a reduced likelihood of informant discrepancies for externalizing and internalizing symptoms, with larger discrepancies expected when assessing adaptive skills.

32,"In 2 studies, we evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of peer-mediated, school-based discrete trial training (DTT) for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the first, 6 typically developing elementary-age students were trained to use DTT procedures to teach target academic skills to 3 students with ASD who had been educated in a self-contained setting. A multiple probe-across-tutors design was applied to evaluate the accuracy with which the tutors implemented the DTT protocol. Results of the study indicated that training was effective in increasing the integrity of implementation of the DTT protocol. In addition, improvements in integrity were maintained following termination of training. To assess the effectiveness of the ability of previously untrained tutors to teach new, target behaviors to different children with ASD, a second study was conducted. Five of the 6 tutors taught 2 or 3 skills in a multiple probe fashion to children with ASD whom they had not previously tutored. Results suggest that peer tutors effectively generalized skills, as shown by participants with ASD who demonstrated rapid improvements in level and trend of target behaviors. Observations of social engagement during unstructured periods were conducted prior to and following intervention as a measure of social validity. Substantial increases in duration of engagement were noted, suggesting that peer-mediated DTT may result in meaningful improvements in both academic skills and inclusion with peers.

33,"In analyzing data from the National Database for Autism Research, we utilized Mokken scaling techniques as a means of creating a more effective and efficient screening procedure for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) via the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). With a sample of 1,040, approximately 80% (n = 827) of the sample were males while approximately 20% (n = 213) were females. In regard to ethnicity, approximately 68% of the sample were White/Caucasian, while 7% were African American, 16% were Hispanic, 4% were Asian, and 1% were Native American or American Indian. As the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) states that, ""individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder,"" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 51), the primary labeling difference between the DSM-IV and the DSM-5 would appear to be in identifying social communication disorder as a newly introduced disorder in the DSM-5, which we discuss. Though school psychologists are not dependent on the DSM to the same extent as clinical psychologists to provide services, school psychology is invested in the effective and efficient assessment of ASD. The current study demonstrates how Mokken scaling procedures may be utilized with respect to ASD identification via the SCQ as well as providing information regarding the prevalence of potential social communication disorder as a new disorder and its discrimination with ASD.

36,"Estrogens exert profound effects on the expression of anxiety in humans and rodents; however, the directionality of these effects varies considerably within both clinical and preclinical literature. It is believed that discrepancies regarding the nature of estrogens' effects on anxiety are attributable to the differential effects of specific estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes. In this chapter we will discuss the relative impact on anxiety and anxiety-like behavior of each of the three main ERs: ERα, which has a generally anxiogenic effect, ERβ, which has a generally anxiolytic effect, and the G-protein-coupled ER known as GPR30, which has been found to both increase and decrease anxiety-like behavior. In addition, we will describe the known mechanisms by which these receptor subtypes exert their influence on emotional responses, focusing on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the oxytocinergic and serotonergic systems. The impact of estrogens on the expression of anxiety is likely the result of their combined effects on all of these neurobiological systems.",28061972,2017,Estrogen Receptors Modulation of Anxiety-Like Behavior.
37,"Phytoestrogens are plant derived, non-steroidal compounds naturally found in rodent chows that potentially have endocrine-disrupting effects. Isoflavones, the most common phytoestrogens, have a similar structure and molecular weight to 17β-estradiol (E2) and have the ability to bind and activate both isoforms of the estrogen receptor (ER). Most isoflavones have a higher affinity for ERβ, which is involved in sexually dimorphic behavioral regulation. The goal of this study was to examine the interaction of isoflavones and E2 presence in the OVX rat on anxiety- and depressive- like behavior and the related BDNF pathophysiology. E2 administration resulted in anxiogenic behaviors when isoflavones were present in the diet (p<0.05), but anxiolytic behaviors when isoflavones were not present (p<0.05). E2 resulted in antidepressive-like behaviors in animals fed an isoflavone-rich diet (p<0.05), with no effect when isoflavones were removed. Increased hippocampal BDNF expression was observed in animals fed an isoflavone-rich diet after E2 administration (p<0.05). BDNF expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus was increased after E2 treatment in animals fed an isoflavone-rich diet. Overall, these results demonstrate that the presence of dietary isoflavones can differentially regulate the effect of E2 replacement on behavior and BDNF expression.",28077306,2017,The interaction of dietary isoflavones and estradiol replacement on behavior and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the ovariectomized rat.
38,"Among the protective factors associated with reduced risk for suicide, scientific inquiries into school connectedness are especially important considering that schools are ideally situated to provide interventions reaching the vast majority of youth. Although there is a wealth of research that supports the association between school connectedness and reduced self-report of adolescents having a suicidal thought or making a suicide attempt, inconsistencies in the way studies have measured and operationalized school connectedness limit synthesis across findings. This meta-analytic study investigates the literature exploring associations between school connectedness and suicidal thoughts and behaviors across general and subpopulations (high risk and sexual minority youth) using a random effects model. Eligible studies examined a measure of school connectedness explicitly referred to as ""school connectedness"" or ""connections at school"" in relation to suicidal ideation or suicide attempts among youth enrolled in school (Grades 6-12). Multiple metaregression analyses were conducted to explore the influence of school connectedness measurement variation, as well as participant characteristics. Results, including 16 samples, support that higher school connectedness is associated with reduced reports of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across general (odds ratio [OR] = 0.536), high-risk (OR = 0.603), and sexual minority (OR = 0.608) adolescents. Findings are consistent when analyzed separately for suicidal ideation (OR = 0.529) and suicide attempts (OR = 0.589) and remain stable when accounting for measurement variability. Although limited by its cross-sectional nature, findings support recent calls to increase school connectedness and proffer important implications for screening and intervention efforts conducted in schools.

39,"During the last 20 years, predictive modeling in epilepsy research has largely been concerned with the prediction of seizure events, whereas the inference of effective brain targets for resective surgery has received surprisingly little attention. In this exploratory pilot study, we describe a distributional clustering framework for the modeling of multivariate time series and use it to predict the effects of brain surgery in epilepsy patients. By analyzing the intracranial EEG, we demonstrate how patients who became seizure free after surgery are clearly distinguished from those who did not. More specifically, for 5 out of 7 patients who obtained seizure freedom (= Engel class I) our method predicts the specific collection of brain areas that got actually resected during surgery to yield a markedly lower posterior probability for the seizure related clusters, when compared to the resection of random or empty collections. Conversely, for 4 out of 5 Engel class III/IV patients who still suffer from postsurgical seizures, performance of the actually resected collection is not significantly better than performances displayed by random or empty collections. As the number of possible collections ranges into billions and more, this is a substantial contribution to a problem that today is still solved by visual EEG inspection. Apart from epilepsy research, our clustering methodology is also of general interest for the analysis of multivariate time series and as a generative model for temporally evolving functional networks in the neurosciences and beyond.

40,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) leads to physical and cognitive disability. Specifically, cognitive deficits in PPMS have been explained by both grey matter atrophy and white matter lesions. However, existing research still lacks in the understanding of how the brain of a patient with PPMS functions under cognitive control demands. Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine information integration in patients with PPMS using a search-based effective connectivity method. Fourteen patients with PPMS and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) performed the Stroop task, a cognitively demanding interference task that taxes neural resources required for cognitive control and response inhibition. Results showed that compared to HC, PPMS patients exhibited poor behavioral performance and alterations in information flow, manifested in the form of the loss of top-down connections, reversal of connections, and hyperconnectivity. Significant correlations were observed between connection strengths and behavioral measures. The connection between the posterior parietal cortex (PCC) and left posterior parietal lobule, which was present in both groups, showed a negative correlation with performance accuracy on incongruent trials. The connection between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and PCC showed a positive correlation with performance accuracy on incongruent trials. However, the adaptive nature of this connection was not significant on a behavioral level as the PPMS group performed significantly worse compared to the HC group during the Stroop task. Thus, the current study provides important evidence about effective connectivity patterns that can be characterized as maladaptive cerebral re-organization in the PPMS brain.

41,"We use polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) to predict smoking, and addiction to nicotine, alcohol or drugs in individuals not diagnosed with psychotic disorders. Using PRSs for 144 609 subjects, including 10 036 individuals admitted for in-patient addiction treatment and 35 754 smokers, we find that diagnoses of various substance use disorders and smoking associate strongly with PRSs for SCZ (P = 5.3 × 10-50 -1.4 × 10-6 ) and BPD (P = 1.7 × 10-9 -1.9 × 10-3 ), showing shared genetic etiology between psychosis and addiction. Using standardized scores for SCZ and BPD scaled to a unit increase doubling the risk of the corresponding disorder, the odds ratios for alcohol and substance use disorders range from 1.19 to 1.31 for the SCZ-PRS, and from 1.07 to 1.29 for the BPD-PRS.

42,"The genetic effects on specific behavioral phenotypes are putatively mediated by specific neural functions. It remains unexplored how the axon-guidance-receptor gene ROBO1 influences reading performance through the neural system despite the identification of ROBO1 as a susceptibility gene for dyslexia. To address this issue, the present study recruited a group of children with a wide range of reading abilities. Two previously identified reading-related ROBO1 polymorphisms were genotyped, and diffusion and structural MRI were acquired to measure the fiber microstructure of the corpus callosum (CC), the major white-matter tract that connects inter-hemispheric cortical regions. The results confirmed the significant influence of the ROBO1 polymorphisms on reading scores. The fiber microstructures of the midline-CC segments around the genu and splenium were also affected by the ROBO1 polymorphisms. Moreover, a mediation analysis further revealed that the genu could significantly mediate the effects of the ROBO1 polymorphisms on word-list reading performance, which suggests a ROBO1-to-genu-to-reading pathway. The genu-linked cortical morphology, however, was not associated with either the ROBO1 polymorphisms or reading performance. These findings offer direct evidence supporting ROBO1-callosum association in humans and also provide valuable insight into the functions of ROBO1 and the gene-to-brain mechanisms that underlie human reading.

43,"Apathy is a prominent and influential symptom in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, but it also occurs in the healthy population. It has considerable impact on daily life functioning, in clinical as well as healthy samples. Even though cognitive control is thought to be disrupted in people with apathy, the exact neural underpinnings of apathy remain unclear. Because flexible shifting between behaviors (set-shifting) is crucial for goal-directed behavior, disruptions in set-shifting may underlie apathy. In this study, the neural correlates of apathy during set-shifting were studied in 34 healthy participants with varying levels of apathy, measured by the Apathy Evaluation Scale. During functional MRI scanning participants performed a set-shifting task, distinguishing between behavioral switches (a change in response to different stimuli), cognitive switches (a change in response rule), and salience decoupling (detecting a change in relevant stimuli). Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between apathy and brain activation. Results showed that higher apathy scores were related to reduced activation in the medial superior frontal gyrus and cerebellum (Crus I/II) during cognitive set-shifting, but not behavioral shifting and salience decoupling. No relationship between apathy and accuracy or response time was found. These results support the idea that alterations in the neural basis of cognitive control, especially cognitive set-shifting, may contribute to apathy.

44,"Healthy aging is associated with a decline in cognitive, executive, and motor processes that are concomitant with changes in brain activation patterns, particularly at high complexity levels. While speech production relies on all these processes, and is known to decline with age, the mechanisms that underlie these changes remain poorly understood, despite the importance of communication on everyday life. In this cross-sectional group study, we investigated age differences in the neuromotor control of speech production by combining behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Twenty-seven healthy adults underwent fMRI while performing a speech production task consisting in the articulation of nonwords of different sequential and motor complexity. Results demonstrate strong age differences in movement time (MT), with longer and more variable MT in older adults. The fMRI results revealed extensive age differences in the relationship between BOLD signal and MT, within and outside the sensorimotor system. Moreover, age differences were also found in relation to sequential complexity within the motor and attentional systems, reflecting both compensatory and de-differentiation mechanisms. At very high complexity level (high motor complexity and high sequence complexity), age differences were found in both MT data and BOLD response, which increased in several sensorimotor and executive control areas. Together, these results suggest that aging of motor and executive control mechanisms may contribute to age differences in speech production. These findings highlight the importance of studying functionally relevant behavior such as speech to understand the mechanisms of human brain aging.

A recently developed Mg-Ca-Sr alloy possesses advantageous characteristics over other Mg alloys, having a good combination of strength and degradation behavior, while also displaying potentially osteogenic properties. To better understand the effect of alloy degradation products on cellular mechanisms, in vitro studies using human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were conducted. Ionic products of alloy dissolution were found to be nontoxic but changed the proliferation profile of stem cells. Furthermore, their presence changed the progress of osteogenic development, while concentrations of Mg in particular appeared to induce stem cell differentiation.

47,"INTRODUCTION
Teachable moments (TMs) are situations with potential for promoting health behavior change. Little is known as to whether colonoscopy screening itself may serve as a TM, particularly among low-income or minority populations. Research in this area is needed to inform efforts to address the disproportionate burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) experienced by minorities.


AIMS
This study aims to describe attitudes related to physical activity (PA) and healthy eating among a low-income Hispanic and African American sample, assess whether colonoscopy completion may encourage changes in dietary behavior or PA, and determine the type of interventions minority participants would prefer to promote preventive behaviors.


METHODS
Average-risk African American and Hispanic individuals who are referred for a screening colonoscopy at a Primary Care Clinic between May 2008 and December 2011 were eligible. Data were collected at three time points: at recruitment, 2 weeks before their colonoscopy, and 1 month after their colonoscopy (n = 537).


RESULTS
The difference in change in PA from baseline to post-colonoscopy follow-up between those who had a colonoscopy and those who did not was significant (p = .04). Those who completed a colonoscopy increased their PA by 0.26 days on average, whereas, those who did not decreased their PA by 0.46 days.


DISCUSSION
Findings suggest that the time following colonoscopy completion may be ideal to provide health promotion for PA and healthy eating. Future research is needed to explore the mechanisms that influence health behavior change as a result of colonoscopies to inform the development of interventions in this area.",28374335,2018,Preventive Health Behaviors Among Low-Income African American and Hispanic Populations: Can Colonoscopy Screening Serve as a Teachable Moment?
48,"OBJECTIVE
Family caregivers of people with dementia often report high levels of stress and depression, but little is known about those who contemplate suicide or self-harm. This study explores thoughts of suicide, self-harm and death in dementia caregivers and investigates the characteristics that distinguish them from those without such thoughts.


METHODS
Data were collected every 3 months, for 24 months, from 192 family caregivers of people with dementia living in the Netherlands. Caregivers did not have a clinical depression or anxiety disorder at baseline. Suicide-related thoughts were measured with an item from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a diagnostic instrument for DSM-IV mental disorders. Fisher exact, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests compared the characteristics of caregivers who had contemplated suicide with two comparison groups.


RESULTS
Within 24 months, 76 caregivers reported symptoms of a potential depression and were further assessed for suicidal thoughts. Nine carers (11.8%, 4.7% of the total sample) reported suicidal thoughts with three of those at multiple points. Caregivers with suicidal thoughts had more severe depressive and anxious symptoms, had a lower sense of competence and mastery, felt less happy and experienced more health problems, less family support and more feelings of loneliness than caregivers who had not.


CONCLUSION
Suicidal thoughts are present in dementia caregivers and can persist across the care trajectory. Various psychological and social characteristics significantly distinguish caregivers with suicidal thoughts from those without. More research is needed to enable the identification of high-risk caregivers and provide an evidence base for the development of preventive strategies and interventions. © 2017 The Authors.

49,"When attempting to predict future events, people commonly rely on historical data. One psychological characteristic of judgmental forecasting of time series, established by research, is that when people make forecasts from series, they tend to underestimate future values for upward trends and overestimate them for downward ones, so-called trend-damping (modeled by anchoring on, and insufficient adjustment from, the average of recent time series values). Events in a time series can be experienced sequentially (dynamic mode), or they can also be retrospectively viewed simultaneously (static mode), not experienced individually in real time. In one experiment, we studied the influence of presentation mode (dynamic and static) on two sorts of judgment: (a) predictions of the next event (forecast) and (b) estimation of the average value of all the events in the presented series (average estimation). Participants' responses in dynamic mode were anchored on more recent events than in static mode for all types of judgment but with different consequences; hence, dynamic presentation improved prediction accuracy, but not estimation. These results are not anticipated by existing theoretical accounts; we develop and present an agent-based model-the adaptive anchoring model (ADAM)-to account for the difference between processing sequences of dynamically and statically presented stimuli (visually presented data). ADAM captures how variation in presentation mode produces variation in responses (and the accuracy of these responses) in both forecasting and judgment tasks. ADAM's model predictions for the forecasting and judgment tasks fit better with the response data than a linear-regression time series model. Moreover, ADAM outperformed autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) and exponential-smoothing models, while neither of these models accounts for people's responses on the average estimation task.",28382639,2018,Adaptive Anchoring Model: How Static and Dynamic Presentations of Time Series Influence Judgments and Predictions.
50,"OBJECTIVE
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most important progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by cognitive and behavioral disabilities. Nowadays, tau, as a microtubuleassociated protein and a principle neuropathological hallmark of AD, provides us a neoteric perspective to explore further aetiopathogenesis and therapeutic strategy. The hyperphosphorylation and abnormal aggregation of tau, combined with its decreased clearance, form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and exert neurotoxicity in AD.


METHODS
Recent investigations aim to prevent the deposition of NFT and accelerate the clearance of NFT. Intriguingly, immunization strategies targeting tau effectively ameliorates the tau-associated pathology in AD. In addition, modified therapies targeting tau should be regarded as a potential way to treat AD. These progresses open new avenues for AD.


CONCLUSION
Here, we review the recent literature of potential mechanisms of the tau in AD and discuss the modified therapeutic strategies for AD.",28413986,2018,Tau in Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Strategies.
51,"Despite international waters covering over 60% of the world's oceans, understanding of how fisheries in these regions shape ecosystem processes is surprisingly poor. Seabirds forage at fishing vessels, which has potentially deleterious effects for their population, but the extent of overlap and behavior in relation to ships is poorly known. Using novel biologging devices, which detect radar emissions and record the position of boats and seabirds, we measured the true extent of the overlap between seabirds and fishing vessels and generated estimates of the intensity of fishing and distribution of vessels in international waters. During breeding, wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) from the Crozet Islands patrolled an area of over 10 million km2 at distances up to 2500 km from the colony. Up to 79.5% of loggers attached to birds detected vessels. The extent of overlap between albatrosses and fisheries has widespread implications for bycatch risk in seabirds and reveals the areas of intense fishing throughout the ocean. We suggest that seabirds equipped with radar detectors are excellent monitors of the presence of vessels in the Southern Ocean and offer a new way to monitor the presence of illegal fisheries and to better understand the impact of fisheries on seabirds.",28598528,2018,Use of radar detectors to track attendance of albatrosses at fishing vessels.
52,"Effortful motivation and reward valuation learning deficits are associated with negative symptoms and impaired cognition in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Whereas clinical assessments of motivation and reward value typically rely upon clinician ratings or self-report scales, behavioral measures often confound these constructs. Simple reverse-translated behavioral tasks that independently quantify motivation and reward valuation-which could then be linked to cognition-may facilitate the development of pro-cognitive therapeutics by bridging the ""preclinical-to-clinical"" gap. This study determined whether novel behavioral measures of effortful motivation and reward valuation are associated with impaired cognition in SZ patients (n=36). Patients completed the Progressive Ratio Breakpoint task (PRBT; physical effort motivation) and the Probabilistic Learning Task (PLT; reward learning/valuation) in conjunction with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). SZ patients exhibited statistically significant deficits in global cognition and all individual MCCB subdomains. Significant correlations were observed between PRBT and MCCB global cognition (r=0.52), speed of processing (r=0.56) and attention vigilance (r=0.48) subdomains, but not with PLT or clinical symptoms. Results indicate that effort and reward learning deficits are dissociable targets that can improve our understanding of cognitive impairments associated among patients with SZ. More importantly, the results support the long-standing notion that the measurement of cognitive impairments in SZ is highly linked to a willingness to expend effort. The availability of a PRBT designed for use in both rodents and humans could improve our understanding of the nature of cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders and accelerate the development of novel pro-cognitive therapeutics.",28673753,2017,Relationship between effortful motivation and neurocognition in schizophrenia.
53,"BACKGROUND
It has been shown that theta (6-10 Hz) and delta (1-6 Hz) ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms revealed variations in the cortical arousal in C57 Wild Type (WT) mice during cage exploration (active condition) compared to awake quiet behavior (passive condition; IMI PharmaCog project, www.pharmacog.eu).


OBJECTIVE
The objective was to test if these EEG rhythms might be abnormal in old PDAPP mice modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a hAPP Indiana V717F mutation (They show abnormal neural transmission, cognitive deficits, and brain accumulation of Aβ1-42).


METHODS
Ongoing EEG rhythms were recorded by a frontoparietal bipolar channel in 15 PDAPP and 23 WT C57 male mice (mean age of 22.8 months ±0.4 and 0.3 standard error, respectively). EEG absolute power (density) was calculated. Frequency and amplitude of individual delta and theta frequency (IDF and ITF) peaks were considered during passive and active states in the wakefulness.


RESULTS
Compared with the WT group, the PDAPP group showed higher frequency of the IDF during the passive condition and lower frequency of the ITF during the active state. Furthermore, the WT but not PDAPP group showed significant changes in the frontoparietal EEG power (IDF, ITF) during active over passive state.


CONCLUSION
PDAPP mice were characterized by less changes in the brain arousal during an active state as revealed by frontoparietal EEG rhythms. Future studies will have to cross-validate the present results on large animal groups, clarify the neurophysiological underpinning of the effect, and test if the disease modifying drugs against AD amyloidosis normalize those candiate EEG biomarkers in PDAPP mice.",28675996,2018,Ongoing Electroencephalographic Activity Associated with Cortical Arousal in Transgenic PDAPP Mice (hAPP V717F).
54,"PURPOSE
To detect local cholinergic changes in human medial temporal lobe during configural working memory performance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) measurements were acquired at 3T from a 2 × 2 × 3 cm voxel in right medial temporal lobe from 36 subjects during performance of a configural visual working memory task (cWMT). In order to compensate for expected task-based blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) T2 * effects, resonance signal changes of unbound choline-containing metabolites (Cho) were referenced to an internal standard of creatine + phosphocreatine metabolites (Cre) and compared between four task blocks: rest, memorization, active memory maintenance, and recognition. An unannounced memory retention test was conducted in 21 subjects. Quality assurance analyses examined task-based Cho and Cre individually as well as referenced to resonance signal from N-acetylaspartate (NAA).


RESULTS
Increases from a resting baseline in the Cho/Cre ratio were observed during 60-second blocks of active memory maintenance across the group (P = 0.0042). Behavioral accuracy during task performance correlated with memory retention (r = 0.48, P = 0.027). Quality assurance measures showed task-based changes in Cre resonance signal both individually (P = 0.00099) and when utilized as a noncholinergic internal reference (NAA/Cre, P = 0.00079).


CONCLUSION
Increases in human medial temporal lobe 1 H-MRS Cho/Cre ratio occur during the maintenance of configural working memory information. However, interpretation of these results as driven by cholinergic activity cannot be assumed, as NAA, a noncholinergic metabolite, shows similar results when utilizing Cre as a reference. Caution is advised when considering Cre as an internal standard for task-based 1 H-MRS measurements.

55,"Over the past few decades, (poly)peptide block copolymers have been widely employed in generating well-defined nanostructures as vehicles for targeted drug delivery applications. We previously reported the assembly of thermoresponsive nanoscale vesicles from an elastin-b-collagen-like peptide (ELP-CLP). The vesicles were observed to dissociate at elevated temperatures, despite the LCST-like behavior of the tethered ELP domain, which is suggested to be triggered by the unfolding of the CLP domain. Here, the potential of using the vesicles as drug delivery vehicles for targeting collagen-containing matrices is evaluated. The sustained release of an encapsulated model drug was achieved over a period of 3 weeks, following which complete release could be triggered via heating. The ELP-CLP vesicles show strong retention on a collagen substrate, presumably through collagen triple helix interactions. Cell viability and proliferation studies using fibroblasts and chondrocytes suggest that the vesicles are highly cytocompatible. Additionally, essentially no activation of a macrophage-like cell line is observed, suggesting that the vesicles do not initiate an inflammatory response. Endowed with thermally controlled delivery, the ability to bind collagen, and excellent cytocompatibility, these ELP-CLP nanovesicles are suggested to have significant potential in the controlled delivery of drugs to collagen-containing matrices and tissues.",28719196,2017,Thermoresponsive Elastin-b-Collagen-Like Peptide Bioconjugate Nanovesicles for Targeted Drug Delivery to Collagen-Containing Matrices.

Combining opioid medications and alcohol has serious implications for patient health, including overdose. Information regarding those who use/misuse opioid medications and engage in unhealthy alcohol use is limited to pharmacological and epidemiological descriptions. This study presents opioid medication misuse and behavioral, mental, and physical health characteristics of persons filling opioid medications that are engaged in unhealthy alcohol use.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 5 community pharmacies in Southwestern, Pennsylvania among patients filling opioid medications. Respondents completed validated opioid medication misuse, alcohol use, illicit drug use, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and physical health functioning assessments. We present univariate and multivariate statistics describing opioid medication misuse and health risks among those positive for unhealthy alcohol use.


RESULTS
A total of 344 patients completed the survey (75.8% response). A total of 15.9% of respondents screened positive for opioid medication misuse, of whom 20.3% reported unhealthy alcohol use. Taking opioid medications too often was reported among a larger proportion of the sample with unhealthy alcohol use (34.3%) compared to those without (22.1%, p=0.04). Further, among respondents with unhealthy alcohol use, illicit drug use (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=12.14, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.64-89.72) and PTSD (AOR=9.77, 95% CI=1.70-56.11) were associated with increased odds for opioid medication misuse.

57,"OBJECTIVES
Developing compassion towards oneself has been linked to improvement in many areas of psychological well-being, including psychosis. Furthermore, developing a non-judgemental, accepting way of relating to voices is associated with lower levels of distress for people who hear voices. These factors have also been associated with secure attachment. This study explores associations between the constructs of mindfulness of voices, self-compassion, and distress from hearing voices and how secure attachment style related to each of these variables.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional online.


METHOD
One hundred and twenty-eight people (73% female; Mage  = 37.5; 87.5% Caucasian) who currently hear voices completed the Self-Compassion Scale, Southampton Mindfulness of Voices Questionnaire, Relationships Questionnaire, and Hamilton Programme for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire.


RESULTS
Results showed that mindfulness of voices mediated the relationship between self-compassion and severity of voices, and self-compassion mediated the relationship between mindfulness of voices and severity of voices. Self-compassion and mindfulness of voices were significantly positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with distress and severity of voices.


CONCLUSION
Mindful relation to voices and self-compassion are associated with reduced distress and severity of voices, which supports the proposed potential benefits of mindful relating to voices and self-compassion as therapeutic skills for people experiencing distress by voice hearing.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Greater self-compassion and mindfulness of voices were significantly associated with less distress from voices. These findings support theory underlining compassionate mind training. Mindfulness of voices mediated the relationship between self-compassion and distress from voices, indicating a synergistic relationship between the constructs.

58,"Social relationships throughout life are vital for well-being and physical and mental health. A significant amount of research in animal models as well as in humans suggests that oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in the development of the capacity to form social bonds, the mediation of the positive aspects of early-life nurturing on adult bonding capacity, and the maintenance of social bonding. Here, we focus on the extensive research on a socially monogamous rodent model organism, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). OT facilitates mating-induced pair bonds in adults through interaction with the mesolimbic dopamine system. Variation in striatal OT receptor density predicts resilience and susceptibility to neonatal social neglect in female prairie voles. Finally, in adults, loss of a partner results in multiple disruptions in OT signaling, including decreased OT release in the striatum, which is caused by an activation of the brain corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system. The dramatic behavioral consequence of partner loss is increased depressive-like behavior reminiscent of bereavement. Importantly, infusions of OT into the striatum of adults prevents the onset of depressive-like behavior following partner loss, and evoking endogenous OT release using melanocortin agonists during neonatal social isolation rescues impairments in social bonding in adulthood. This work has important translational implications relevant to the disruptions of social bonds in childhood and in adults.",28812266,2017,Oxytocin and Social Relationships: From Attachment to Bond Disruption.
59,"In this chapter, we introduce a new area of social pharmacology that encompasses the study of the role of neuromodulators in modulating a wide range of social behaviors and brain function, with the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors. There are increasing evidences for the role of the neuropeptide oxytocin in modulating a wide range of social behaviors, in reducing anxiety, and in impacting the social brain network. Oxytocin also promotes social functions in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and reduces anxiety and fear in anxiety disorders. In this chapter, we will emphasize the importance of integrating basic research and clinical human research in determining optimal strategies for drug discoveries for social dysfunctions and anxiety disorders. We will highlight the significance of adopting a precision medicine approach to optimize targeted treatments with oxytocin in neuropsychiatry. Oxytocin effects on social behavior and brain function can vary from one individual to another based on external factors, such as heterogeneity in autism phenotype, childhood experiences, personality, attachment style, and oxytocin receptor polymorphisms. Hence, targeted therapies for subgroups of patients can help alleviating some of the core symptoms and lead to a better future for these patients and their families.",28812273,2017,A Precision Medicine Approach to Oxytocin Trials.
60,"OBJECTIVES
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) promotes numerous psychological benefits, but few studies have identified for whom MBSR is most effective. The current study tested the hypothesis that lower baseline mindfulness invites more ""room to grow"" and, thus, predicts greater improvement during MBSR.


METHOD
We examined three facets of mindfulness (awareness, acceptance, decentering) among 131 MBSR participants prior to enrollment, to test the hypothesis that lower baseline mindfulness predicts greater improvements in perceived stress, positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA) following MBSR.


RESULTS
Lower acceptance and decentering predicted greater decreases in perceived stress. Higher awareness, acceptance, and decentering predicted greater increases in PA. Higher awareness predicted greater reductions in NA. Lower decentering predicted greater reductions in NA.

Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Differences in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of α-synuclein aggregation disorders including PD.


OBJECTIVES
To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals.


METHODS
Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms.


CONCLUSION
Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. © 2017 The Authors.

In this cross-sectional study, we used data on 3656 Swedish children aged three to five years living in intact families, JPC, mostly with one parent or single care. Linear regression analyses were conducted with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, completed by parents and preschool teachers, as the outcome measure.


RESULTS
Children in JPC showed less psychological problems than those living mostly (adjusted B 1.81; 95% CI [0.66 to 2.95]) or only with one parent (adjusted B 1.94; 95% CI [0.75 to 3.13]), in parental reports.

63,"The heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme heparanase promotes the progression of many cancers by driving tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Heparanase accomplishes this via multiple mechanisms including its recently described effect on enhancing biogenesis of tumor exosomes. Because we recently discovered that heparanase expression is upregulated in myeloma cells that survive chemotherapy, we were prompted to investigate the impact of anti-myeloma drugs on exosome biogenesis. When myeloma cells were exposed to the commonly utilized anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib or melphalan, exosome secretion by the cells was dramatically enhanced. These chemotherapy-induced exosomes (chemoexosomes) have a proteome profile distinct from cells not exposed to drug including a dramatic elevation in the level of heparanase present as exosome cargo. The chemoexosome heparanase was not found inside the chemoexosome, but was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an extracellular matrix. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their heparan sulfate degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-α, an important myeloma growth factor. Moreover, chemoexosomes stimulated macrophage migration and this effect was blocked by H1023, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. These data suggest that anti-myeloma therapy ignites a burst of exosomes having a high level of heparanase that remodels extracellular matrix and alters tumor and host cell behaviors that likely contribute to chemoresistance and eventual patient relapse.


SUMMARY
We find that anti-myeloma chemotherapy dramatically stimulates secretion of exosomes and alters exosome composition. Exosomes secreted during therapy contain high levels of heparanase on their surface that can degrade ECM and also can be transferred to both tumor and host cells, altering their behavior in ways that may enhance tumor survival and progression.",28888912,2018,Chemotherapy induces secretion of exosomes loaded with heparanase that degrades extracellular matrix and impacts tumor and host cell behavior.
64,"During morphogenesis and cancer metastasis, grouped cells migrate through tissues of dissimilar stiffness. Although the influence of matrix stiffness on cellular mechanosensitivity and motility are well-recognized, it remains unknown whether these matrix-dependent cellular features persist after cells move to a new microenvironment. Here, we interrogate whether priming of epithelial cells by a given matrix stiffness influences their future collective migration on a different matrix - a property we refer to as the 'mechanical memory' of migratory cells. To prime cells on a defined matrix and track their collective migration onto an adjoining secondary matrix of dissimilar stiffness, we develop a modular polyacrylamide substrate through step-by-step polymerization of different PA compositions. We report that epithelial cells primed on a stiff matrix migrate faster, display higher actomyosin expression, form larger focal adhesions, and retain nuclear YAP even after arriving onto a soft secondary matrix, as compared to their control behavior on a homogeneously soft matrix. Priming on a soft ECM causes a reverse effect. The depletion of YAP dramatically reduces this memory-dependent migration. Our results present a previously unidentified regulation of mechanosensitive collective cell migration by past matrix stiffness, in which mechanical memory depends on YAP activity.",28918264,2017,Past matrix stiffness primes epithelial cells and regulates their future collective migration through a mechanical memory.

66,"Climate change represents a primary threat to species persistence and biodiversity at a global scale. Cold adapted alpine species are especially sensitive to climate change and can offer key ""early warning signs"" about deleterious effects of predicted change. Among mountain ungulates, survival, a key determinant of demographic performance, may be influenced by future climate in complex, and possibly opposing ways. Demographic data collected from 447 mountain goats in 10 coastal Alaska, USA, populations over a 37-year time span indicated that survival is highest during low snowfall winters and cool summers. However, general circulation models (GCMs) predict future increase in summer temperature and decline in winter snowfall. To disentangle how these opposing climate-driven effects influence mountain goat populations, we developed an age-structured population model to project mountain goat population trajectories for 10 different GCM/emissions scenarios relevant for coastal Alaska. Projected increases in summer temperature had stronger negative effects on population trajectories than the positive demographic effects of reduced winter snowfall. In 5 of the 10 GCM/representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, the net effect of projected climate change was extinction over a 70-year time window (2015-2085); smaller initial populations were more likely to go extinct faster than larger populations. Using a resource selection modeling approach, we determined that distributional shifts to higher elevation (i.e., ""thermoneutral"") summer range was unlikely to be a viable behavioral adaptation strategy; due to the conical shape of mountains, summer range was expected to decline by 17%-86% for 7 of the 10 GCM/RCP scenarios. Projected declines of mountain goat populations are driven by climate-linked bottom-up mechanisms and may have wide ranging implications for alpine ecosystems.

Few studies have examined factors that moderate the relationship between playing video games and adolescent psychological adjustment. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology in a sample of 441 11th and 12th grade students, while considering both gender and the social context (whether they played alone or with others).


METHODS
Participants (66% non-Hispanic White) were administered a survey (including measures of technology use and anxiety symptomatology) in school at baseline and one year later.


RESULTS
Both gender and the social context moderated the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology. Boys who played video games the most had the lowest levels of anxiety, whereas girls who played video games the most had the highest levels of anxiety. This relationship was exacerbated in the context of playing with others.


LIMITATIONS
Although the study has a number of strengths including the longitudinal design and the diverse sample, the study relied on self-report data.

69,"Fire can influence the microclimate of forest habitats by removing understory vegetation and surface debris. Temperature is often higher in recently burned forests owing to increased light penetration through the open understory. Because physiological processes are sensitive to temperature in ectotherms, we expected fire-maintained forests to improve the suitability of the thermal environment for turtles, and for turtles to seasonally associate with the most thermally-optimal habitats. Using a laboratory thermal gradient, we determined the thermal preference range (Tset) of eastern box turtles, Terrapene carolina, to be 27-31°C. Physical models simulating the body temperatures experienced by turtles in the field revealed that surface environments in a fire-maintained longleaf pine forest were 3°C warmer than adjacent unburned mixed hardwood/pine forests, but the fire-maintained forest was never of superior thermal quality owing to wider Te fluctuations above Tset and exposure to extreme and potentially lethal temperatures. Radiotracked turtles using fire-managed longleaf pine forests maintained shell temperatures (Ts) approximately 2°C above those at a nearby unburned forest, but we observed only moderate seasonal changes in habitat use which were inconsistent with thermoregulatory behavior. We conclude that turtles were not responding strongly to the thermal heterogeneity generated by fire in our system, and that other aspects of the environment are likely more important in shaping habitat associations.",29037402,2017,Thermal biology of eastern box turtles in a longleaf pine system managed with prescribed fire.
70,"The terrestrial carbon (C) cycle has been commonly represented by a series of C balance equations to track C influxes into and effluxes out of individual pools in earth system models (ESMs). This representation matches our understanding of C cycle processes well but makes it difficult to track model behaviors. It is also computationally expensive, limiting the ability to conduct comprehensive parametric sensitivity analyses. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a matrix approach, which reorganizes the C balance equations in the original ESM into one matrix equation without changing any modeled C cycle processes and mechanisms. We applied the matrix approach to the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) with vertically-resolved biogeochemistry. The matrix equation exactly reproduces litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics of the standard CLM4.5 across different spatial-temporal scales. The matrix approach enables effective diagnosis of system properties such as C residence time and attribution of global change impacts to relevant processes. We illustrated, for example, the impacts of CO2 fertilization on litter and SOC dynamics can be easily decomposed into the relative contributions from C input, allocation of external C into different C pools, nitrogen regulation, altered soil environmental conditions, and vertical mixing along the soil profile. In addition, the matrix tool can accelerate model spin-up, permit thorough parametric sensitivity tests, enable pool-based data assimilation, and facilitate tracking and benchmarking of model behaviors.

We searched MEDLINE® and Embase® from January 1998 to March 2017. Studies were included if they were written in English, contained original data, pertained to a U.S. population, and identified a determinant associated with overuse of imaging in the ED.


RESULTS
Twenty relevant studies were included. Fourteen evaluated computerized tomography (CT) scanning in patents presenting to a regional ED who were then transferred to a level 1 trauma center; incomplete transfer of data and poor image quality were the most frequently described reasons for repeat scanning. Unnecessary pre-transfer scanning or repeated scanning after transfer, in multiple studies, was highest among older patients, those with higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS) and those being transferred further. Six studies explored determinants of overused imaging in the ED in varied conditions, with overuse greater in older patients and those having more comorbid diseases. Defensive imaging reportedly influenced physician behavior. Less integration of services across the health system also predisposed to overuse of imaging.


CONCLUSIONS
The literature is heterogeneous with surprisingly few studies of determinants of imaging in minor head injury or of spine imaging. Older patient age and higher ISS were the most consistently associated with ED imaging overuse. This review highlights the need for precise definitions of overuse of imaging in the ED.",29100783,2018,Factors associated with imaging overuse in the emergency department: A systematic review.
72,"Increases in atmospheric CO2 levels and associated ocean changes are expected to have dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems. Although the Southern Ocean is experiencing some of the fastest rates of change, few studies have explored how Antarctic fishes may be affected by co-occurring ocean changes, and even fewer have examined early life stages. To date, no studies have characterized potential trade-offs in physiology and behavior in response to projected multiple climate change stressors (ocean acidification and warming) on Antarctic fishes. We exposed juvenile emerald rockcod Trematomus bernacchii to three PCO2 treatments (~450, ~850, and ~1,200 μatm PCO2 ) at two temperatures (-1 or 2°C). After 2, 7, 14, and 28 days, metrics of physiological performance including cardiorespiratory function (heart rate [fH ] and ventilation rate [fV ]), metabolic rate (M˙O2), and cellular enzyme activity were measured. Behavioral responses, including scototaxis, activity, exploration, and escape response were assessed after 7 and 14 days. Elevated PCO2 independently had little impact on either physiology or behavior in juvenile rockcod, whereas warming resulted in significant changes across acclimation time. After 14 days, fH , fV and M˙O2 significantly increased with warming, but not with elevated PCO2 . Increased physiological costs were accompanied by behavioral alterations including increased dark zone preference up to 14%, reduced activity by 12%, as well as reduced escape time suggesting potential trade-offs in energetics. After 28 days, juvenile rockcod demonstrated a degree of temperature compensation as fV , M˙O2, and cellular metabolism significantly decreased following the peak at 14 days; however, temperature compensation was only evident in the absence of elevated PCO2 . Sustained increases in fV and M˙O2 after 28 days exposure to elevated PCO2 indicate additive (fV ) and synergistic (M˙O2) interactions occurred in combination with warming. Stressor-induced energetic trade-offs in physiology and behavior may be an important mechanism leading to vulnerability of Antarctic fishes to future ocean change.",29155460,2018,Antarctic emerald rockcod have the capacity to compensate for warming when uncoupled from CO2 -acidification.
73,"Marine megafauna, including seabirds, are critically affected by fisheries bycatch. However, bycatch risk may differ on temporal and spatial scales due to the uneven distribution and effort of fleets operating different fishing gear, and to focal species distribution and foraging behavior. Scopoli's shearwater Calonectris diomedea is a long-lived seabird that experiences high bycatch rates in longline fisheries and strong population-level impacts due to this type of anthropogenic mortality. Analyzing a long-term dataset on individual monitoring, we compared adult survival (by means of multi-event capture-recapture models) among three close predator-free Mediterranean colonies of the species. Unexpectedly for a long-lived organism, adult survival varied among colonies. We explored potential causes of this differential survival by (1) measuring egg volume as a proxy of food availability and parental condition; (2) building a specific longline bycatch risk map for the species; and (3) assessing the distribution patterns of breeding birds from the three study colonies via GPS tracking. Egg volume was very similar between colonies over time, suggesting that environmental variability related to habitat foraging suitability was not the main cause of differential survival. On the other hand, differences in foraging movements among individuals from the three colonies expose them to differential mortality risk, which likely influenced the observed differences in adult survival. The overlap of information obtained by the generation of specific bycatch risk maps, the quantification of population demographic parameters, and the foraging spatial analysis should inform managers about differential sensitivity to the anthropogenic impact at mesoscale level and guide decisions depending on the spatial configuration of local populations. The approach would apply and should be considered in any species where foraging distribution is colony-specific and mortality risk varies spatially.",29178374,2018,Differential adult survival at close seabird colonies: The importance of spatial foraging segregation and bycatch risk during the breeding season.
74,"Spontaneous fluctuations in hemodynamic signals in the absence of a task or overt stimulation are used to infer neural activity. We tested this coupling by simultaneously measuring neural activity and changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the somatosensory cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during periods of true rest and during whisker stimulation and volitional whisking. We found that neurovascular coupling was similar across states and that large, spontaneous CBV changes in the absence of sensory input were driven by volitional whisker and body movements. Hemodynamic signals during periods of rest were weakly correlated with neural activity. Spontaneous fluctuations in CBV and vessel diameter persisted when local neural spiking and glutamatergic input were blocked, as well as during blockade of noradrenergic receptors, suggesting a non-neuronal origin for spontaneous CBV fluctuations. Spontaneous hemodynamic signals reflect a combination of behavior, local neural activity, and putatively non-neural processes.",29184204,2017,Weak correlations between hemodynamic signals and ongoing neural activity during the resting state.
75,"Violence takes many forms, including intimate partner violence, sexual violence, child abuse and neglect, bullying, suicidal behavior, and elder abuse and neglect. These forms of violence are interconnected and often share the same root causes. They can also co-occur together in families and communities and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life. Often, due to a variety of factors, separate, ""siloed"" approaches are used to address each form of violence. However, understanding and implementing approaches that prevent and address the overlapping root causes of violence (risk factors) and promote factors that increase the resilience of people and communities (protective factors) can help practitioners more effectively and efficiently use limited resources to prevent multiple forms of violence and save lives. This article presents approaches used by 2 state health departments, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, to integrate a shared risk and protective factor approach into their violence prevention work and identifies key lessons learned that may serve to inform crosscutting violence prevention efforts in other states.",29189502,2018,Connecting the Dots: State Health Department Approaches to Addressing Shared Risk and Protective Factors Across Multiple Forms of Violence.
76,"Repeated exposure to cocaine produces structural and functional modifications at synapses from neurons in several brain regions including the nucleus accumbens. These changes are thought to underlie cocaine-induced sensitization. The ubiquitin proteasome system plays a crucial role in the remodeling of synapses and has recently been implicated in addiction-related behavior. The ATPase Rpt6 subunit of the 26S proteasome is phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II alpha at ser120 which is thought to regulate proteasome activity and distribution in neurons. Here, we demonstrate that Rpt6 phosphorylation is involved in cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Cocaine concomitantly increases proteasome activity and Rpt6 S120 phosphorylation in cultured neurons and in various brain regions of wild type mice including the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. In contrast, cocaine does not increase proteasome activity in Rpt6 phospho-mimetic (ser120Asp) mice. Strikingly, we found a complete absence of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization in the Rpt6 ser120Asp mice. Together, these findings suggest a critical role for Rpt6 phosphorylation and proteasome function in the regulation cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity.",29217409,2017,Proteasome phosphorylation regulates cocaine-induced sensitization.
77,"Ohtahara syndrome, also known as type 4 of Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with suppression bursts (EIEE-4) is currently an untreatable disorder that presents with seizures and impaired cognition. EIEE-4 patients have mutations most frequently in the STXBP1 gene encoding a Sec protein, munc18-1. The exact molecular mechanism of how these munc18-1 mutations cause impaired cognition, remains elusive. The leading haploinsufficiency hypothesis posits that mutations in munc18-1 render the protein unstable leading to its degradation. Expression driven by the healthy allele is not sufficient to maintain the physiological function resulting in haploinsufficiency. The aim of this study has been to understand how munc18-1 haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4. Here we present results from behavioral to cellular effects from a mouse model of munc18-1 haploinsufficiency. Munc18-1 heterozygous knock-out mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory in behavior tests as well as reduced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation. Cultured munc18-1 heterozygous hippocampal neurons had significantly slower rate of synaptic vesicle release and decreased readily releasable vesicle pool compared to wild-type control neurons in fluorescent FM dye assays. These results demonstrate that reduced munc18-1 levels are sufficient to impair learning and memory by reducing neurotransmitter release. Therefore, our study implicates munc18-1 haploinsufficiency as a primary cause of cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4 patients.",29217410,2017,Munc18-1 haploinsufficiency impairs learning and memory by reduced synaptic vesicular release in a model of Ohtahara syndrome.
78,"Sleepwalking is a disorder characterized by complex motor behaviors arising from slow wave sleep usually occurring in children. The adult onset of sleepwalking suggests the presence of an external precipitating factor leading to the occurrence of the disorder. Hyperthyroidism has been reported to be the possible cause of sleepwalking in a few cases. We present the case of a 36-year-old man who reported a sudden appearance of nocturnal episodes of sleepwalking. He underwent a complete video polysomnography (VPSG), which showed a polygraphic pattern arising from stage N3 sleep related to the presence of simple motor behaviors. Routine blood tests showed a mild hyperthyroidism. After 4 months of thyrostatic treatment, the patient reported no more sleepwalking events. A VPSG performed at the last follow-up showed the absence of pathological electroclinical events arising from stage N3 sleep. Therefore, we hypothesize that there is a link between sleepwalking and thyroid dysfunction in our patient.",29246269,2018,Adult-Onset Sleepwalking Secondary to Hyperthyroidism: Polygraphic Evidence.
79,"Chendytes lawi, an extinct flightless diving anseriform from coastal California, was traditionally classified as a sea duck, tribe Mergini, based on similarities in osteological characters. We recover and analyze mitochondrial genomes of C. lawi and five additional Mergini species, including the extinct Labrador Duck, Camptorhynchus labradorius. Despite its diving morphology, C. lawi is reconstructed as an ancient relictual lineage basal to the dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini), revealing an additional example of convergent evolution of characters related to feeding behavior among ducks. The Labrador Duck is sister to Steller's Eider which may provide insights into the evolution and ecology of this poorly known extinct species. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of full length mitogenomes, from taxonomically distributed ancient and modern sources can improve phylogeny reconstruction of groups previously assessed with shorter single-gene mitochondrial sequences.",29247849,2017,Mitogenomics supports an unexpected taxonomic relationship for the extinct diving duck Chendytes lawi and definitively places the extinct Labrador Duck.
80,"Both social perception and temperament in young infants have been related to social functioning later in life. Previous functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2009) showed larger blood-oxygenation changes for social compared to non-social stimuli in the posterior temporal cortex of five-month-old infants. We sought to replicate and extend these findings by using fNIRS to study the neural basis of social perception in relation to infant temperament (Negative Affect) in 37 five-to-eight-month-old infants. Infants watched short videos displaying either hand and facial movements of female actors (social dynamic condition) or moving toys and machinery (non-social dynamic condition), while fNIRS data were collected over temporal brain regions. Negative Affect was measured using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Results showed significantly larger blood-oxygenation changes in the right posterior-temporal region in the social compared to the non-social condition. Furthermore, this differential activation was smaller in infants showing higher Negative Affect. Our results replicate those of Lloyd-Fox et al. and confirmed that five-to-eight-month-old infants show cortical specialization for social perception. Furthermore, the decreased cortical sensitivity to social stimuli in infants showing high Negative Affect may be an early biomarker for later difficulties in social interaction.",29248823,2017,Negative affect is related to reduced differential neural responses to social and non-social stimuli in 5-to-8-month-old infants: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy-study.
81,"Alcohol problems have variable outcomes for marital relationships depending on whether drinking patterns are concordant or discordant among the members of the dyad; however, it is unclear what impact these variations in drinking patterns have on children. The current study was designed to explore several gaps and limitations in the parent heavy drinking literature. In particular, the prospective associations over 3years between parent heavy drinking, parenting, and child externalizing behavior were investigated in an integrated model to examine the influence of concordant and discordant drinking within couples on subsequent outcomes for their children. The study consisted of 180 couples recruited by mailings with children primarily between the ages of 4 and 11years old (52% male children). Parent-report of marital conflict, parenting, alcohol use, and child externalizing behavior were measured in a longitudinal study. Actor-Partner Interdependence Model analyses were conducted. Higher levels of maladaptive parenting were associated with higher externalizing for children of concordant drinking couples as opposed to discordant drinking couples. Implications for research and practice are discussed, including investigating mediators and moderators of the current findings such as quality of the parent-child relationship.",29253661,2018,Parents' concordant and discordant alcohol use and subsequent child behavioral outcomes.
82,"This study was designed to develop a risk assessment chart for the clinical management and prevention of the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Iranian population, which is vital for developing national prevention programs. The Isfahan Cohort Study (ICS) is a population-based prospective study of 6504 Iranian adults ≥35 years old, followed-up for ten years, from 2001 to 2010. Behavioral and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined every five years, while biennial follow-ups for the occurrence of the events was performed by phone calls or by verbal autopsy. Among these participants, 5432 (2784 women, 51.3%) were CVD free at baseline examination and had at least one follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to predict the risk of ischemic CVD events, including sudden cardiac death due to unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The model fit statistics such as area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC), calibration chi-square and the overall bias were used to assess the model performance. We also tested the Framingham model for comparison. Seven hundred and five CVD events occurred during 49452.8 person-years of follow-up. The event probabilities were calculated and presented color-coded on each gender-specific PARS chart. The AUROC and Harrell's C indices were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72-0.76) and 0.73, respectively. In the calibration, the Nam-D'Agostino χ2 was 10.82 (p = 0.29). The overall bias of the proposed model was 95.60%. PARS model was also internally validated using cross-validation. The Android app and the Web-based risk assessment tool were also developed as to have an impact on public health. In comparison, the refitted and recalibrated Framingham models, estimated the CVD incidence with the overall bias of 149.60% and 128.23% for men, and 222.70% and 176.07% for women, respectively. In conclusion, the PARS risk assessment chart is a simple, accurate, and well-calibrated tool for predicting a 10-year risk of CVD occurrence in Iranian population and can be used in an attempt to develop national guidelines for the CVD management.",29261727,2017,PARS risk charts: A 10-year study of risk assessment for cardiovascular diseases in Eastern Mediterranean Region.
83,"BACKGROUND
Self-report measures are used to evaluate surgery outcome but are not necessarily indicative of actual disabilities.


RESEARCH QUESTION
The aim of the present study was to determine the association between self-report assessments of quality of life and objective measures of function in patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative disease. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of lumbar spinal fusion surgery on this relationship.


METHODS
Before and 6 month after surgery 26 patients completed self-report questionnaires and assessments of 3D gait analysis and trunk range of motion (ROM) during standing.


RESULTS
Before surgery, questionnaires were not correlated with any of the gait parameters and with only 2 trunk ROM parameters. Six month after surgery, the questionnaires showed 12 significant correlations with gait parameters and 19 with trunk ROM parameters. A better Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (r = 0.464, p = .026), EQ-5D (r = -0.440, p = .036), and EQ VAS (r = -0.472, p = .023) score were correlated with a reduced anterior thorax tilt during walking. Maximum forward flexion of the trunk during standing was correlated with a better EQ-5D (r = 0.684, p = .001) and ODI (r = -0.560, p = .008) score as well as with reduced pain scores.


SIGNIFICANCE
The lack of association between self-reported questionnaires and objective measures of function before surgery was likely due to psychological distress, correlating with emotional and cognitive function rather than true functional capacities. The influence of these psychological factors might be reduced after surgery due to a reduction of low back pain. To obtain an accurate assessment of impairment, there is a need to evaluate function by measuring objective physiologic parameters that are unsusceptible to voluntary or affective influences.",29287206,2017,Effect of lumbar spinal fusion surgery on the association of self-report measures with objective measures of physical function.
84,"PURPOSE
Although many factors have been proposed to trigger symptom exacerbations (flares) in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, few studies have investigated these factors empirically. Therefore, we embedded a case-crossover study in the MAPP (Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain) longitudinal study to evaluate a range of patient reported triggers.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We assessed exposure to proposed triggers, including diet, physical activities, sedentary behaviors, stress, sexual activities, infection-like symptoms and allergies, by questionnaire a maximum of 3 times when participants reported flares and at 3 randomly selected times. We compared participant preflare to nonflare exposures by conditional logistic regression.


RESULTS
In our full analytical sample of 292 participants only 2 factors, including recent sexual activity (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.96) and urinary tract infection symptoms (OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.02-5.68), which may overlap with those of flares, were associated with flare onset. On subanalyses restricted to flares with specific suspected triggers additional positive associations were observed for some factors such as certain dietary factors, abdominal muscle exercises, and vaginal infection-like symptoms and fever, but not for other factors (eg stress).


CONCLUSIONS
Except for sexual activity our findings suggest that patient reported triggers may be individual or group specific, or they may not contribute to flares. These findings suggest caution in following rigid, global flare prevention strategies and support additional research to develop evidence-based strategies.",29288643,2017,A Case-Crossover Study of Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome Flare Triggers in the MAPP Research Network.

Traditional extracellular recordings have been powerful and scalable, but much less is known about the intracellular processes that lead to spiking activity. We present a robotic system, the multipatcher, capable of automatically obtaining blind whole-cell patch clamp recordings from multiple neurons simultaneously. The multipatcher significantly extends automated patch clamping, or 'autopatching', to guide four interacting electrodes in a coordinated fashion, avoiding mechanical coupling in the brain. We demonstrate its performance in the cortex of anesthetized and awake mice. A multipatcher with four electrodes took an average of 10 min to obtain dual or triple recordings in 29% of trials in anesthetized mice, and in 18% of the trials in awake mice, thus illustrating practical yield and throughput to obtain multiple, simultaneous whole-cell recordings in vivo.",29297466,2018,Multi-neuron intracellular recording in vivo via interacting autopatching robots.
86,"BACKGROUND
Hand hygiene and aseptic techniques are essential preventives in combating hospital-acquired infections. However, implementation of these strategies in the operating room remains suboptimal. There is a paucity of intervention studies providing detailed information on effective methods for change. This study aimed to evaluate the process of implementing a theory-driven knowledge translation program for improved use of hand hygiene and aseptic techniques in the operating room.


METHODS
The study was set in an operating department of a university hospital. The intervention was underpinned by theories on organizational learning, culture and person centeredness. Qualitative process data were collected via participant observations and analyzed using a thematic approach.


RESULTS
Doubts that hand-hygiene practices are effective in preventing hospital acquired infections, strong boundaries and distrust between professional groups and a lack of psychological safety were identified as barriers towards change. Facilitated interprofessional dialogue and learning in ""safe spaces"" worked as mechanisms for motivation and engagement. Allowing for the free expression of different opinions, doubts and viewing resistance as a natural part of any change was effective in engaging all professional categories in co-creation of clinical relevant solutions to improve hand hygiene.


CONCLUSION
Enabling nurses and physicians to think and talk differently about hospital acquired infections and hand hygiene requires a shift from the concept of one-way directed compliance towards change and learning as the result of a participatory and meaning-making process.

87,"Many neuroscience questions center around understanding how the molecules and wiring in neural circuits mechanistically yield behavioral functions, or go awry in disease states. However, mapping the molecules and wiring of neurons across the large scales of neural circuits has posed a great challenge. We recently developed expansion microscopy (ExM), a process in which we physically magnify biological specimens such as brain circuits. We synthesize throughout preserved brain specimens a dense, even mesh of a swellable polymer such as sodium polyacrylate, anchoring key biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids to the polymer. After mechanical homogenization of the specimen-polymer composite, we add water, and the polymer swells, pulling biomolecules apart. Due to the larger separation between molecules, ordinary microscopes can then perform nanoscale resolution imaging. We here review the ExM technology as well as applications to the mapping of synapses, cells, and circuits, including deployment in species such as Drosophila, mouse, non-human primate, and human.",29316506,2018,Expansion microscopy: development and neuroscience applications.
88,"Sexual violence is both a major human rights issue and an important driver of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. While quantitative indicators of sexual violence have evolved to facilitate cross-national comparison and country-level decision making, qualitative findings typically remain constrained to single sites and populations. We analyzed social representations of sexual violence, specifically rape, in a sample of 1446 narratives about HIV written by young Africans between 2005 and 2014. The narratives were written at 5 discrete time points (2005, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2014) by equal numbers of males and females aged 10-24 in urban and rural areas of Swaziland, Kenya, South-East Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Senegal. We combined three analytical approaches: descriptive statistics of quantifiable characteristics of the narratives, thematic data analysis, and a narrative-based approach. Violent rapes by strangers occur in all country samples, but in Nigerian narratives the 'immoral' behavior of female characters facilitates these attacks. Swazi narratives, in contrast, often depict familial rapes that include disclosure and service seeking as key components of the rape scenario. The social representations found in the narrative data reflect rape myths, which, at the socio-cultural level, serve to trivialize sexual violence by minimizing or justifying aggression, thus shifting blame to victims and absolving perpetrators of blame. Additionally, these social representations conflict with self-report data from Violence Against Children surveys conducted in Swaziland (2007), Kenya (2010) and Nigeria (2014) in that they depict perpetrators primarily as strangers or family members as opposed to romantic partners; however, social representations and self-report concur regarding barriers to disclosure and service seeking for victims. The Swazi narratives offer potential models for the framing of sexual violence in ways that promote disclosure and support for survivors and counteract harmful rape myths.",29316511,2017,"Young Africans' social representations of rape in their HIV-related creative narratives, 2005-2014: Rape myths and alternative narratives."
89,"The literature has long emphasized the role of higher cortical structures in endogenous orienting. Based on evolutionary explanation and previous data, we explored the possibility that lower monocular channels may also have a functional role in endogenous orienting of attention. Sensitive behavioral manipulation was used to probe the contribution of monocularly segregated regions in a simple cue - target detection task. A central spatially informative cue, and its ensuing target, were presented to the same or different eyes at varying cue-target intervals. Results indicated that the onset of endogenous orienting was apparent earlier when the cue and target were presented to the same eye. The data provides converging evidence for the notion that endogenous facilitation is modulated by monocular portions of the visual stream. This, in turn, suggests that higher cortical mechanisms are not exclusively responsible for endogenous orienting, and that a dynamic interaction between higher and lower neural levels, might be involved.",29317323,2018,Monocular channels have a functional role in endogenous orienting.
90,"BACKGROUND
The recent scale-up of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services has rapidly accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake among pregnant and postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa. The Mother and Infant Retention for Health (MIR4Health) study evaluates the impact of a combination intervention administered by trained lay health workers to decrease attrition among HIV-positive women initiating PMTCT services and their infants through 6 months postpartum.


METHODS
This was a qualitative study nested within the MIR4Health trial. MIR4Health was conducted at 10 health facilities in Nyanza, Kenya from September 2013 to September 2015. The trial intervention addressed behavioral, social, and structural barriers to PMTCT retention and included: appointment reminders via text and phone calls, follow-up and tracking for missed clinic visits, PMTCT health education at home visits and during clinic visits, and retention and adherence support and counseling. All interventions were administered by lay health workers. We describe results of a nested small qualitative inquiry which conducted two focus groups to assess the experiences and perceptions of lay health workers administering the interventions. Discussions were recorded and simultaneously transcribed and translated into English. Data were analyzed using framework analysis approach.


RESULTS
Study findings show lay health workers played a critical role supporting mothers in PMTCT services across a range of behavioral, social, and structural domains, including improved communication and contact, health education, peer support, and patient advocacy and assistance. Findings also identified barriers to the uptake and implementation of the interventions, such as concerns about privacy and stigma, and the limitations of the healthcare system including healthcare worker attitudes. Overall, study findings indicate that lay health workers found the interventions to be feasible, acceptable, and well received by clients.


CONCLUSIONS
Lay health workers played a fundamental role in supporting mothers engaged in PMTCT services and provided valuable feedback on the implementation of PMTCT interventions. Future interventions must include strategies to ensure client privacy, decrease stigma within communities, and address the practical limitations of health systems. This study adds important insight to the growing body of research on lay health worker experiences in HIV and PMTCT care.

Safety analysis of probiotic bacteria is an obligatory characteristic to be evaluated prior to application in food or pharmacological products. This study was designed to evaluate in vitro and in vivo safety parameters of Enterococcus faecium 2C strain, a probiotic candidate isolated from human breast milk.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
E.faecium 2C was studied for its hemolytic activity and phenotypic antibiotics resistance profile. In vivo safety of the mentioned Enterococcus strain was studied by determining acute oral toxicity in Wistar Male rats. The animals were randomly divided into two groups of 3 animals each. The test group animals were gavaged daily with bacterial dose of 1 × 1011 CFU/kg of animal body weight for 21 consecutive days. The animals in control group received normal basal diet without any supplementations. Hematological and biochemical parameters, organ weight, body weight and common health features of the animals were recorded.


RESULTS
E.faecium 2C appeared non-hemolytic and sensitive to the majority of the tested antibiotics. The Wistar male rats fed orally with the mentioned bacterial suspensions survived the test period, and showed normal growth and development. No adverse effects on the general health condition, behavior, and growth were seen in the treated animals compared to control group. Additionally, no significant changes in the hematological results, blood biochemistry, organ weights and histopathology of the rats in treatment groups were observed. None of the vital organs of the treated animals showed signs of bacteremia or infectivity.

93,"In a verbal fluency task, a person is required to produce as many exemplars of a given category (e.g., 'animals', or words starting with 'f') as possible within a fixed duration. Successful verbal fluency performance relies both on the depth of search within semantic/phonological neighborhoods ('clustering') and the ability to flexibly disengage between exhausted clusters ('switching'). Convergent evidence from functional imaging and neuropsychology suggests that cluster-switch behaviors engage dissociable brain regions. Switching has been linked to a frontoparietal network dedicated to executive functioning and controlled lexical retrieval, whereas clustering is more commonly associated with temporal lobe regions dedicated to semantic and phonological processing. Here we attempted to modulate cluster-switch dynamics among neurotypical adults (N = 24) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) delivered at three sites: a) anterior temporal cortex; b) frontal cortex; and c) temporoparietal cortex. Participants completed letter-guided and semantic category verbal fluency tasks pre/post stimulation. Cathodal stimulation of anterior temporal cortex facilitated the total number of words generated and the number of words generated within clusters during semantic category verbal fluency.

94,"Psychological construction models of emotion state that emotions are variable concepts constructed by fundamental psychological processes, whereas according to basic emotion theory, emotions cannot be divided into more fundamental units and each basic emotion is represented by a unique and innate neural circuitry. In a previous study, we found evidence for the psychological construction account by showing that several brain regions were commonly activated when perceiving different emotions (i.e. a general emotion network). Moreover, this set of brain regions included areas associated with core affect, conceptualization and executive control, as predicted by psychological construction models. Here we investigate directed functional brain connectivity in the same dataset to address two questions: 1) is there a common pathway within the general emotion network for the perception of different emotions and 2) if so, does this common pathway contain information to distinguish between different emotions? We used generalized psychophysiological interactions and information flow indices to examine the connectivity within the general emotion network. The results revealed a general emotion pathway that connects neural nodes involved in core affect, conceptualization, language and executive control. Perception of different emotions could not be accurately classified based on the connectivity patterns from the nodes of the general emotion pathway. Successful classification was achieved when connections outside the general emotion pathway were included. We propose that the general emotion pathway functions as a common pathway within the general emotion network and is involved in shared basic psychological processes across emotions. However, additional connections within the general emotion network are required to classify different emotions, consistent with a constructionist account.",29339312,2018,Studying emotion theories through connectivity analysis: Evidence from generalized psychophysiological interactions and graph theory.
95,"The association between stress and mental illness has been well documented, but the molecular consequences of repeated exposure to stress have not been completely identified. The present study sought to elucidate the combinatorial effects of early-life maternal separation stress and adult social defeat stress on alterations in signal transduction and gene expression that have been previously implicated in susceptibility to psychosocial stress. Molecular analyses were performed in the prelimbic/infralimbic cortex, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, three brain regions that have been suggested to play critical roles in determining stress responses. The current data reveal that both maternal separation and social defeat significantly impact the expression of genes involved in histone methylation and the β-catenin-, endogenous opioid-, neurotrophin-, and glucocorticoid signaling pathways. Although the effects of maternal separation and social defeat were largely non-overlapping, a subset of genes in each brain region were governed by additive, opposing, or other types of interactions between these stress paradigms, thus highlighting potential molecular mechanisms through which these stressors might coordinately regulate brain function and behavior.",29341883,2018,Brain-region-specific Molecular Responses to Maternal Separation and Social Defeat Stress in Mice.
96,"Au-methotrexate (Au-MTX) conjugates induced by sugar molecules were produced by a simple, one-pot, hydrothermal growth method. Herein, the Au(III)-MTX complexes were used as the precursors to form Au-MTX conjugates. Addition of different types of sugar molecules with abundant hydroxyl groups resulted in the formation of Au-MTX conjugates featuring distinct characteristics that could be explained by the diverse capping mechanisms of sugar molecules. That is, the instant-capping mechanism of glucose favored the generation of peanut-like Au-MTX conjugates with high colloidal stability while the post-capping mechanism of dextran and sucrose resulted in the production of Au-MTX conjugates featuring excellent near-infrared (NIR) optical properties with a long-wavelength plasmon resonance near 630-760 nm. Moreover, in vitro bioassays showed that cancer cell viabilities upon incubation with free MTX, Au-MTX conjugates doped with glucose, dextran and sucrose for 48 h were 74.6%, 55.0%, 62.0%, and 63.1%, respectively. Glucose-doped Au-MTX conjugates exhibited a higher anticancer activity than those doped with dextran and sucrose, therefore potentially presenting a promising treatment platform for anticancer therapy. Based on the present study, this work may provide the first example of using biocompatible sugars as regulating agents to effectively guide the shape and assembly behavior of Au-MTX conjugates. Potentially, the synergistic strategy of drug molecules and sugar molecules may offer the possibility to create more gold-based nanocarriers with new shapes and beneficial features for advanced anticancer therapy.",29341908,2018,"Induction of Au-methotrexate conjugates by sugar molecules: production, assembly mechanism, and bioassay studies."
97,"Deferoxamine (DFO) to treat iron overload (IO) has been limited by toxicity issues and short circulation times and it would be desirable to prolong circulation to improve non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) chelation. In addition, DFO is currently unable to efficiently target the large pool of iron in the liver and spleen. Nanogel-Deferoxamine conjugates (NG-DFO) can prove useful as a model to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and biodistribution (BD) behavior of iron-chelating macromolecules and their overall effect on serum ferritin levels. NG-DFO reduced the cytotoxicity of DFO and significantly reduced cellular ferritin levels in IO macrophages in vitro. PK/BD studies in normal rats revealed that NG-DFO displayed prolonged circulation and preferential accumulation into the liver and spleen. IO mice treated with NG1-DFO presented significantly lower levels of serum ferritin compared to DFO. Total renal and fecal elimination data point to the need to balance prolonged circulation with controlled degradation to accelerate clearance of iron-chelating macromolecules.",29341909,2018,"Nanogel-DFO conjugates as a model to investigate pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and iron chelation in vivo."
98,"Early-life stress is a risk factor for comorbid anxiety and nicotine use. Because little is known about the factors underlying this comorbidity, we investigated the effects of adolescent stress on anxiety-like behavior and nicotine responses within individual animals. Adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic variable social stress (CVSS; repeated cycles of social isolation + social reorganization) or control conditions from postnatal days (PND) 25-59. Anxiety-like behavior and social avoidance were measured in the elevated plus-maze (PND 61-65) and social approach-avoidance test (Experiment 1: PND 140-144; Experiment 2: 95-97), respectively. Acute nicotine-induced locomotor, hypothermic, corticosterone responses, (Experiment 1: PND 56-59; Experiment 2: PND 65-70) and voluntary oral nicotine consumption (Experiment 1: PND 116-135; Experiment 2: 73-92) were also examined. Finally, we assessed prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAC) synaptic transmission (PND 64-80); brain regions that are implicated in anxiety and addiction. Mice exposed to adolescent CVSS displayed increased anxiety-like behavior relative to controls. Further, CVSS altered synaptic excitability in PFC and NAC neurons in a sex-specific manner. For males, CVSS decreased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in the PFC and NAC, respectively. In females, CVSS decreased the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the NAC. Adolescent CVSS did not affect social avoidance or nicotine responses and anxiety-like behavior was not reliably associated with nicotine responses within individual animals. Taken together, complex interactions between PFC and NAC function may contribute to adolescent stress-induced anxiety-like behavior without influencing nicotine responses.",29343455,2018,"Adolescent Social Stress Increases Anxiety-like Behavior and Alters Synaptic Transmission, Without Influencing Nicotine Responses, in a Sex-Dependent Manner."
99,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling in the hippocampus has been established to be important for mediating the effects of stress on learning and memory. Given our laboratory's recent characterization of a subset of hippocampal CRH neurons as a novel class of GABAergic interneurons, we hypothesized that these local GABAergic hippocampal CRH neurons may influence hippocampal function. Here we applied an array of molecular tools to selectively label and manipulate hippocampal CRH neurons in mice, in order to assess this interneuron population's impact on hippocampus-dependent behaviors and hippocampal network excitability. Genetically-targeted ablation of hippocampal CRH neurons in vivo impaired object recognition memory and substantially enhanced the severity of kainic acid-induced seizures. Conversely, selective activation of CRH neurons in vitro suppressed the excitability of the mossy fiber-CA3 pathway. Additional experiments are needed to reconcile the functions of GABA and CRH signaling of hippocampal CRH neurons on hippocampal function. However, our results indicate that this interneuron population plays an important role in maintaining adaptive network excitability, and provide a specific circuit-level mechanism for this role.",29346425,2018,Hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons support recognition memory and modulate hippocampal excitability.
100,"BACKGROUND
Prescription opioids have been linked to over half of the 28,000 opioid overdose deaths in 2014. High rates of prescription opioid non-medical use have continued despite nearly all states implementing large-scale prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), which points to the need to examine the impact of state PDMP's on curbing inappropriate opioid prescribing. In the short-term, PDMPs have been associated with short-term prescribing declines. Yet little is known about how such policies differentially impact patient subgroups or are interpreted by prescribing providers. Our objective was to compare volumes of prescribed opioids before and after Indiana implemented opioid prescribing emergency rules and stratify the changes in opioid prescribing by patient and provider subgroups.


METHODS
An interrupted time series analysis was conducted using data obtained from the Indiana PDMP. Prescription level data was merged with census data to characterize patient socioeconomic status. Analyses were stratified by patients' gender, age, opioid dosage, and payer. The primary outcome indicator was the total morphine equivalent dose (MED) of dispensed opioids per day in the state of Indiana. Also considered were number of unique patients, unique providers, and prescriptions; MED per transaction and per day; and number of days supplied.


RESULTS
After controlling for time trends, we found that total MED for opioids decreased after implementing the new emergency rules, differing by patient gender, age, and payer. The effect was larger for males than females and almost 10 times larger for 0-20 year olds as compared to the 60+ age range. Medicare and Medicaid patients experienced more decline in prescribing than patients with private insurance. Patients with prescriptions paid for by workers' comp experienced the most significant decline. The emergency rules were associated with decline in both the number of prescribers and the number of day supply.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the Indiana opioid prescribing emergency rules impacted statewide prescribing behavior across all individual patient and provider characteristics, the emergency rules' effect was not consistent across patient characteristics. Further studies are needed to assess how individual patient characteristics influence the interpretation and application of state policies on opioid prescribing.",29347984,2018,The effects of state rules on opioid prescribing in Indiana.
101,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-related disease, affecting a majority of elderly men worldwide. Medical management of BPH is an alternative to surgical treatment of this disease. Currently, α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) antagonists are among the first line drugs to treat BPH by reducing the tension of urinary track and thus the obstructive symptoms in voiding. In drug development, old male dogs with spontaneous BPH are considered the golden standard of the animal models. However, old dogs (>6 years) are expensive and not all old dogs develop BPH. So it is necessary to develop more accessible animal models for drug efficacy evaluation. Here we describe the development of testosterone-induced BPH models in both rats and young adult dogs and their applications in the in vivo evaluation of α1-AR antagonist. The BPH rats and dogs induced by chronic testosterone treatment have significantly increased micturition frequency and reduced mean voided volume, very similar to the clinical symptoms of BPH patients. Silodosin, an α1-AR antagonist, significantly reduces the urinary frequency and increases the voided volume in BPH model animals in a dose-dependent manner. The results demonstrate that testosterone-induced BPH rat and dog models might provide a more efficient way to evaluate micturition behavior in anti-BPH drug studies.",29351556,2018,Testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia rat and dog as facile models to assess drugs targeting lower urinary tract symptoms.
102,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
Compare nocturnal REM sleep without atonia (nRWA) and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) between pediatric patients with and without narcolepsy and determine if the nRWA index is a valid diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy.


METHODS
Retrospective cohort study of children ages 6 to 18 years who completed a nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Our study sample included 11 patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), 6 with narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), 12 with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), and 11 with subjective hypersomnia (sHS). We compared group nRWA indices (epochs of RWA/total stage R sleep epochs) from the nocturnal PSGs and analyzed nRWA index receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics for narcolepsy diagnosis.


RESULTS
The median nRWA index of patients with NT1 was 15 to 30 times higher compared to sHS and IH (Ps < .005) but similar to that of the NT2 group (P = .46). RBD was present in 25% of patients with narcolepsy (NT1 and NT2). In comparing those with and without narcolepsy, the nRWA index area under the curve was 0.87 (0.6), 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75 to 0.99, P < .001. The threshold of having ≥ 1% of stage R sleep epochs with nRWA yielded a sensitivity of 88.2%, 95% CI = 63.6-98.5 and specificity of 60.9%, 95% CI = 38.5 to 80.3 for diagnosis of narcolepsy. In contrast, a threshold of ≥ 8% yielded a specificity of 95.7%, 95% CI = 78.1 to 99.9 and sensitivity of 52.9%, 95% CI = 27.8 to 77.


CONCLUSIONS
The nRWA index is a very good diagnostic biomarker of pediatric narcolepsy. Depending on the clinical cutoffs utilized, this biomarker can identify more children/adolescents with narcolepsy using just the PSG or reduce false-positive diagnostic results.",29351827,2018,Nocturnal REM Sleep Without Atonia Is a Diagnostic Biomarker of Pediatric Narcolepsy.
103,"Empowering consumers to be active decision-makers in their own care is a core tenet of personalized, or precision medicine. Nonetheless, there is a dearth of research on intervention preferences in families seeking interventions for a child with behavior problems. Specifically, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether providing parents with choice of intervention improves child/youth outcomes (i.e., reduces externalizing problems). In this study, 129 families presenting to community mental health clinics for child conduct problems were enrolled in a doubly randomized preference study and initially randomized to choice or no-choice conditions. Families assigned to the choice condition were offered their choice of intervention from among three different formats of the Parent Management Training-Oregon Model/PMTO (group, individual clinic, home based) and services-as-usual (child-focused therapy). Those assigned to the no-choice condition were again randomized, to one of the four intervention conditions. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed partial support for the effect of parental choice on child intervention outcomes. Assignment to the choice condition predicted teacher-reported improved child hyperactivity/inattention outcomes at 6 months post-treatment completion. No main effect of choice on parent reported child outcomes was found. Moderation analyses indicated that among parents who selected PMTO, teacher report of hyperactivity/inattention was significantly improved compared with parents selecting SAU, and compared with those assigned to PMTO within the no-choice condition. Contrary to hypotheses, teacher report of hyperactivity/inattention was also significantly improved for families assigned to SAU within the no-choice condition, indicating that within the no-choice condition, SAU outperformed the parenting interventions. Implications for prevention research are discussed.",29352401,2018,Does Giving Parents Their Choice of Interventions for Child Behavior Problems Improve Child Outcomes?
104,"OBJECTIVE
Acrolein, a highly reactive unsaturated aldehyde, is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and oxidative damage induced by acrolein is hypothesized to involve in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Calorie restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention that has consistently been verified to retard aging by ameliorating oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CR on acrolein-induced neurotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.


METHODS
A total of 45 weaned and specific-pathogen-free SD rats (male, weighing 180-220 g) were gavage-fed with acrolein (2.5 mg/kg/day) and fed ab libitum of 10 g/day or 7 g/day (representing 30% CR regimen), or gavage-fed with same volume of tap water and fed al libitum as vehicle control for 12 weeks. After behavioral test conducted by Morris Water Maze, SD rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were prepared for histochemical evaluation and Western blotting to detect alterations in oxidative stress, BDNF/TrkB pathway and key enzymes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism.


RESULTS
Treatment with 30% CR in SD rats significantly attenuated acrolein-induced cognitive impairment. Oxidative damage including deletion of glutathione and superoxide dismutase and sharp rise in malondialdehyde were notably improved by 30% CR. Further study suggested that 30% CR showed protective effects against acrolein by modulating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways. Moreover, 30% CR restored acrolein-induced changes of APP, β-secretase, α-secretase and receptor for advanced glycation end products.

In the past decade, Aeromonas hydrophila has become increasingly important because of its emergence as a food-borne zoonotic pathogen that is resistant to different treatment regimes. Being an aquatic bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila is frequently subjected to several stressful environmental conditions, including changes in temperature, acidic pH and starvation that challenge its survival. To cope with these stressful conditions, like every cell, A. hydrophila possesses stress response mechanisms, such as alternative sigma factors, two-component systems, heat shock proteins, cold shock proteins, and acid tolerance response systems that eventually lead the fittest to survive. Moreover, the establishment of genetic variations among the strains related to environmental stress is also of great concern. This review presents the understandings based on inter-strain variations and stress response behavior of A. hydrophila that are important to control the increasing outbreaks of this bacterium in both human populations and aquaculture.",29355702,2018,The fight for invincibility: Environmental stress response mechanisms and Aeromonas hydrophila.
106,"To better understand the impact of aging, along with other demographic and brain health variables, on the neural networks that support different aspects of cognitive performance, we applied a brute-force search technique based on Principal Components Analysis to derive 4 corresponding spatial covariance patterns (termed Reference Ability Neural Networks -RANNs) from a large sample of participants across the age range. 255 clinically healthy, community-dwelling adults, aged 20-77, underwent fMRI while performing 12 tasks, 3 tasks for each of the following cognitive reference abilities: Episodic Memory, Reasoning, Perceptual Speed, and Vocabulary. The derived RANNs (1) showed selective activation to their specific cognitive domain and (2) correlated with behavioral performance. Quasi out-of-sample replication with Monte-Carlo 5-fold cross validation was built into our approach, and all patterns indicated their corresponding reference ability and predicted performance in held-out data to a degree significantly greater than chance level. RANN-pattern expression for Episodic Memory, Reasoning and Vocabulary were associated selectively with age, while the pattern for Perceptual Speed showed no such age-related influences. For each participant we also looked at residual activity unaccounted for by the RANN-pattern derived for the cognitive reference ability. Higher residual activity was associated with poorer brain-structural health and older age, but -apart from Vocabulary-not with cognitive performance, indicating that older participants with worse brain-structural health might recruit alternative neural resources to maintain performance levels.",29355766,2018,Reference ability neural networks and behavioral performance across the adult life span.
107,"Ras proteins are oncoproteins which play a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. All Ras proteins' signaling strongly depends on their correct localization in the cell membrane. Over 30% of cancers are driven by mutant Ras proteins, and KRas4B is the Ras isoform most frequently mutated. C6-ceramide has been shown to inhibit the growth activity of KRas4B mutated cells. However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition remains elusive. Here, we established a heterogeneous model biomembrane containing C6-ceramide. C6-ceramide incorporation does not disrupt the lipid membrane. Addition of KRas4B leads to drastic changes in the lateral membrane organization of the membrane, however. In contrast to the partitioning behavior in other membranes, KRas4B forms small, monodisperse nanoclusters dispersed in a fluid-like environment, in all likelihood induced by some kind of lipid sorting mechanism. Fluorescence cross-correlation data indicate no direct interaction between C6-ceramide and KRas4B, suggesting that KRas4B essentially recruits other lipids. A FRET-based binding assay reveals that the stability of KRas4B proteins inserted into the membrane containing C6-ceramide is reduced. Based on the combined results obtained, we postulate a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of KRas4B mutated cells' activity through C6-ceramide.",29357287,2018,Interaction of KRas4B protein with C6-ceramide containing lipid model membranes.
108,"Wolfram syndrome (WS), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene (WFS1), is characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, bilateral optic atrophy, and a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein, and mutations in this gene lead to pancreatic β-cell death induced by high levels of ER stress. However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration caused by WFS1 deficiency remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of WFS1 in the maintenance of neuronal integrity in vivo by knocking down the expression of wfs1, the Drosophila homolog of WFS1, in the central nervous system. Neuronal knockdown of wfs1 caused age-dependent behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration in the fly brain. Knockdown of wfs1 in neurons and glial cells resulted in premature death and significantly exacerbated behavioral deficits in flies, suggesting that wfs1 has important functions in both cell types. Although wfs1 knockdown alone did not promote ER stress, it increased the susceptibility to oxidative stress-, excitotoxicity- or tauopathy-induced behavioral deficits, and neurodegeneration. The glutamate release inhibitor riluzole significantly suppressed premature death phenotypes induced by neuronal and glial knockdown of wfs1. This study highlights the protective role of wfs1 against age-associated neurodegeneration and furthers our understanding of potential disease-modifying factors that determine susceptibility and resilience to age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",29357349,2018,"Knockdown of wfs1, a fly homolog of Wolfram syndrome 1, in the nervous system increases susceptibility to age- and stress-induced neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in Drosophila."
109,"Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.",29357357,2018,What drives the perceptual change resulting from speech motor adaptation?

110,"Speaking more than one language is associated with neurocognitive benefits in seniors (Alladi et al. 2013). Few studies however have tested this hypothesis directly by comparing bilingual seniors who vary in chronological age. We report a Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) study showing cumulative effects of age on grey matter volume (GMV) in brain structures that are involved in cognitive control in bilingual seniors and found no differences in RT or accuracy between bilingual and monolingual seniors on a behavioral test of cognitive control called the Attentional Network Task (ANT), and no differences in GMV for selected ROIs between groups. However, chronological age predicted the size of interference and conflict effects for monolingual speakers only. We also observed a more widespread pattern of bilateral aging-effcts in brain regions that are classically associated with aging in monolingual speakers compared to bilingual speakers. Notably, GMV in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the level of daily exposure to a second language (L2) independently predict performance on the ANT in bilingual speakers. We conclude that regular (daily) bilingual experience mitigates the typical effects of aging on cognitive control at the behavioral and the neural level.",29360516,2018,Bilingualism and healthy aging: Aging effects and neural maintenance.
111,"This study used mice to evaluate whether coupling expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) creates central interactions that blunt endocrine and behavioral responses to psychogenic stress. Central administration of diminazene aceturate, an ACE2 activator, had no effect on restraint-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; however, mice that ubiquitously overexpress ACE2 had reduced plasma corticosterone (CORT) and pituitary expression of POMC mRNA. The Cre-LoxP system was used to restrict ACE2 overexpression to CRH synthesizing cells and probe whether HPA axis suppression was the result of central ACE2 and CRH interactions. Within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), mice with ACE2 overexpression directed to CRH had a ≈2.5 fold increase in ACE2 mRNA, which co-localized with CRH mRNA. Relative to controls, mice overexpressing ACE2 in CRH cells had a decreased CORT response to restraint as well as decreased CRH mRNA in the PVN and CEA and POMC mRNA in the pituitary. Administration of ACTH similarly increased plasma CORT, indicating that the blunted HPA axis activation that accompanies ACE2 overexpression in CRH cells is centrally mediated. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed to determine whether the decreased HPA axis activation was predictive of anxiolysis. Mice with ACE2 overexpression directed to CRH cells displayed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and open field when compared to that of controls. Collectively, these results suggest that exogenous ACE2 suppresses CRH synthesis, which alters the central processing of psychogenic stress, thereby blunting HPA axis activation and attenuating anxiety-like behavior.",29360543,2018,Coupling corticotropin-releasing-hormone and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 dampens stress responsiveness in male mice.
112,"BACKGROUND
Several frameworks now exist to guide intervention development but there remains only limited evidence of their application to health interventions based around use of mobile phones or devices, particularly in a low-resource setting. We aimed to describe our experience of using the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework on complex interventions to develop and evaluate an adherence support intervention for high blood pressure delivered by SMS text message. We further aimed to describe the developed intervention in line with reporting guidelines for a structured and systematic description.


METHODS
We used a non-sequential and flexible approach guided by the 2008 MRC Framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions.


RESULTS
We reviewed published literature and established a multi-disciplinary expert group to guide the development process. We selected health psychology theory and behaviour change techniques that have been shown to be important in adherence and persistence with chronic medications. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with various stakeholders identified ways in which treatment adherence could be supported and also identified key features of well-regarded messages: polite tone, credible information, contextualised, and endorsed by identifiable member of primary care facility staff. Direct and indirect user testing enabled us to refine the intervention including refining use of language and testing of interactive components.


CONCLUSIONS
Our experience shows that using a formal intervention development process is feasible in a low-resource multi-lingual setting. The process enabled us to pre-test assumptions about the intervention and the evaluation process, allowing the improvement of both. Describing how a multi-component intervention was developed including standardised descriptions of content aimed to support behaviour change will enable comparison with other similar interventions and support development of new interventions. Even in low-resource settings, funders and policy-makers should provide researchers with time and resources for intervention development work and encourage evaluation of the entire design and testing process.

113,"BACKGROUND
Direct-to-consumer (DTC) promotion of prescription drugs can affect consumer behaviors and health outcomes, and Internet drug promotion is growing rapidly. Branded drug websites often capitalize on the multimedia capabilities of the Internet by using videos to emphasize drug benefits and characteristics. However, it is unknown how such videos affect consumer processing of drug information.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to examine how videos on prescription drug websites, and the inclusion of risk information in those videos, influence consumer knowledge and perceptions.


METHODS
We conducted an experimental study in which online panel participants with acid reflux (n=1070) or high blood pressure (n=1055) were randomly assigned to view 1 of the 10 fictitious prescription drug websites and complete a short questionnaire. On each website, we manipulated the type of video (patient testimonial, mechanism of action animation, or none) and whether the video mentioned drug risks.


RESULTS
Participants who viewed any video were less likely to recognize drug risks presented only in the website text (P≤.01). Including risk information in videos increased participants' recognition of the risks presented in the videos (P≤.01). However, in some cases, including risk information in videos decreased participants' recognition of the risks not presented in the videos (ie, risks presented in text only; P≤.04). Participants who viewed a video without drug risk information thought that the website placed more emphasis on benefits, compared with participants who viewed the video with drug risk information (P≤.01). Compared with participants who viewed a video without drug risk information, participants who viewed a video with drug risk information thought that the drug was less effective in the high blood pressure sample (P=.03) and thought that risks were more serious in the acid reflux sample (P=.01). There were no significant differences between risk and nonrisk video conditions on other perception measures (P>.05). In addition, we noted a few differences among the types of videos.

Paper questionnaires have traditionally been the first choice for data collection in research. However, declining response rates over the past decade have increased the risk of selection bias in cross-sectional studies. The growing use of the Internet offers new ways of collecting data, but trials using Web-based questionnaires have so far seen mixed results. A secure, online digital mailbox (e-Boks) linked to a civil registration number became mandatory for all Danish citizens in 2014 (exemption granted only in extraordinary cases). Approximately 89% of the Danish population have a digital mailbox, which is used for correspondence with public authorities.

We designed a cross-sectional comparative study. An invitation to participate in a survey on help-seeking behavior in out-of-hours care was sent to two groups of randomly selected citizens from age groups 30-39 and 50-59 years and parents to those aged 0-4 years using either traditional surface mail (paper group) or digital mail sent to a secure online mailbox (digital group). Costs per respondent were measured by adding up all costs for handling, dispatch, printing, and work salary and then dividing the total figure by the number of respondents. Data completeness was assessed by comparing the number of missing values between the two methods. Socioeconomic variables (age, gender, family income, education duration, immigrant status, and job status) were compared both between respondents and nonrespondents and within these groups to evaluate the degree of selection bias.


RESULTS
A total 3600 citizens were invited in each group; 1303 (36.29%) responded to the digital invitation and 1653 (45.99%) to the paper invitation (difference 9.66%, 95% CI 7.40-11.92). The costs were €1.51 per respondent for the digital group and €15.67 for paper group respondents. Paper questionnaires generally had more missing values; this was significant in five of 17 variables (P<.05). Substantial differences were found in the socioeconomic variables between respondents and nonrespondents, whereas only minor differences were seen within the groups of respondents and nonrespondents.


CONCLUSIONS
Although we found lower response rates for Web-based invitations, this solution was more cost-effective (by a factor of 10) and had slightly lower numbers of missing values than questionnaires sent with paper invitations. Analyses of socioeconomic variables showed almost no difference between nonrespondents in both groups, which could imply that the lower response rate in the digital group does not necessarily increase the level of selection bias. Invitations to questionnaire studies via digital mail may be an excellent option for collecting research data in the future. This study may serve as the foundational pillar of digital data collection in health care research in Scandinavia and other countries considering implementing similar systems.",29362206,2018,"Paper- or Web-Based Questionnaire Invitations as a Method for Data Collection: Cross-Sectional Comparative Study of Differences in Response Rate, Completeness of Data, and Financial Cost."
115,"Lane-changing (LC) behavior is investigated on Chinese freeways, where the driving circumstances are relatively aggressive. Three data sets were collected from urban expressways and an intercity highway in the form of traffic videos. Different aspects of LC behaviors are analyzed, i.e., the LC rate, motivation, target lane choice and impact on traffic. The results suggest that LC is a transient behavior that randomly occurs with high frequency, which is the main feature of aggressive driving. Several LC patterns and the combination effect of ramps, fast lanes and various vehicle types are presented. The influence of LC on local traffic endures for approximately 15 to 30 s, which rapidly increases and slowly declines. LC behavior will increase the risk of high-speed car-following. All results are obtained from the empirical data; they will be useful for traffic management and traffic modeling.",29364936,2018,Empirical study of lane-changing behavior on three Chinese freeways.
116,"Cardiolipin in eukaryotes is found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts with membrane proteins and, although not essential, is necessary for the optimal activity of a number of proteins. One of them is the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, which imports ADP into the mitochondrion and exports ATP. In the crystal structures, cardiolipin is bound to three equivalent sites of the ADP/ATP carrier, but its role is unresolved. Conservation of residues at these cardiolipin binding sites across other members of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily indicates cardiolipin binding is likely to be important for the function of all mitochondrial carriers. Multiscale simulations were performed in a cardiolipin-containing membrane to investigate the dynamics of cardiolipin around the yeast and bovine ADP/ATP carriers in a lipid bilayer and the properties of the cardiolipin-binding sites. In coarse-grain simulations, cardiolipin molecules bound to the carriers for longer periods of time than phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids-with timescales in the tens of microseconds. Three long-lived cardiolipin binding sites overlapped with those in the crystal structures of the carriers. Other shorter-lived cardiolipin interaction sites were identified in both membrane leaflets. However, the timescales of the interactions were of the same order as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting that these sites are not specific for cardiolipin binding. The calculation of lipid binding times and the overlap of the cardiolipin binding sites between the structures and simulations demonstrate the potential of multiscale simulations to investigate the dynamics and behavior of lipids interacting with membrane proteins.",29366674,2018,Cardiolipin dynamics and binding to conserved residues in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.
117,"Human behavior and cognition result from a complex pattern of interactions between brain regions. The flexible reconfiguration of these patterns enables behavioral adaptation, such as the acquisition of a new motor skill. Yet, the degree to which these reconfigurations depend on the brain's baseline sensorimotor integration is far from understood. Here, we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in sensorimotor networks at baseline were predictive of individual differences in future learning. We analyzed functional MRI data from 19 participants prior to six weeks of training on a new motor skill. We found that visual-motor connectivity was inversely related to learning rate: sensorimotor autonomy at baseline corresponded to faster learning in the future. Using three additional scans, we found that visual-motor connectivity at baseline is a relatively stable individual trait. These results suggest that individual differences in motor skill learning can be predicted from sensorimotor autonomy at baseline prior to task execution.",29366697,2018,Predicting future learning from baseline network architecture.
118,"BACKGROUND
The cognitive-behavioral model of problematic Internet use (PIU) proposes that psychological well-being is associated with specific thoughts and behaviors on the Internet. Hence, there is growing concern that PIU is associated with psychological impairments.


OBJECTIVE
Given the proposal of gender schema theory and social role theory, men and women are predisposed to experience social anxiety and engage in Internet use differently. Thus, an investigation of gender differences in these areas is warranted. According to the cognitive-behavioral model of PIU, social anxiety is associated with specific cognitions and behaviors on the Internet. Thus, an investigation of the association between social anxiety and PIU is essential. In addition, research that takes into account the multidimensional nature of social anxiety and PIU is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore multivariate gender differences in and the relationships between social anxiety and PIU.


METHODS
Participants included 505 college students, of whom 241 (47.7%) were women and 264 (52.3%) were men. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 22 years, with a mean age of 20.34 (SD=1.16). The Social Anxiety Scale and Problematic Internet Use Scale were used in data collection. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and canonical correlation analysis were used.


RESULTS
Mean differences between men and women were not statistically significant in social anxiety (λ=.02, F3,501=2.47, P=.06). In all three PIU dimensions, men scored higher than women, and MANOVA shows that multivariate difference was statistically significant (λ=.94, F3,501=10.69, P<.001). Of the canonical correlation functions computed for men, only the first was significant (Rc=.43, λ=.78, χ29=64.7, P<.001) and accounted for 19% of the overlapping variance. Similarly, only the first canonical function was significant for women (Rc=.36, λ=.87, χ29=33.9, P<.001), which accounted for 13% of the overlapping variance.


CONCLUSIONS
On the basis of the findings, we conclude that enhanced educational opportunities for women and their increasing role in the society have led women to become more active and thus closed the gap in social anxiety levels between men and women. We found that men showed more difficulties than women in terms of running away from personal problems (ie, social benefit), used the Internet more excessively, and experienced more interpersonal problems with significant others due to Internet use. We conclude that men are under a greater risk of social impairments due to PIU. Our overall conclusion is that there is a substantial amount of association between social anxiety and PIU and the association is stronger for men than it is for women. We advise that future research continue to investigate PIU and social anxiety as multidimensional constructs.",29367182,2018,Gender Differences in and the Relationships Between Social Anxiety and Problematic Internet Use: Canonical Analysis.
119,"The current study investigated behavioral and neuroimaging evidence for orthographic influences on auditory word identification. To assess such influences, the proportion of similar sounding words (i.e. phonological neighbors) that were also spelled similarly (i.e., orthographic neighbors) was computed for each auditorily presented word as the Orthographic-to-Phonological Overlap Ratio (OPOR). Speech intelligibility was manipulated by presenting monosyllabic words in multi-talker babble at two signal-to-noise ratios: + 3 and + 10 dB SNR. Identification rates were lower for high overlap words in the challenging + 3 dB SNR condition. In addition, BOLD contrast increased with OPOR at the more difficult SNR, and decreased with OPOR under more favorable SNR conditions. Both voxel-based and region of interest analyses demonstrated robust effects of OPOR in several cingulo-opercular regions. However, contrary to prior theoretical accounts, no task-related activity was observed in posterior regions associated with phonological or orthographic processing. We suggest that, when processing is difficult, orthographic-to-phonological feature overlap increases the availability of competing responses, which then requires additional support from domain general performance systems in order to produce a single response.",29371094,2018,Orthographic influence on spoken word identification: Behavioral and fMRI evidence.
120,"Typically developing infants rapidly acquire a sophisticated array of social skills within the first year of life. These social skills are largely learned within the context of day-to-day interactions with caregivers. While social neuroscience has made great gains in our knowledge of the underlying neural circuitry of social cognition and behavior, much of this work has focused on experiments that sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising methodology for measuring brain activity in the context of naturalistic social interactions. Here, we review what we have learned from fNIRS studies that have used traditional experimental stimuli to study social development during infancy. We then discuss recent infant fNIRS studies that have utilized more naturalistic social stimuli, followed by a discussion of applications of this methodology to the study of atypical social development, with a focus on infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder. We end with recommendations for applying fNIRS to studies of typically developing and at-risk infants in naturalistic social situations.",29371139,2018,The infant brain in the social world: Moving toward interactive social neuroscience with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
121,"In this study, we reported a redox-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on heparosan and deoxycholic acid conjugates (HSDs) for effective treatment of laryngopharyngeal carcinoma. The amphiphilic HSDs can self-assemble into stable nanoscale micelles in aqueous medium with favorable drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). The HSD micelles can exhibit glutathione (GSH)-triggered drug release behavior and reach a nearly 100% release rate in a high GSH level (10 mM) environment. Moreover, FaDu cancer cells can internalize HSD micelles by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is energy dependent, fast, and effective. The DOX@HSD induced inhibition of FaDu cancer cells can achieve a minimum of 10-fold selectivity relative to that of COS-7 normal cells. Overall, the redox-responsive DDSs show good biocompatibility and are promising in the clinical treatment of laryngopharyngeal carcinoma.",29371149,2018,Redox-responsive micelles for triggered drug delivery and effective laryngopharyngeal cancer therapy.
122,"Measuring temporal discounting through the use of intertemporal choice tasks is now the gold standard method for quantifying human choice impulsivity (impatience) in neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, public health and computational psychiatry. A recent area of growing interest is individual differences in discounting levels, as these may predispose to (or protect from) mental health disorders, addictive behaviors, and other diseases. At the same time, more and more studies have been dedicated to the quantification of individual attitudes towards risk, which have been measured in many clinical and non-clinical populations using closely related techniques. Economists have pointed to interactions between measurements of time preferences and risk preferences that may distort estimations of the discount rate. However, although becoming standard practice in economics, discount rates and risk preferences are rarely measured simultaneously in the same subjects in other fields, and the magnitude of the imposed distortion is unknown in the assessment of individual differences. Here, we show that standard models of temporal discounting -such as a hyperbolic discounting model widely present in the literature which fails to account for risk attitudes in the estimation of discount rates- result in a large and systematic pattern of bias in estimated discounting parameters. This can lead to the spurious attribution of differences in impulsivity between individuals when in fact differences in risk attitudes account for observed behavioral differences. We advance a model which, when applied to standard choice tasks typically used in psychology and neuroscience, provides both a better fit to the data and successfully de-correlates risk and impulsivity parameters. This results in measures that are more accurate and thus of greater utility to the many fields interested in individual differences in impulsivity.",29373590,2018,Risk preferences impose a hidden distortion on measures of choice impulsivity.
123,"Smokers who inaccurately believe that FDA evaluates cigarettes for safety hold lower harm perceptions of cigarettes compared to those who do not hold this belief. However, not much is known about associations between beliefs about FDA tobacco regulatory authority and comparative harm perceptions of tobacco products. Data were analyzed from the Health Information National Trends Survey, HINTS-FDA 2015 (N = 3738), which is a cross-sectional, probability-based, nationally representative survey of U.S. non-institutionalized civilian adults aged 18 years or older. Weighted multinomial and logistic regression analyses regressed comparative harm perceptions on sociodemographic factors, beliefs about FDA regulatory authority, perceptions of FDA credibility, and beliefs about modifiability of cancer risk (behavioral cancer causal beliefs and cancer fatalism). Findings indicate that, compared to non-users, current tobacco users are more likely to report believing that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes, to report believing that some cigarette types may be less harmful than others, and to report believing that tobacco products are safer now than they were five years ago. Awareness of FDA regulatory authority was associated with reporting the belief that tobacco products are safer now than five years ago, that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes, and that some cigarette types are less harmful than other cigarette types. Believing behavior as a cause of cancer and endorsing cancer fatalism were associated with uncertainty of comparative harm perceptions. Communication efforts can help target inaccurate beliefs by raising awareness about regulation of tobacco products as well as the risks of tobacco products.",29373819,2018,"Beliefs about FDA tobacco regulation, modifiability of cancer risk, and tobacco product comparative harm perceptions: Findings from the HINTS-FDA 2015."
124,"BACKGROUND
Chronic conditions in the United States are among the most costly and preventable of all health problems. Research suggests health coaching is an effective strategy for reducing health risks including decreases in weight, blood pressure, lipids, and blood glucose. Much less is known about how and when coaching works.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to conduct an analysis of intrapersonal variations in participants' progression in health coaching, examining gender and age-related differences.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of 35,333 health coaching participants between 2012 and 2016. Differences in number of goals and activities set and completed, and number of interactions were assessed using negative binomial models. Differences in goal type were assessed using logistic regression for gender and using the Welch test for age to account for unequal variances.


RESULTS
Participants choosing online coaching were more likely to be younger and female (P<.001). Gender and age differences were found for the types of goals set by participants. Regarding program activity, women set and completed 12% more action steps than men (P<.001), averaging 21% more interactions than men (P<.001); no gender differences were found in number of goals completed (P=.12), although the percentage of males and females completing goals was significantly different at 60 and 120 days postenrollment (P<.001). Results indicated significant age-related differences in all aspects of program activity: number of interactions, goals set and completed, action steps set and completed (all P values <.01), as well as significant differences in percentage of individuals completing initial goals within 30 days, with older individuals completing more than younger individuals did (all P values <.001).


CONCLUSIONS
This study found significant intrapersonal variation in how people participate in and progress through a coaching program. Age-related variations were found in all aspects of coaching activity, from modality preference and initial choice of goal type (eg, weight management, tobacco cessation) to goal completion, whereas gender-related differences were demonstrated for all program activities except number of goals set and completed. These findings indicate that to maximize behavior change, coaches need to personalize the coaching experience to the individual.",29374005,2018,Intrapersonal Variation in Goal Setting and Achievement in Health Coaching: Cross-Sectional Retrospective Analysis.
125,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by severe motor deficits and reduced striatal dopamine levels. PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive flexibility impairments, e.g., probabilistic reversal learning deficits that limit daily living. However, less is known about how decreased striatal dopamine signaling affects cognitive flexibility. Past studies indicate that the rat dorsomedial striatum is a striatal subregion that supports cognitive flexibility. Because PD patients exhibit probabilistic reversal learning deficits, the present experiment investigated whether the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injected into the dorsomedial striatum of male Long-Evans rats affects the acquisition and/or reversal learning of a spatial discrimination using a probabilistic learning procedure (80/20). Behavioral testing was conducted in a cross maze that occurred across two consecutive days. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions were not impaired on acquisition, but were impaired in reversal learning compared to that of sham controls. In reversal learning, dorsomedial striatal dopamine depletion led to initial perseveration of the previously correct choice pattern, as well as an impairment in maintaining the new choice pattern after initially selected (regressive errors). A 6-OHDA lesion in the dorsomedial striatum also significantly increased 'lose-shift' probabilities in reversal learning suggesting that reduced dopamine signaling in this striatal area increased sensitivity to negative feedback ultimately impairing the maintenance of a new response pattern. Overall, the findings suggest that dopamine reduction in this striatal subregion can serve as a useful model to test novel treatments for ameliorating cognitive flexibility deficits in PD.",29374536,2018,Cognitive Flexibility Deficits Following 6-OHDA Lesions of the Rat Dorsomedial Striatum.
126,"Among insects, Hymenoptera present a striking olfactory system with a clear neural dichotomy from the periphery to higher order centers, based on two main tracts of second-order (projection) neurons: the medial and lateral antennal lobe tracts (m-ALT and l-ALT). Despite substantial work on this dual pathway, its exact function is yet unclear. Here, we ask how attributes of odor quality and odor quantity are represented in the projection neurons (PNs) of the two pathways. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we compared the responses of m-ALT and l-ALT PNs of the honey bee Apis mellifera to a panel of 16 aliphatic odorants, and to three chosen odorants at eight concentrations. The results show that each pathway conveys differential information about odorants' chemical features or concentration to higher order centers. While the l-ALT primarily conveys information about odorants' chain length, the m-ALT informs about odorants' functional group. Furthermore, each tract can only predict chemical distances or bees' behavioral responses for odorants that differ according to its main feature, chain length or functional group. Generally l-ALT neurons displayed more graded dose-response relationships than m-ALT neurons, with a correspondingly smoother progression of inter-odor distances with increasing concentration. Comparison of these results with previous data recorded at AL input reveals differential processing by local networks within the two pathways. These results support the existence of parallel processing of odorant features in the insect brain.",29374539,2018,Differential Processing by Two Olfactory Subsystems in the Honeybee Brain.

Four onion polysaccharides (ACLPs) solutions resulted into significant differences on their rheological properties.

The apparent viscosity of ACLPs solutions decreased with the acidic pH (4.0) or alkaline pH (10.0) which was further declined at higher temperature (90 °C). After the addition of various salts, ACLPs had apparent differences on apparent viscosity. The G' (storage modulus) and G″ (loss modulus) of ACLP solutions were increased with increasing oscillation frequency. Moreover, the crossover value of oscillation frequency gradually decreased with increasing concentration of ACLPs. Our results exhibited that among the ACLPs, CHSS can be used as supplements in the food industry as thickening agent, gelling agent and stabilizer.",29374565,2018,Effects of extraction methods on the rheological properties of polysaccharides from onion (Allium cepa L.).
128,"Efficient neural processing depends on regulating responses through suppression and facilitation of neural activity. Utilizing a well-known visual motion paradigm that evokes behavioral suppression and facilitation, and combining five different methodologies (behavioral psychophysics, computational modeling, functional MRI, pharmacology, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), we provide evidence that challenges commonly held assumptions about the neural processes underlying suppression and facilitation. We show that: (1) both suppression and facilitation can emerge from a single, computational principle - divisive normalization; there is no need to invoke separate neural mechanisms, (2) neural suppression and facilitation in the motion-selective area MT mirror perception, but strong suppression also occurs in earlier visual areas, and (3) suppression is not primarily driven by GABA-mediated inhibition. Thus, while commonly used spatial suppression paradigms may provide insight into neural response magnitudes in visual areas, they should not be used to infer neural inhibition.",29376822,2018,Suppression and facilitation of human neural responses.
129,"Synesthesia is associated with additional perceptual experiences, which are automatically and consistently triggered by specific inducing stimuli. Synesthesia is also accompanied by more general sensory and cortical changes, including enhanced modality-specific cortical excitability. Extensive cognitive training has been shown to generate synesthesia-like phenomenology but whether these experiences are accompanied by neurophysiological changes characteristic of synesthesia remains unknown. Addressing this question provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the neural basis of perceptual plasticity relevant to conscious experiences. Here we investigate whether extensive training of letter-color associations leads not only to synesthetic experiences, but also to changes in cortical excitability. We confirm that overtraining synesthetic associations results in synesthetic phenomenology. Stroop tasks further reveal synesthesia-like performance following training. Electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation show, respectively, enhanced visual evoked potentials (in response to untrained patterns) and lower phosphene thresholds, demonstrating specific cortical changes. An active (using letter-symbol training) and a passive control confirmed these results were due to letter-color training and not simply to repeated testing. Summarizing, we demonstrate specific cortical changes, following training-induced acquisition of synesthetic phenomenology that are characteristic of genuine synesthesia.

130,"Affective states, such as anticipatory anxiety, critically influence speech communication behavior in adults who stutter. However, there is currently little evidence regarding the involvement of the limbic system in speech disfluency during interpersonal communication. We designed this neuroimaging study and experimental procedure to sample neural activity during interpersonal communication between human participants, and to investigate the relationship between the amygdala activity and speech disfluency. Participants were required to engage in live communication with a stranger of the opposite sex in the MRI scanner environment. In the gaze condition, the stranger gazed at the participant without speaking, while in the live conversation condition, the stranger asked questions that the participant was required to answer. The stranger continued to gaze silently at the participant while the participant answered. Adults who stutter reported significantly higher discomfort than fluent controls during the experiment. Activity in the right amygdala, a key anatomical region in the limbic system involved in emotion, was significantly correlated with stuttering occurrences in adults who stutter. Right amygdala activity from pooled data of all participants also showed a significant correlation with discomfort level during the experiment. Activity in the prefrontal cortex, which forms emotion regulation neural circuitry with the amygdala, was decreased in adults who stutter than in fluent controls. This is the first study to demonstrate that amygdala activity during interpersonal communication is involved in disfluent speech in adults who stutter.",29378280,2018,Speech Disfluency-dependent Amygdala Activity in Adults Who Stutter: Neuroimaging of Interpersonal Communication in MRI Scanner Environment.
131,"OBJECTIVE
Adult picky eating (PE) has received increased attention in the eating behavior literature due to its important association with adult avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). The current study tested a model of potential risk factors of adult PE behavior, including perceived early parental feeding practices. An exploratory model was also utilized to understand associations with different aspects of adult PE behaviors.


METHODS
A sample of 1339 US adults recruited through Amazon's MTurk completed an online survey that included the recently developed Adult Picky Eating Questionnaire (APEQ), retrospective reports of parental feeding practices, and other measures of eating behavior and demographic variables. A structural equation modeling procedure tested a series of regression models that included BMI and disordered eating behaviors as covariates.


RESULTS
SEM modeling indicated that retrospective reports of greater parental pressure to eat, higher disgust sensitivity, lower PE age of onset, and experiencing an aversive food event were associated with general adult PE behavior. Results also indicated parental encouragement of healthy eating may be a protective factor, and that men endorsed higher levels of adult PE. Exploratory analyses indicated that cross-sectional predictors and covariates were differentially related to specific aspects of PE as measured by the APEQ subscales.

To address this question, we measured human brain activity before and after fear acquisition under conditions of 24 h sleep deprivation versus normal sleep using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Additionally, we explored whether the fear acquisition-induced change of brain activity during the fear memory consolidation window can be predicted by subjective fear ratings and autonomic fear response, assessed by skin conductance responses (SCR) during acquisition. Behaviorally, the SD group demonstrated increased subjective and autonomic fear responses compared to controls at the stage of fear acquisition. During the stage of fear consolidation, the SD group displayed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity and concomitantly increased amygdala activity. Moreover, in the SD group fear acquisition-induced brain activity changes in amygdala were positively correlated with both, subjective and autonomic fear indices during acquisition, whereas in controls changes vmPFC activity were positively correlated with fear indices during acquisition. Together, the present findings suggested that SD may weaken the top-down ability of the vmPFC to regulate amygdala activity during fear memory consolidation.

133,"BACKGROUND
Increased availability of maternal health services alone does not lead to better outcomes for maternal health.The services need to be utilized first.One way to increase service utilization is to plan responsive health care services by taking into account the community's views or expressed needs. Burundi has a high maternal mortality ratio, and despite improvements in health infrastructure, skilled staff and the abolition of user fees for pregnant women,utilization of maternal health services remains low. Possible reasons for this include a lack of responsive healthcare services. An exploratory study was conducted in 2013 in two provinces of Burundi (Makamba and Kayanza), with the aim to collect the experiences of women and men with the maternal health services,their views regarding those services, channels used to express these experiences, and the providers' reaction.


METHODS
Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from men and women and key informants, including community health workers, health committee members, health providers, local authorities, religious leaders and managers of non-governmental organizations. Data analysis was facilitated by MAXQDA 11 software.


RESULTS
Negative experiences with maternal health services were reported and included poor staff behavior towards women and a lack of medicine. Health committees and suggestion boxes were introduced by the government to channel the community's views. However, they are not used by the community members, who prefer to use community health workers as intermediaries. Fear of expressing oneself linked to the post-war context of Burundi, social and gender norms, and religious norms limit the expression of community members' views, especially those of women. The limited appreciation of community health workers by the providers further hampers communication and acceptance of the community's views by health providers.


CONCLUSION
In Burundi, the community voice to express views on maternal health services is encountering obstacles and needs to be strengthened,especially the women's voice. Community mobilization in the form of a mass immunization campaign day organized by women fora, and community empowerment using participatory approaches could contribute towards community voice strengthening.",29378564,2018,"""Ways and channels for voice regarding perceptions of maternal health care services within the communities of the Makamba and Kayanza provinces in the Republic of Burundi: an exploratory study""."
134,"BACKGROUND
Women with comorbid substance use disorders are an extremely vulnerable group having an increased relative risk of negative outcomes such as incarceration, morbidity and mortality. In Sweden, women with comorbid substance use disorders may be placed in compulsory care for substance abuse treatment. Clinical intake assessment procedures are a distinct aspect of clinical practice and are a foundation upon which client motivation and continued treatment occurs.


METHOD
The current study is a naturalistic quasi-experiment and aims to assess the five-year costs and benefits of a standard intake interview versus an extended psychological and psychiatric assessment for a group of chronic substance abusing women placed in compulsory care in Sweden between 1997 and 2000. Official register data on criminal activity, healthcare use, compulsory care stays and other services was retrieved and all resources used by study participants from date of index care episode was valued. In addition, the cost of providing the intake assessment was estimated.


RESULTS
Results show that the extended assessment resulted in higher net costs over five years of between 256,000 and 557,000 SEK per person for women placed in care via the Law on Compulsory Care for Substance Abusers (LVM). Higher assessment costs made up a portion of this cost. The majority of this cost (47-57%) falls on the local municipality (social welfare) and 11.6-13.7% falls on the individual patient.

135,"BACKGROUND
Pediatric providers are key players in the treatment of childhood obesity, yet rates of obesity management in the primary care setting are low. The goal of this study was to examine the views of pediatric providers on conducting obesity management in the primary care setting, and identify potential resources and care models that could facilitate delivery of this care.


METHODS
A mixed methods approach was utilized. Four focus groups were conducted with providers from a large pediatric network in San Diego County. Based on a priori and emerging themes, a questionnaire was developed and administered to the larger group of providers in this network.


RESULTS
Barriers to conducting obesity management fell into four categories: provider-level/individual (e.g., lack of knowledge and confidence), practice-based/systems-level (e.g., lack of time and resources), parent-level (e.g., poor motivation and follow-up), and environmental (e.g., lack of access to resources). Solutions centered around implementing a team approach to care (with case managers and health coaches) and electronic medical record changes to include best practice guidelines, increased ease of documentation, and delivery of standardized handouts/resources. Survey results revealed only 23.8% of providers wanted to conduct behavioral management of obesity. The most requested support was the introduction of a health educator in the office to deliver a brief behavioral intervention.

136,"BACKGROUND
Engagement with HIV medical care is critical to successful HIV treatment and prevention efforts. However, in Ukraine, delays in the timely initiation of HIV treatment hamper viral suppression. By January 01, 2016, only 126,604 (57.5%) of the estimated 220,000 people living with HIV (PLWH) had registered for HIV care, and most (55.1%) of those who registered for HIV care in 2015 did that at a late stage of infection. In the US, Anti-Retroviral Treatment and Access to Services (ARTAS) intervention successfully linked newly diagnosed PLWH to HIV services using strengths-based case management with a linkage coordinator. To tailor the ARTAS intervention for Ukraine, we conducted a qualitative study with patients and providers to understand barriers and facilitators that influence linkage to HIV care.


METHODS
During September-October 2014, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with HIV-positive patients and two focus groups with physicians in infectious disease, sexually transmitted infection (STI), and addiction clinics in Dnipropetrovsk Region of Ukraine. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We translated illustrative quotes into English. We used thematic analysis for the data analysis.


RESULTS
Participants (20 patients and 14 physicians) identified multiple, mostly individual-level factors influencing HIV care initiation. Key barriers included lack of HIV knowledge, non-acceptance of HIV diagnosis, fear of HIV disclosure, lack of psychological support from health providers, and HIV stigma in community. Responsibility for one's health, health deterioration, and supportive provider communication were reported as facilitators to linkage to care. Expected benefits from the case management intervention included psychological support, HIV education, and help with navigating the segmented health system.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings from the study will be used to optimize the ARTAS for the Ukrainian context. Our findings can also support future linkage-to-care strategies in other countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.",29378581,2018,Patient and provider perspectives inform an intervention to improve linkage to care for HIV patients in Ukraine.
137,"BACKGROUND
Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence is higher among Veterans in the United States. Based on our prior research, primary care teams at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital do not feel well-equipped to deliver effective weight management counseling and often lack sufficient time. Further, effective and intensive lifestyle-based weight management programs (e.g. VA MOVE! program) are underutilized despite implementation of systematic screening and referral at all VA sites. The 5As behavior change model (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange) is endorsed by the United States Preventive Service Task Force for use in counseling patients about weight management in primary care and reimbursed by Medicare. In this paper, we describe the iterative development of a technology-assisted intervention designed to provide primary care-based 5As counseling within Patient-Centered Medical Homes without overburdening providers/healthcare teams.


METHODS
Thematic analyses of prior formative work (focus groups with patients [n = 54] and key informant interviews with staff [n = 25]) helped to create a technology-assisted, health coaching intervention called Goals for Eating and Moving (GEM). To further develop the intervention, we then conducted two rounds of testing with previous formative study participants (n = 5 for Round 1, n = 5 for Round 2). Each session included usability testing of prototypes of the online GEM tool, pilot testing of 5As counseling by a Health Coach, and a post-session open-ended interview.


RESULTS
Three main themes emerged from usability data analyses: participants' emotional responses, tool language, and health literacy. Findings from both rounds of usability testing, pilot testing, as well as the open-ended interview data, were used to finalize protocols for the full intervention in the clinic setting to be conducted with Version 3 of the GEM tool.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of qualitative research methods and user-centered design approaches enabled timely detection of salient issues to make iterative improvements to the intervention. Future studies will determine whether this intervention can increase enrollment in intensive weight management programs and promote clinically meaningful weight loss in both Veterans and in other patient populations and health systems.",29378584,2018,Development of a 5As-based technology-assisted weight management intervention for veterans in primary care.
138,"INTRODUCTION
Low-back pain (LBP) has been correlated to the presence of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration on T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. It remains challenging, however, to accurately stage degenerative disc disease (DDD) based on T2w MRI and measurements of IVD height, particularly for early DDD. Several quantitative MRI techniques have been introduced to detect changes in matrix composition signifying early DDD. In this study, we correlated quantitative T2, T1rho and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values to disc mechanical behavior and gold standard early DDD markers in a graded degenerated lumbar IVD caprine model, to assess their potential for early DDD detection.


METHODS
Lumbar caprine IVDs were injected with either 0.25 U/ml or 0.5 U/ml Chondroïtinase ABC (Cabc) to trigger early DDD-like degeneration. Injection with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) served as control. IVDs were cultured in a bioreactor for 20 days under axial physiological loading. High-resolution 9.4 T MR images were obtained prior to intervention and after culture. Quantitative MR results were correlated to recovery behavior, histological degeneration grading, and the content of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and water.


RESULTS
Cabc-injected IVDs showed aberrancies in biomechanics and loss of GAGs without changes in water-content. All MR sequences detected changes in matrix composition, with T1rho showing largest changes pre-to-post in the nucleus, and significantly more than T2 and ADC. Histologically, degeneration due to Cabc injection was mild. T1rho nucleus values correlated strongest with altered biomechanics, histological degeneration score, and loss of GAGs.


CONCLUSIONS
T2- and T1rho quantitative MR-mapping detected early DDD changes. T1rho nucleus values correlated better than T2 and ADC with biomechanical, histological, and GAG changes. Clinical implementation of quantitative MRI, T1rho particularly, could aid in distinguishing DDD more reliably at an earlier stage in the degenerative process.",29381716,2018,"Quantitative MRI in early intervertebral disc degeneration: T1rho correlates better than T2 and ADC with biomechanics, histology and matrix content."
139,"Cerebral ischemia is the most common cause of stroke with high morbidity, disability and mortality. Sirtuin-2 (Sirt2), a vitally important NAD+-dependent deacetylase which has been widely researched in central nervous system diseases, has also been identified as a promising treatment target using its specific inhibitors such as AK-7. In this study, we found that P38 was specifically activated after focal cerebral ischemic injury, and it was also significantly activated after AK-7 administration in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. AK-7 decreased the infarction volume remarkably and promoted the recovery of neurological function efficiently in the mice evaluated by behavior tests. In contrast, pP38 inhibition increased the infarct volume and exacerbated the symptoms of paralysis. Herein, we suggest AK-7 improves the outcome of brain ischemia in dependence on the P38 activation in mice, which may serve as a strategy for the treatment of stroke.",29382550,2018,Neuroprotective Effect of Sirt2-specific Inhibitor AK-7 Against Acute Cerebral Ischemia is P38 Activation-dependent in Mice.
140,"Implicit moral evaluations-spontaneous, unintentional judgments about the moral status of actions or persons-are thought to play a pivotal role in moral experience, suggesting a need for research to model these moral evaluations in clinical populations. Prior research reveals that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a critical area underpinning affect and morality, and patients with vmPFC lesions show abnormalities in moral judgment and moral behavior. We use indirect measurement and multinomial modeling to understand differences in implicit moral evaluations among patients with vmPFC lesions. Our model quantifies multiple processes of moral judgment: implicit moral evaluations in response to distracting moral transgressions (Unintentional Judgment), accurate moral judgments about target actions (Intentional Judgment), and a directional tendency to judge actions as morally wrong (Response Bias). Compared to individuals with non-vmPFC brain damage and neurologically healthy comparisons, patients with vmPFC lesions showed a dual deficit in processes of moral judgment. First, patients with vmPFC lesions showed reduced Unintentional Judgment about moral transgressions, but not about non-moral negative affective distracters. Second, patients with vmPFC lesions showed reduced Intentional Judgment about target actions. These findings highlight the utility of a formal modeling approach in moral psychology, revealing a dual deficit in multiple component processes of moral judgment among patients with vmPFC lesions.",29382558,2018,Damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is associated with impairments in both spontaneous and deliberative moral judgments.
141,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE
Yokukansan is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has been approved in Japan as a remedy for neurosis, insomnia, and irritability in children. It has also been reported to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with various forms of dementia.


AIM OF THE STUDY
To evaluate the usefulness of co-treatment with an antidepressant and an herbal medicine in the psychiatric field, the current study examined the effect of yokukansan on the anxiolytic-like effect of fluvoxamine in mice.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The anxiolytic-like effect in mice was estimated by the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Contextual fear conditioning consisted of two sessions, i.e., day 1 for the conditioning session and day 2 for the test session. The expression levels of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor in the mouse brain regions were quantified by western blot analysis.


RESULTS
A single administration of fluvoxamine (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) before the test session dose-dependently and significantly suppressed freezing behavior in mice. In the combination study, a sub-effective dose of fluvoxamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly suppressed freezing behavior in mice that had been repeatedly pretreated with yokukansan (0.3 and 1 g/kg, p.o.) once a day for 6 days after the conditioning session. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of 5-HT2A receptor was specifically decreased in the prefrontal cortex of mice that had been administered yokukansan and fluvoxamine. Furthermore, microinjection of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 nmol/mouse) into the prefrontal cortex significantly suppressed freezing behavior.


CONCLUSION
The present findings indicate that repeated treatment with yokukansan synergistically enhances the anxiolytic-like effect of fluvoxamine in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm in mice in conjunction with a decrease in 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, combination therapy with fluvoxamine and yokukansan may be beneficial for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",29382554,2018,"Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, enhances the anxiolytic effect of fluvoxamine and reduces cortical 5-HT2A receptor expression in mice."
142,"BACKGROUND
Despite the near ubiquity of mobile phones, little research has been conducted on the implementation of mobile health (mHealth) apps to treat patients in primary care. Although primary care clinicians routinely treat chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes, they rarely treat addiction, a common chronic condition. Instead, addiction is most often treated in the US health care system, if it is treated at all, in a separate behavioral health system. mHealth could help integrate addiction treatment in primary care.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this paper was to report the effects of implementing an mHealth system for addiction in primary care on both patients and clinicians.


METHODS
In this implementation research trial, an evidence-based mHealth system named Seva was introduced sequentially over 36 months to a maximum of 100 patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) in each of three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs; primary care clinics that serve patients regardless of their ability to pay). This paper reports on patient and clinician outcomes organized according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.


RESULTS
The outcomes according to the RE-AIM framework are as follows: Reach-Seva reached 8.31% (268/3226) of appropriate patients. Reach was limited by our ability to pay for phones and data plans for a maximum of 100 patients per clinic. Effectiveness-Patients who were given Seva had significant improvements in their risky drinking days (44% reduction, (0.7-1.25)/1.25, P=.04), illicit drug-use days (34% reduction, (2.14-3.22)/3.22, P=.01), quality of life, human immunodeficiency virus screening rates, and number of hospitalizations. Through Seva, patients also provided peer support to one another in ways that are novel in primary care settings. Adoption-Patients sustained high levels of Seva use-between 53% and 60% of the patients at the 3 sites accessed Seva during the last week of the 12-month implementation period. Among clinicians, use of the technology was less robust than use by patients, with only a handful of clinicians using Seva in each clinic and behavioral health providers making most referrals to Seva in 2 of the 3 clinics. Implementation-At 2 sites, implementation plans were realized successfully; they were delayed in the third. Maintenance-Use of Seva dropped when grant funding stopped paying for the mobile phones and data plans. Two of the 3 clinics wanted to maintain the use of Seva, but they struggled to find funding to support this.


CONCLUSIONS
Implementing an mHealth system can improve care among primary care patients with SUDs, and patients using the system can support one another in their recovery. Among clinicians, however, implementation requires figuring out how information from the mHealth system will be used and making mHealth data available in the electronic health (eHealth) record. In addition, paying for an mHealth system remains a challenge.",29382624,2018,Implementing a Mobile Health System to Integrate the Treatment of Addiction Into Primary Care: A Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness Study.
143,"OBJECTIVE
This study examined specialty behavioral health treatment patterns among employer-insured adults in same- and different-gender domestic partnerships and marriages.


METHODS
The study used behavioral health service claims (2008-2013) from Optum to estimate gender-stratified penetration rates of behavioral health service use by couple type and partnership status among partnered adults ages 18-64 (N=12,727,292 person-years) and levels of use among those with any use (conditional analyses). Least-squares, logistic, and zero-truncated negative binomial regression analyses adjusted for age, employer and plan characteristics, and provider supply and for sociodemographic factors in sensitivity analyses. Generalized estimating equations were used to address within-group correlation of adults clustered in employer groups.


RESULTS
Both women and men in same-gender marriages or domestic partnerships had higher rates of behavioral health service use, particularly diagnostic evaluation, individual psychotherapy, and medication management, and those in treatment had, on average, more psychotherapy visits than those in different-gender marriages. Behavioral health treatment patterns were similar between women in same-gender domestic partnerships and same-gender marriages, but they diverged between men in same-gender domestic partnerships and same-gender marriages. Moderation analysis results indicated that adults with same-gender partners living in states with fewer legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons were less likely than adults with same-gender partners in LGBT-friendly states to receive behavioral health treatment. Sensitivity analyses did not affect findings.

Behavioral health treatment patterns varied by couple type, partnership status, and gender. Results highlight the importance of increasing service acceptability and delivering inclusive, culturally relevant behavioral health treatment for lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons.",29385953,2018,Behavioral Health Treatment Patterns Among Employer-Insured Adults in Same- and Different-Gender Marriages and Domestic Partnerships.
144,"While some studies have assessed patient recall of important information from ambulatory care visits, none has done so recently. Furthermore, little is known about features of clinical interactions which are associated with patient understanding and recall, without which shared decision making, a widely shared ideal for patient care, cannot occur. Our objective was to evaluate characteristics of patients and outpatient encounters associated with patient recall of information after one week, along with observation of elements of shared decision making. This was an observational study based on coded transcripts of 189 outpatient encounters, and post-visit interviews with patients 1 week later. Coding used three previously validated systems, adopted for this study. Forty-nine percent of decisions and recommendations were recalled accurately without prompting; 36% recalled with a prompt; 15% recalled erroneously or not at all. Provider behaviors hypothesized to be associated with patient recall, such as open-questioning and ""teach back,"" were rare. Patients with less than high school education recalled 38% of items freely and accurately, while patients with a college degree recalled 65% (p < .0001). In a multivariate model, the total number of items to be recalled per visit, and percentage of utterances in decision-making processes by the provider (""verbal dominance""), were significant predictors of poorer recall. The item count was associated with poorer recall for lower, but not higher, educated patients.",29389994,2018,Factors associated with patient recall of key information in ambulatory specialty care visits: Results of an innovative methodology.
145,"In optogenetics, rhodopsins were established as light-driven tools to manipulate neuronal activity. However, during long-term photostimulation using channelrhodopsin (ChR), desensitization can reduce effects. Furthermore, requirement for continuous presence of the chromophore all-trans retinal (ATR) in model systems lacking sufficient endogenous concentrations limits its applicability. We tested known, and engineered and characterized new variants of de- and hyperpolarizing rhodopsins in Caenorhabditis elegans. ChR2 variants combined previously described point mutations that may synergize to enable prolonged stimulation. Following brief light pulses ChR2(C128S;H134R) induced muscle activation for minutes or even for hours ('Quint': ChR2(C128S;L132C;H134R;D156A;T159C)), thus featuring longer open state lifetime than previously described variants. Furthermore, stability after ATR removal was increased compared to the step-function opsin ChR2(C128S). The double mutants C128S;H134R and H134R;D156C enabled increased effects during repetitive stimulation. We also tested new hyperpolarizers (ACR1, ACR2, ACR1(C102A), ZipACR). Particularly ACR1 and ACR2 showed strong effects in behavioral assays and very large currents with fast kinetics. In sum, we introduce highly light-sensitive optogenetic tools, bypassing previous shortcomings, and thus constituting new tools that feature high effectiveness and fast kinetics, allowing better repetitive stimulation or investigating prolonged neuronal activity states in C. elegans and, possibly, other systems.",29389997,2018,Rhodopsin optogenetic toolbox v2.0 for light-sensitive excitation and inhibition in Caenorhabditis elegans.
146,"Physical activity behavior varies naturally from day to day, from week to week and even across seasons. In order to assess the habitual level of physical activity of a person, the person must be monitored for long enough so that the level can be identified, taking into account this natural within-person variation. An important question, and one whose answer has implications for study- and survey design, epidemiological research and population surveillance, is, for how long does an individual need to be monitored before such a habitual level or pattern can be identified to a desired level of precision? The aim of this study was to estimate the number of repeated observations needed to identify the habitual physical activity behaviour of an individual to a given degree of precision. A convenience sample of 50 Swedish adults wore accelerometers during four consecutive weeks. The number of days needed to come within 5-50% of an individual's usual physical activity 95% of the time was calculated. To get an idea of the uncertainty of the estimates all statistical estimates were bootstrapped 2000 times. The mean number of days of measurement needed for the observation to, with 95% confidence, be within 20% of the habitual physical activity of an individual is highest for vigorous physical activity, for which 182 days are needed. For sedentary behaviour the equivalent number of days is 2.4. To capture 80% of the sample to within ±20% of their habitual level of physical activity, 3.4 days is needed if sedentary behavior is the outcome of interest, and 34.8 days for MVPA. The present study shows that for analyses requiring accurate data at the individual level a longer measurement collection period than the traditional 7-day protocol should be used. In addition, the amount of MVPA was negatively associated with the number of days required to identify the habitual physical activity level indicating that the least active are also those whose habitual physical activity level is the most difficult to identify. These results could have important implications for researchers whose aim is to analyse data on an individual level. Before recommendations regarding an appropriate monitoring protocol are updated, the present study should be replicated in different populations.",29390010,2018,The number of repeated observations needed to estimate the habitual physical activity of an individual to a given level of precision.
147,"Some of the neurobehavioral deficits identified in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) have been recapitulated in a binge model of gestational third trimester-equivalent ethanol (EtOH) exposure, in which Sprague-Dawley rats are intragastrically intubated between post-natal day (PD) 4 and PD9 with high doses of EtOH. In this model, the ameliorating effects of choline (Chol) administration on hippocampus-dependent behaviors altered by EtOH have also been extensively documented. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EtOH (5 g/kg/day) and/or Chol (100 mg/kg/day) on morphometric parameters of CA1 pyramidal neurons by Golgi-Cox staining followed by Neurolucida tracing and analysis. We found that EtOH increased apical dendrite complexity in male and female pups neonatally exposed to EtOH. EtOH did not significantly affect basal dendrite parameters in female and male rats. Interestingly, Chol treatments decreased basal dendrites' length, number, and maximal terminal distance in male pups. When pups were co-treated with EtOH and Chol, Chol did not rescue the effect of EtOH. In conclusion, EtOH increases while Chol decreases dendritic length and arborization of hippocampal CA1 neurons in PD9 rats. We hypothesize that developmental EtOH exposure induces a premature maturation of neurons, leading to early restriction of neuronal plasticity while Chol treatments delay the normal program of neuronal maturation and therefore prolong the window of maximal plasticity. Chol does not prevent the effects of developmental alcohol exposure on hippocampal pyramidal neurons' morphology characterized in the present study, although whether prolonged Chol administration after developmental EtOH exposure rectifies EtOH damage remains to be assessed.",29391132,2018,Neonatal Ethanol and Choline Treatments Alter the Morphology of Developing Rat Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons in Opposite Directions.
148,"The accumulation efficiency and the properties of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) produced from acidified waste glycerol (AWG) and its derivatives via an enriched microbial consortium derived from soil, were investigated in this study. AWG consisted mainly from short chain fatty acids, 1,3 propanediol and residual glycerol, which were also evaluated individually as substrates. Accumulation capacity and yields were estimated after solvent extraction and purification and PHAs were further analyzed in terms of their chemical structure, thermal properties, molecular masses and mechanical properties. The lowest accumulation capacity was noticed for non-acidified waste glycerol as carbon source which led to the generation of P(3HB), whereas for the other carbon sources co-polymers of 3HB with 3HV or 3HHx were produced. Average molecular mass weights were quite high in all cases reaching ~1.8×106Da. The thermal properties and the mechanical behavior of PHAs were shown to be highly affected by their monomeric composition, whereas it was also concluded that DSC and DMA results were in good agreement.",29391227,2018,Comparison of yields and properties of microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates generated from waste glycerol based substrates.
149,"The phase behavior of aqueous systems containing hyaluronan, at concentrations between 2 and 100 mg/L, and oppositely charged surfactants was investigated. A fluorescence probe technique revealed the formation of micellar structures on the hyaluronan in homogeneous systems well below the surfactant standard, critical, micellar concentration. Moreover, regions of gel-phase separation were revealed. A detailed phase diagram was, thus, constructed in the very diluted region and the hyaluronan concentration was found to be the main parameter controlling the phase behavior, in contrast to the charge ratio. The stability of hyaluronan-surfactant aggregates in the homogeneous systems while in storage at 4 °C (up to three months), against dilution, salt addition and on heating-cooling (between 10 and 50 °C) was also investigated. The aggregates were stable while in storage or upon increasing and decreasing the temperature. The dilution of hyaluronan-surfactant complexes or the addition of 0.15 M NaCl led to their disintegration. Finally, systems prepared in a 0.15 M NaCl solution showed that interactions are suppressed and no aggregation below the standard critical micellar concentration was observed.",29391230,2018,Interactions of hyaluronan with oppositely charged surfactants in very diluted solutions in water.
150,"Adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to incentives and relatively weak cognitive control, which may contribute to risky behaviors. Studies of brain activity have generally identified greater activation of the ventral striatum to rewards and less activation of prefrontal regions during control tasks in adolescents compared to adults. Little is known, however, about age-related changes in the functional brain networks underlying incentive processing and cognitive control. This cross-sectional study characterized the effects of incentives on inhibitory control during an oculomotor task using whole-brain functional connectivity analyses. During an fMRI scan, one hundred forty typically developing individuals completed an incentivized antisaccade task consisting of incentive cue, preparation, and response phases. We found that task modulation of control networks increased gradually from childhood to adulthood, whereas a network including ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex displayed an adolescent-specific peak in response to the receipt of outcomes, consistent with dual-systems models. Notably, however, greater modulation of salience and motor networks during the preparation phase mediated age-related improvements in antisaccade accuracy, whereas adolescent enhancement of value-related circuitry did not. Relative to neutral cues, both reward and loss cues enhanced task-related connectivity of the salience network when preparing to inhibit a saccade. Altogether, our findings suggest that incentives facilitate inhibitory control by enhancing the salience of one's responses and that over development, the recruitment of functional networks involved in saliency and motor preparation supports better performance.",29391243,2018,Incentives facilitate developmental improvement in inhibitory control by modulating control-related networks.

152,"The policy positions parties choose are central to both attracting voters and forming coalition governments. How then should parties choose positions to best represent voters? Laver and Sergenti show that in an agent-based model with boundedly rational actors a decision rule (Aggregator) that takes the mean policy position of its supporters is the best rule to achieve high congruence between voter preferences and party positions. But this result only pertains to representation by the legislature, not representation by the government. To evaluate this we add a coalition formation procedure with boundedly rational parties to the Laver and Sergenti model of party competition. We also add two new decision rules that are sensitive to government formation outcomes rather than voter positions. We develop two simulations: a single-rule one in which parties with the same rule compete and an evolutionary simulation in which parties with different rules compete. In these simulations we analyze party behavior under a large number of different parameters that describe real-world variance in political parties' motives and party system characteristics. Our most important conclusion is that Aggregators also produce the best match between government policy and voter preferences. Moreover, even though citizens often frown upon politicians' interest in the prestige and rents that come with winning political office (office pay-offs), we find that citizens actually receive better representation by the government if politicians are motivated by these office pay-offs in contrast to politicians with ideological motivations (policy pay-offs). Finally, we show that while more parties are linked to better political representation, how parties choose policy positions affects political representation as well. Overall, we conclude that to understand variation in the quality of political representation scholars should look beyond electoral systems and take into account variation in party behavior as well.",29394268,2018,Governator vs. Hunter and Aggregator: A simulation of party competition with vote-seeking and office-seeking rules.
153,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
With the introduction of insomnia disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), greater emphasis has been placed on the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorder even in the presence of a coexisting mental disorder. The current study seeks to explore the clinical picture of insomnia in the context of psychiatric disorders commonly associated with sleep complaints by assessing the prevalence and correlates of DSM-5 insomnia disorder, and examining the extent to which insomnia symptoms have been addressed in this population.


METHODS
Four hundred treatment-seeking outpatients suffering from depressive, bipolar affective, anxiety, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited. DSM-5 insomnia was established using the modified Brief Insomnia Questionnaire. Differences in sociodemographic factors, clinical status, impairment outcomes, and mental health services utilization were compared. Information on patients' help-seeking experiences for insomnia-related symptoms was collected to determine the treatment received and treatment effectiveness.


RESULTS
Almost one-third of our sample (31.8%) had DSM-5 insomnia disorder. Those with insomnia disorder had significantly higher impairment outcomes than their counterparts but no group difference was observed for mental health services utilization. Findings based on past treatment contact for sleep problems suggest that diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is lacking in this population.


CONCLUSIONS
With the new calling from DSM-5, clinicians treating psychiatric patients should view insomnia less as a symptom of their mental illnesses and treat clinical insomnia as a primary disorder. Patients should also be educated on the importance of reporting and treating their sleep complaints. Nonmedical (cognitive and behavioral) interventions for insomnia need to be further explored given their proven clinical effectiveness.",29394962,2018,Evaluating DSM-5 Insomnia Disorder and the Treatment of Sleep Problems in a Psychiatric Population.
154,"BACKGROUND
The primary objectives of HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) phase 1 preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials are to assess safety and immune response to study products. Participant alcohol and drug use may affect adherence, retention, and risk of HIV infection. Data on the effects of substance use are limited to medical care compliance and treatment adherence in HIV infected participants. To our knowledge, there are no data assessing substance use and retention in these vaccine trials.


METHODS
We performed a meta-analysis on substance use and its impact on retention in HVTN phase I trials that recruited participants demonstrating lower risk profiles for HIV infection. Our analysis included data from 10 HVTN phase 1 clinical trials conducted between February 2009 and September 2014 in the Americas and Switzerland that utilized the identical interviewer-administered behavioral risk assessment questionnaire to capture participant self-report of substance use in the previous six months. Chi Square tests were used to assess statistical differences between variables.


RESULTS
Among the 964 participants, 170 (18%) missed a clinic visit and 78 (8%) terminated early from clinic follow-up; 75/774 (10%) on studies with multiple vaccination timepoints did not complete their vaccinations. Neither frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana, nor other drug use reported at screening visits were associated with the three adherence/retention measures. Binge drinking was associated with higher rates of unprotected sex while drunk (p < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
Light to moderate alcohol use does not negatively impact adherence or retention in phase I clinical trials. Based on these screening data and the low infection rate of participants during the trial period, the screening process for participation in HVTN phase 1 trials has largely been successful in enrolling and retaining individuals with lower risk profiles. Focusing on binge drinking and increased HIV/STI risk during risk reduction counseling may be warranted.",29395528,2018,"Substance use patterns of HVTN phase I clinical trial participants: Enrollment, risk reduction counseling and retention."

Thus, early onset smokers (EOS; initiated <16 years old) may be at unique risk of altered development of executive function relative to late onset smokers (LOS; initiated >16 years old). This study quantified the effects of age of smoking onset on response impulsivity and inhibitory control using a novel smoking Go/NoGo task (Luijten et al., 2011).


METHODS
Nicotine deprived adult EOS (n = 10) and LOS (n = 10) and adult healthy non-smokers (HNS; n = 10) were shown smoking-related and neutral images with either a blue (Go) or yellow (NoGo) frame. Participants were instructed to respond to blue-framed Go trials quickly and accurately, and withhold responding for yellow-framed NoGo trials.


RESULTS
EOS made more Go response accuracy errors (p ≤ 0.02) and failed more frequently to inhibit responses to NoGo trials (p < 0.02) than LOS and HNS. EOS also made more errors in inhibiting responses to smoking-related (p ≤ 0.02) and neutral (p ≤ 0.02) NoGo trials. EOS reported greater baseline craving for cigarette smoking than LOS (p < 0.04), and craving was significantly associated with greater omission errors (p ≤ 0.04).


CONCLUSIONS
EOS exhibited greater difficulty than LOS in responding accurately to Go stimuli and withholding responses to both smoking and neutral NoGo stimuli, indicating greater response impulsivity, poor attention, and deficits in response inhibition. These findings suggest that EO smoking, in particular, contributes to diminished task-related attention and inhibitory control behaviors in adulthood and provide support for the tobacco-induced neurotoxicity of adolescent cognitive development (TINACD) theory (DeBry and Tiffany, 2008).",29402679,2018,Early onset tobacco cigarette smokers exhibit deficits in response inhibition and sustained attention.
156,"BACKGROUND
Methamphetamine (MA) abuse causes immune dysfunction and neuropsychiatric impairment. The mechanisms underlying these deficits remain unidentified.


METHODS
The effects of MA on anxiety-like behavior and immune function were investigated in mice selectively bred to voluntarily consume high amounts of MA [i.e., MA high drinking (MAHDR) mice]. MA (or saline) was administered to mice using a chronic (14-day), binge-like model. Performance in the elevated zero maze (EZM) was determined 5 days after the last MA dose to examine anxiety-like behavior. Cytokine and chemokine expressions were measured in the hippocampus using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Human studies were also conducted to evaluate symptoms of anxiety using the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale in adults with and without a history of MA dependence. Plasma samples collected from human research participants were used for confirmatory analysis of murine qPCR results using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.


RESULTS
During early remission from MA, MAHDR mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior on the EZM and reduced expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (ccl3) in the hippocampus relative to saline-treated mice. Human adults actively dependent on MA and those in early remission had elevated symptoms of anxiety as well as reductions in plasma levels of CCL3, relative to adults with no history of MA abuse.


CONCLUSIONS
The results highlight the complex effects of MA on immune and behavioral function and suggest that alterations in CCL3 signaling may contribute to the mood impairments observed during remission from MA addiction.",29402784,2018,Parallel Effects of Methamphetamine on Anxiety and CCL3 in Humans and a Genetic Mouse Model of High Methamphetamine Intake.

The successful hyphenation of high-Performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) has been applied widely in TCMs and biological samples analysis. Undoubtedly, HPLC/MS technique has facilitated the understanding of the treatment mechanism of TCMs. We reviewed more than 350 published papers within the last 5 years on HPLC/MS in the analysis of TCMs. The present review focused on the applications of HPLC/MS in the component analysis, metabolites analysis, and pharmacokinetics of TCMs etc. 50% of the literature is related to the component analysis of TCMs, which show that this field is the most populär type of research. In the metabolites analysis, HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry has been demonstrated to be the powerful tool for the characterization of structural features and fragmentation behavior patterns.

158,"A new microfluidic system with four different microchambers (a circle and three equilateral concave polygons) was designed and fabricated using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and the soft lithography method. Using this microfluidic device at six flow rates (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μL/h), the effects of microenvironmental geometry and aqueous flow on bacterial adhesion behaviors were investigated. Escherichia coli HB101 pGLO, which could produce a green fluorescent protein induced by l-arabinose, was utilized as the model bacteria. The results demonstrated that bacterial adhesion was significantly related to culture time, microenvironment geometry, and aqueous flow rates. Adhered bacterial density increased with the culture time. Initially, the adhesion occurred at the microchamber sides, and then the entire chamber was gradually covered with increased culture time. Adhesion densities in the side zones were larger than those in the center zones because of the lower shearing force in the side zone. Also, the adhesion densities in the complex chambers were larger than those in the simple chambers. At low flow rates, the orientation of adhered bacteria was random and disorderly. At high flow rates, bacterial orientation became close to the streamline and oriented toward the flow direction. All these results implied that bacterial adhesion tended to occur in complicated aqueous flow areas. The present study provided an on-chip flow system for physiological behavior of biological cells, as well as provided a strategic cue for the prevention of bacterial infection and biofilm formation.",29403696,2011,Microfluidics-based assay on the effects of microenvironmental geometry and aqueous flow on bacterial adhesion behaviors.

163,"The stereoselective hydrolysis of esmolol in whole blood and in its separated components from rat, rabbit and human was investigated. Blood esterase activities were variable in different species in the order of rat>rabbit>human. Rat plasma showed the high esterase activity and had no stereoselectivity to enantiomers. Rabbit red blood cell (RBC) membrane, RBC cytosol and plasma all hydrolyzed esmolol but with different esterase activity, whereas the hydrolysis in RBC membrane and cytosol showed significant stereoselectivity towards R-(+)-esmolol. Esterase in RBC cytosol from human blood mainly contributed to the esmolol hydrolysis, which was demonstrated with no stereoselctivity. Esterase in human plasma showed a low activity, but a remarkable stereoselectivity with R-(+)-esmolol. In addition, the protein concentration affected the hydrolysis behavior of esmolol in RBC suspension. Protein binding of esmolol enantiomers in human plasma, human serum albumin (HSA) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) revealed that there was a significant difference in bound fractions between two enantiomers, especially for AGP. Our results indicated that the stereoselective protein binding might play a role in the different hydrolysis rates of esmolol enantiomers in human plasma.",29403746,2012,Analysis of species-dependent hydrolysis and protein binding of esmolol enantiomers.

Notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rg1, Re, Rb1 and Rd are the major active constituents of Sanqi. The purpose of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of the five active constituents from total saponin from Sanqi when it was used in the blood stasis animals or in combination with Gegen. The concentrations of the five active constituents in rat plasma were determined by an ultra-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. The main pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and statistically analyzed using the unpaired student's t-test.

The separation and determination was performed on a C18 column under the optimal chromatographic conditions. Several factors influencing the extraction efficiency of CPZ, such as pH, surfactant and adsorbent amounts, ionic strength, extraction time, sample volume and desorption conditions, were studied and optimized. Under the optimal MSPE conditions, the extraction percentage of CPZ was 74%, 27% and 16% in water, urine and plasma samples, respectively. The limits of detection (LODs) of the proposed approach were 0.1, 5.0 and 10 ng/mL in water, urine and plasma samples, respectively.

172,"Environmental factors during early life stages affect behavioral and physiological phenotypes in adulthood. We examined the effect of photoperiods during development on neurogenesis and affective behaviors during adolescence/adulthood using C57BL/6J mice. Mice were born and raised until weaning under long-day conditions (LDs) or short-day conditions (SDs), followed by a 12L12D cycle until adulthood. Adult mice born under SD showed a shorter latency to first immobility in the forced swim test when compared with the mice born under LD. The mice born under SD also exhibited significantly lower prepulse inhibition, which is a characteristic of schizophrenia. However, the mice exposed to SD and LD during the prenatal period only did not show differences in prepulse inhibition. At 4 weeks of age, there were less 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of mice born under SD when compared with mice born under LD. Double immunostaining showed that the mice born under SD showed less BrdU/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocyte marker) cells when compared with mice born under LD. Furthermore, expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the DG was higher in mice born under SD, and the photoperiod-dependent changes in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the DG were abolished by administration of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the photoperiod in early life alters astrogenesis in the hippocampus via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and may relate to affective behaviors in adulthood.",29406270,2018,"Early-life Photoperiod Influences Depression-like Behavior, Prepulse Inhibition of the Acoustic Startle Response, and Hippocampal Astrogenesis in Mice."

No changes were observed in the HBT or the OFT. FTL (0.25mg/kg) increased the number of entries into enclosed arms in the PMT. FTL reduced immobility in the TST (0.25 and 0.5mg/kg) and the FST (0.25mg/kg; 0.5mg/kg). The effect of FTL was dependent on carbohydrate interaction and protein structure integrity and was reduced by ketamine, l-NAME, aminoguanidine, 7-NI and methylene blue, but not by l-arginine, yohimbine or dl-serine. The antidepressant-like effect remained after subchronic treatment. The molecular docking study revealed a strong interaction between FTL and NOS and NMDA.

Although moral concerns vary widely across cultures, to this date, food wasting moral judgments were investigated only among rich and industrialized ones. This study reports first evidence of cultural variability on moral judgments of food wasting between modern and traditional cultures.

177,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a poorly understood symptom affecting many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite growing evidence of a behavioral link between anxiety, attention and FOG in PD, no research to date has investigated the neural mechanisms that might explain this relationship. The present study therefore examined resting-state MRI functional connectivity between the amygdala, striatum and frontoparietal attentional control network in PD patients with (freezers: n = 19) and without FOG (non-freezers: n = 21) in the dopaminergic 'off' state. Functional connectivity was subsequently correlated with an objective measure of FOG severity and a subjective scale of affective disorder within each group. Connectivity between the right amygdala and right putamen was significantly increased in freezers compared to non-freezers (p < 0.01). Furthermore, freezers showed increased anti-coupling between the frontoparietal network and left amygdala (p = 0.011), but reduced anti-coupling between this network and the right putamen (p = 0.027) as compared to non-freezers. Key functional connections between the amygdala, putamen and frontoparietal network were significantly associated with FOG severity and a fear of falling. This study provides the first evidence that dysfunctional fronto-striato-limbic processes may underpin the link between anxiety and FOG in PD. It is proposed that freezers have heightened striato-limbic load and reduced top-down attentional control at rest, which when further challenged by the parallel processing demands of walking may precipitate FOG.",29408498,2018,Dysfunctional Limbic Circuitry Underlying Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease.
178,"The present in-vivo study investigated the behavior and performance of differently charged poly(lactic‑co‑glycolic) acid microparticles (PLGA MP) as vaccination platform. For this purpose, particles loaded with ovalbumin (OVA) as model antigen were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected in SKH1 mice. The utilized SKH1 hairless mice exhibit a fully operative immune system and allow parallel imaging investigations due to the lack of hair. Usage of this species enabled the combination of two investigations within a single study protocol, namely noninvasive in-vivo imaging and immune responses directed towards the antigen. All treatments were well tolerated, no safety drop-outs occurred. The fate of the model antigen OVA as well as the PLGA particles was monitored using a dual dye approach (CF660C & DiR) by multispectral fluorescence imaging (msFI). A depot effect for the OVA antigen adsorbed to the MP surface could be observed for the positively charged MPs. The immune response against OVA was then analyzed. OVA alone did not induce an immune response, whereas the positively charged as well as the neutral MP induced a strong and consistent humoral immune response with a clear favor of IgG1 over IgG2a subclass antibodies. In contrast, negatively charged MP were not able to induce measurable antibody responses. Cellular immune response was weak and inconsistent for all treated groups, which verifies previous in-vitro results conducted with the herein described microparticulate antigen platform. In conclusion, the characterization of the in-vivo performance yielded valuable information about antigen and carrier fate after application. The presented adjuvant platform is capable of inducing strong TH2 dominated immune responses characterized by enhanced IgG1 subclass titers which are critical for vaccines aimed at promoting induction of neutralizing antibodies.",29408551,2018,"Dual dye in-vivo imaging of differentially charged PLGA carriers reveals antigen-depot effect, leading to improved immune responses in preclinical models."
179,"Sodium alginate (SA)/hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)/hydroxyapatite (HA) composite scaffolds were explored for enhanced in vitro bone regeneration. The SA/HEC/HA composites were synthesized using the lyophilization technique and further cross-linked in the presence of calcium ions to form composite hydrogel networks. The physicochemical, thermal behavior and morphology properties of the prepared scaffolds were characterized through XRD, DSC/TGA, FTIR and SEM. Furthermore, the mechanical behavior of the under investigated scaffolds was determined using texture analyzer. The in vitro bioactivity in SBF and adsorption of bovine serum albumin as well as cell viability for all the prepared scaffolds were also tested. The results indicated that the higher HA concentration (40wt%) enhanced the mechanical properties (23.9MPa), bioactivity and protein adsorption.

180,"Errors in human behavior elicit a cascade of brain activity related to performance monitoring and error detection. Whereas the early error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) has been assumed to reflect a fast mismatch or prediction error signal in the medial frontal cortex, the later error positivity (Pe) is viewed as a correlate of conscious error processing. A still open question is whether these components represent two independent systems of error monitoring that rely on different types of information to detect an error. Here, we investigated the prediction that the Ne/ERN but not the Pe requires a representation of the correct response to emerge. To this end, we created a condition in which no information about the correct response was available while error detection was still possible. We hypothesized that a Pe, but no Ne/ERN should be obtained in this case. Participants had to classify targets but ignore flankers that were always associated with an incorrect response. Targets but not flankers were masked with varying target-masking intervals. Crucially, on some trials no target at all was presented, thus preventing the representation of a correct response and the emergence of an Ne/ERN. However, because flankers were easily visible and responses to the flankers were always incorrect, detection of these flanker errors was still possible. In line with predictions of a multiple-systems account, we observed a robust Pe in the absence of an Ne/ERN for these errors. Moreover, this Pe relied on the same neural activity as that on trials with a visible target, as revealed by multivariate pattern analysis. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms reflected by the two components use different types of information to detect errors, providing evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.",29409999,2018,Errors can elicit an error positivity in the absence of an error negativity: Evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.
181,"The goal of childhood obesity lifestyle interventions are to positively change body composition, however it is unknown if interventions also modulate factors that are related to energy intake. This study aimed to examine changes in eating behaviors and plasma leptin concentrations in overweight and obese children participating in a 1-year family-centered lifestyle intervention. Interventions were based on Canadian diet and physical activity (PA) guidelines. Children were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: Control (Ctrl; no intervention), Standard treatment (StnTx: 2 servings milk and alternatives/day (d), 3x/wk weight-bearing PA), or Modified treatment (ModTx: 4 servings milk and alternatives/day; daily weight-bearing PA). Study visits occurred every 3-months for 1-y; interventions were held once a month for 6-months with one follow-up visit at 8-months. Ctrl received counselling after 1-y. Caregivers completed the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) and reported on diet and activity. Plasma leptin were measured from morning fasted blood samples. Seventy-eight children (mean age 7.8 ± 0.8 y; mean BMI 24.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated; 94% completed the study. Compared to baseline, at 6-months StnTx reduced Emotional Overeating and Desire to Drink scores (p < 0.05) while Food Responsiveness scores were reduced in both StnTx and ModTx (p < 0.05). At 1-year, scores for Desire to Drink in StnTx remained reduced compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Plasma leptin concentrations were significantly lower in ModTx at 6-months compared to baseline (p < 0.05).

182,"Based on cue reactivity theory, food cues embedded in media content can lead to physiological and psychological responses in children. Research suggests that unhealthy food cues are represented more extensively and interactively in children's media environments than healthy ones. However, it is not clear to this date whether children react differently to unhealthy compared to healthy food cues. In an experimental study with 56 children (55.4% girls; Mage = 8.00, SD = 1.58), we used eye-tracking to determine children's attention to unhealthy and healthy food cues embedded in a narrative cartoon movie. Besides varying the food type (i.e., healthy vs. unhealthy), we also manipulated the integration levels of food cues with characters (i.e., level of food integration; no interaction vs. handling vs. consumption), and we assessed children's individual susceptibility factors by measuring the impact of their hunger level. Our results indicated that unhealthy food cues attract children's visual attention to a larger extent than healthy cues. However, their initial visual interest did not differ between unhealthy and healthy food cues. Furthermore, an increase in the level of food integration led to an increase in visual attention. Our findings showed no moderating impact of hunger. We conclude that especially unhealthy food cues with an interactive connection trigger cue reactivity in children.",29410047,2018,A treat for the eyes.

183,"The permeabilization of biological membranes by electric fields, known as electroporation, has been traditionally performed with square electric pulses. These signals distribute the energy applied to cells in a wide frequency band. This paper investigates the use of sine waves, which are narrow band signals, to provoke electropermeabilization and the frequency dependence of this phenomenon. Single bursts of sine waves at different frequencies in the range from 8 kHz-130 kHz were applied to cells in vitro. Electroporation was studied in the plasma membrane and the internal organelles membrane using calcium as a permeabilization marker. Additionally, a double-shell electrical model was simulated to give a theoretical framework to our results. The electroporation efficiency shows a low pass filter frequency dependence for both the plasma membrane and the internal organelles membrane. The mismatch between the theoretical response and the observed behavior for the internal organelles membrane is explained by a two-step permeabilization process: first the permeabilization of the external membrane and afterwards that of the internal membranes. The simulations in the model confirm this two-step hypothesis when a variable plasma membrane conductivity is considered in the analysis. This study demonstrates how the use of narrow-band signals as sine waves is a suitable method to perform electroporation in a controlled manner. We suggest that the use of this type of signals could bring a simplification in the investigations of the very complex phenomenon of electroporation, thus representing an interesting option in future fundamental studies.",29410049,2018,Sine wave electropermeabilization reveals the frequency-dependent response of the biological membranes.
184,"In North America, more than 70 species of natural enemies are available for pest control, including the aphid predators, Adalia bipunctata L. (two-spotted lady beetle) and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville (convergent lady beetle), and the generalist predator Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (green lacewing). The two lady beetle species are known to host microsporidian pathogens: Nosema adaliae was originally described from Adalia bipunctata and Tubulinosema hippodamiae from H. convergens. Microsporidia are spore-forming pathogens that typically produce chronic, debilitating disease. Because the spores of both pathogens are transovarially transmitted through beetle eggs, the predation behavior of lacewing larvae provides an opportunity for the transmission of these pathogens when infected lady beetles and lacewings share the same local environment. In this study, uninfected and microsporidia-infected eggs from A. bipunctata and H. convergens were offered to C. carnea larvae. The development of larvae that consumed N. adaliae-infected eggs was not affected, but larval development was prolonged by almost 3 days for those that consumed two or more T. hippodamiae-infected eggs. Prolonged larval development is considered to be costly because larvae remain vulnerable to cannibalization by sibling larvae or other predators. Longevity did not differ significantly between sexes of C. carnea, and the sex ratio of newly eclosed adults did not differ from the previously reported sex ratio of 1♂: 1♀. Upon examination by light microscopy at the end of the trial, two C. carnea larvae were infected with N. adaliae and none were infected with T. hippodamiae, suggesting that T. hippodamiae influenced lacewing larval development without establishing an infection.",29410054,2018,"The influence of microsporidian pathogens from commercially available lady beetles on larval development of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, in the absence of infection."
185,"BACKGROUND
Cell surface mechanics is able to physically and biomechanically affect cell shape and motility, vesicle trafficking and actin dynamics. The biophysical properties of cell surface are strongly influenced by cytoskeletal elements. In mammals, tissue-specific expression of six actin isoforms is thought to confer differential biomechanical properties. However, the relative contribution of actin isoforms to cell surface properties is not well understood. Here, we sought to investigate whether and how the composition of endogenous actin isoforms directly affects the biomechanical features of cell surface and cellular behavior.


METHODS
We used fibroblasts isolated from wild type (WT), heterozygous (HET) and from knockout (KO) mouse embryos where both β-actin alleles are not functional. We applied a combination of genome-wide analysis and biophysical methods such as RNA-seq and atomic force microscopy.


RESULTS
We found that endogenous β-actin levels are essential in controlling cell surface stiffness and pull-off force, which was not compensated by the up-regulation of other actin isoforms. The variations of surface biophysical features and actin contents were associated with distinct cell behaviors in 2D and 3D WT, HET and KO cell cultures. Since β-actin in WT cells and smooth muscle α-actin up-regulated in KO cells showed different organization patterns, our data support the differential localization and organization as a mechanism to regulate the biophysical properties of cell surface by actin isoforms.


CONCLUSIONS
We propose that variations in actin isoforms composition impact on the biophysical features of cell surface and cause the changes in cell behavior.",29410074,2018,The relative composition of actin isoforms regulates cell surface biophysical features and cellular behaviors.
186,"Anxiety is one of the most common mental states of humans. Although it drives us to avoid frightening situations and to achieve our goals, it may also impose significant suffering and burden if it becomes extreme. Because we experience anxiety in a variety of forms, previous studies investigated neural substrates of anxiety in a variety of ways. These studies revealed that individuals with high state, trait, or pathological anxiety showed altered neural substrates. However, no studies have directly investigated whether the different dimensions of anxiety share a common neural substrate, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we investigated a brain network of anxiety shared by different dimensions of anxiety in a unified analytical framework using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed different datasets in a single scale, which was defined by an anxiety-related brain network derived from whole brain. We first conducted the anxiety provocation task with healthy participants who tended to feel anxiety related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in their daily life. We found a common state anxiety brain network across participants (1585 trials obtained from 10 participants). Then, using the resting-state fMRI in combination with the participants' behavioral trait anxiety scale scores (879 participants from the Human Connectome Project), we demonstrated that trait anxiety shared the same brain network as state anxiety. Furthermore, the brain network between common to state and trait anxiety could detect patients with OCD, which is characterized by pathological anxiety-driven behaviors (174 participants from multi-site datasets). Our findings provide direct evidence that different dimensions of anxiety have a substantial biological inter-relationship. Our results also provide a biologically defined dimension of anxiety, which may promote further investigation of various human characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, from the perspective of anxiety.",29410078,2018,"A common brain network among state, trait, and pathological anxiety from whole-brain functional connectivity."
187,"Cognitive control of attention in conflict situations is a basic skill that is vital for goal-oriented behavior. Behavioral evidence shows that conflict control occurs over successive trials as well as longer time scales of trial blocks, but the relation among time scales as well as their neural mechanisms are unclear. This study used measures of behavior, EEG, and a simple quantitative model to test the hypothesis that conflict control at the block level is not exclusively driven by control adjustments over successive trials. Young adults performed an auditory Simon task, and the base rate of compatible vs. incompatible trials was manipulated in separate blocks (25, 50, 75% compatible). EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to define cortical mechanisms of any base rate and trial-by-trial sequence effects. Reaction time measures had both sequence and base rate effects. Two fronto-medial ICA components indexed sequence and base rate effects, with specific profiles for evoked potentials and oscillations in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Predictive modeling showed that sequence effects accounted for a minority of the variance on behavioral and ICA measures (all < 36%). The results strongly suggest that the base rate manipulation affected behavior and many neural measures beyond the influence of sequence effects.",29410123,2018,Cognitive control and midline theta adjust across multiple timescales.

The behavior of the radius of gyration of the complexes as a function of the bound MTX concentration was used to quantitatively investigate the cooperativity of the condensation process.

189,"Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. However, how dopamine modulates the large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners, we investigated the effect of levodopa (l-dopa) on two aspects of cortical dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the functional connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in l-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, l-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. On the connectome level, however, l-dopa diminished functional integration across temporal and cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity in more than two thirds of the participants and to different degrees. Hypo-integration co-occurred with relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as posterior putamen. Both, l-dopa-induced BOLD signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individual's l-dopa-induced benefits in behavioral performance, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, l-dopa-induced modulations of BOLD signal variability were correlated with l-dopa-induced modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency. Our findings underline the role of dopamine in maintaining the dynamic range of, and communication between, cortical systems, and their explanatory power for inter-individual differences in benefits from dopamine during cognitive performance.",29410219,2018,Dopaminergic modulation of hemodynamic signal variability and the functional connectome during cognitive performance.
190,"The regulation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) behaviors has been mainly studied through exploration of biochemical factors. However, the current directed differentiation protocols for hPSCs that completely rely on biochemical factors remain suboptimal. It has recently become evident that coexisting biophysical signals in the stem cell microenvironment, including nanotopographic cues, can provide potent regulatory signals to mediate adult stem cell behaviors, including self-renewal and differentiation. Herein, we utilized a recently developed, large-scale nanofabrication technique based on reactive-ion etching (RIE) to generate random nanoscale structures on glass surfaces with high precision and reproducibility. We report here that hPSCs are sensitive to nanotopographic cues and such nanotopographic sensitivity can be leveraged for improving directed neuronal differentiation of hPSCs. We demonstrate early neuroepithelial conversion and motor neuron (MN) progenitor differentiation of hPSCs can be promoted using nanoengineered topographic substrates. We further explore how hPSCs sense the substrate nanotopography and relay this biophysical signal through a regulatory signaling network involving cell adhesion, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and Hippo/YAP signaling to mediate the neuroepithelial induction of hPSCs. Our study provides an efficient method for large-scale production of MNs from hPSCs, useful for regenerative medicine and cell-based therapies.",29410983,2018,Nanotopography regulates motor neuron differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.
191,"The tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA) is a recently identified structure that exerts a major inhibitory drive onto midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. Also referred to as the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), the tVTA is a cluster of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons that starts within the posterior end of the VTA, where it is restricted dorsolateral to the caudal part of the interpeduncular nucleus, and extends into the pons. First identified in the rat, the tVTA has been described in many species, including mice and monkeys, as a region exhibiting similar anatomical and behavioral properties; it receives strong excitatory inputs from the lateral habenula (LHb), conveys negative reward-related information, and inhibits midbrain DA neuron activity. As an important inhibitory afferent to midbrain DA neurons, the tVTA is also implicated in drug abuse and in the complex interplay between reward and aversion processes. The overarching goal of this review is to provide the current state of knowledge on the anatomy and connectivity of the tVTA and to discuss recent evidence implicating this structure in reward-related processes and in the effect of psychostimulants and drugs of abuse.",29421265,2018,The tail of the ventral tegmental area in behavioral processes and in the effect of psychostimulants and drugs of abuse.
192,"BACKGROUND
Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) show deficits in working memory (WM) performance accompanied by bilateral fronto-parietal BOLD signal changes. It is unclear whether patients with a first depressive episode (FDE) exhibit the same signal changes as patients with recurrent depressive episodes (RDE).


METHODS
We investigated seventy-four MDD inpatients (48 RDE, 26 FDE) and 74 healthy control (HC) subjects performing an n-back WM task (0-back, 2-back, 3-back condition) in a 3T-fMRI.


RESULTS
FMRI analyses revealed deviating BOLD signal in MDD in the thalamus (0-back vs. 2-back), the angular gyrus (0-back vs. 3-back), and the superior frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back). Further effects were observed between RDE vs. FDE. Thus, RDE displayed differing neural activation in the middle frontal gyrus (2-back vs. 3-back), the inferior frontal gyrus, and the precentral gyrus (0-back vs. 2-back). In addition, both HC and FDE indicated a linear activation trend depending on task complexity.


CONCLUSIONS
Although we failed to find behavioral differences between the groups, results suggest differing BOLD signal in fronto-parietal brain regions in MDD vs. HC, and in RDE vs. FDE. Moreover, both HC and FDE show similar trends in activation shapes. This indicates a link between levels of complexity-dependent activation in fronto-parietal brain regions and the stage of MDD. We therefore assume that load-dependent BOLD signal during WM is impaired in MDD, and that it is particularly affected in RDE. We also suspect neurobiological compensatory mechanisms of the reported brain regions in (working) memory functioning.",29421266,2018,Neural correlates of working memory in first episode and recurrent depression: An fMRI study.
193,"Proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H fMRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique capable of detecting dynamic changes in glutamate related to task-related demands at a temporal resolution under 1 min. Several recent 1H fMRS studies demonstrated elevated steady-state levels of glutamate of 2% or greater during different 'task-active' conditions, relative to a 'non-task-active' control condition. However, the 'control' condition from these studies does vary with respect to the degree of constraining behavior, which may lead to different glutamate levels or variability between 'control' conditions. The purpose of this 1H fMRS study was to compare the steady-state levels and variability of glutamate in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of 16 healthy adults across four different putative 'non-task-active' conditions: relaxed with eyes closed, passive visual fixation crosshair, visual flashing checkerboard, and finger tapping. Results showed significantly lower glutamate levels during the passive visual fixation crosshair than the visual flashing checkerboard and the finger tapping conditions. Moreover, glutamate was significantly less variable during the passive visual fixation crosshair and the visual flashing checkerboard than the relaxed eyes closed condition. Of the four conditions, the passive visual fixation crosshair condition demonstrated the lowest and least variable glutamate levels potentially reflecting the least dlPFC engagement, but greatest behavioral constraint. These results emphasize the importance of selecting a proper 'control' condition to reflect accurately a 'non-task-active' steady-state level of glutamate with minimal variability during 1H MRS investigations.",29421322,2018,Differences in steady-state glutamate levels and variability between 'non-task-active' conditions: Evidence from 1H fMRS of the prefrontal cortex.

Allostatic load was defined by 10 biomarkers indicating the cumulative physiologic burden of stress. Depressive disorder was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression examined whether current smoking, excessive/binge drinking, insufficient physical activitiy, and fair/poor diet modified relationships between allostatic load and depressive disorder.

195,"During extended observation of estrogen receptor (ER) α-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus, we previously identified a novel nucleus, the Sagittalis Nucleus of the Hypothalamus (SGN), in the interstitial area between the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The SGN exhibits sexual dimorphism in its volume and cell count, and estrous cycle related variations in ERα-immunoreactivity. These characteristics of the SGN implicate the nucleus in sex-biased brain functions and behaviors. In this study, we examined involvement of the SGN in sexual arousal in female rats. Immunohistochemical staining of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity was performed after administration of an estrus-inducing dose of estrogen and progesterone in ovariectomized female rats. Analysis of microscopic images showed a significant increase in the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the SGN following hormonal manipulation. Moreover, neuronal activity in the region exhibited a further increase after each animal was coupled with a male and allowed to mate.

196,"BACKGROUND
Crack-cocaine is an important public health problem in Brazil and worldwide. It is a potent form of cocaine which results in rapid and damaging stimulating effects on the central nervous system through inhibition of the dopamine transporter. Some studies have suggested that both food and drugs - including crack, can act on the same brain reward mechanisms, altering the dopamine pathways that modulate behavioral responses. Our hypothesis was that leptin, a well-known peptide that modulates energy metabolism and appetite, can be used as a biomarker for drug use.


METHODS
Anthropometric data, drug use profiles, and leptin serum levels were evaluated in a cross-sectional study of 40 crack-cocaine users.


RESULTS
Leptin showed an inverse correlation with the severity of crack use, and this correlation remained when corrected by body mass index (BMI) and body composition by bioimpedance (BIA). The majority of subjects were eutrophic or overweight/obese considering BMI and BIA, and these variables were not significantly associated with the severity of crack use, but positively correlated with leptin levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Our preliminary findings suggest that leptin could be involved in drug use severity, perhaps through pathways similar to those whereby it modulates food intake. Considering the anthropometric parameters, these findings provide additional evidence that low weight is not predominant in crack users.",29421542,2018,Leptin levels and its correlation with crack-cocaine use severity: A preliminary study.
197,"Intracortical microelectrode arrays, especially the Utah array, remain the most common choice for obtaining high dimensional recordings of spiking neural activity for brain computer interface and basic neuroscience research. Despite the widespread use and established design, mechanical, material and biological challenges persist that contribute to a steady decline in recording performance (as evidenced by both diminished signal amplitude and recorded cell population over time) or outright array failure. Device implantation injury causes acute cell death and activation of inflammatory microglia and astrocytes that leads to a chronic neurodegeneration and inflammatory glial aggregation around the electrode shanks and often times fibrous tissue growth above the pia along the bed of the array within the meninges. This multifaceted deleterious cascade can result in substantial variability in performance even under the same experimental conditions. We track both impedance signatures and electrophysiological performance of 4 × 4 floating microelectrode Utah arrays implanted in the primary monocular visual cortex (V1m) of Long-Evans rats over a 12-week period. We employ a repeatable visual stimulation method to compare signal-to-noise ratio as well as single- and multi-unit yield from weekly recordings. To explain signal variability with biological response, we compare arrays categorized as either Type 1, partial fibrous encapsulation, or Type 2, complete fibrous encapsulation and demonstrate performance and impedance signatures unique to encapsulation type.

We hypothesize that this behavior is directly targeted to accelerate embryo development time given that deep-sea skates have some of the longest egg incubation times reported for the animal kingdom.

199,"The large amount of nanoscale pores in shale results in the inability to apply Darcy's law. Moreover, the gas adsorption of shale increases the complexity of pore size characterization and thus decreases the accuracy of flow regime estimation. In this study, an apparent permeability model, which describes the adsorptive gas flow behavior in shale by considering the effects of gas adsorption, stress dependence, and non-Darcy flow, is proposed. The pore size distribution, methane adsorption capacity, pore compressibility, and matrix permeability of the Barnett and Eagle Ford shales are measured in the laboratory to determine the critical parameters of gas transport phenomena. The slip coefficients, tortuosity, and surface diffusivity are predicted via the regression analysis of the permeability data. The results indicate that the apparent permeability model, which considers second-order gas slippage, Knudsen diffusion, and surface diffusion, could describe the gas flow behavior in the transition flow regime for nanoporous shale. Second-order gas slippage and surface diffusion play key roles in the gas flow in nanopores for Knudsen numbers ranging from 0.18 to 0.5. Therefore, the gas adsorption and non-Darcy flow effects, which involve gas slippage, Knudsen diffusion, and surface diffusion, are indispensable parameters of the permeability model for shale.",29422663,2018,Multiparameter Analysis of Gas Transport Phenomena in Shale Gas Reservoirs: Apparent Permeability Characterization.

201,"The extent to which N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors facilitate the motivation to voluntarily wheel-run in rodents has yet to be determined. In so, we utilized female Wistar rats selectively bred to voluntarily run high (HVR) and low (LVR) nightly distances in order to examine if endogenous differences in nucleus accumbens (NAc) NMDA receptor expression and function underlies the propensity for high or low motivation to voluntarily wheel-run. 12-14 week old HVR and LVR females were used to examine: 1.) NAc mRNA and protein expression of NMDA subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B; 2.) NMDA current responses in isolated medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and 3.) NMDA-evoked dopamine release in an ex vivo preparation of NAc punches. Expectedly, there was a large divergence in nightly running distance and time between HVR and LVR rats. We saw a significantly higher mRNA and protein expression of NR1 in HVR compared to LVR rats, while seeing no difference in the expression of NR2A or NR2B. There was a greater current response to a 500 ms application of 300 μM of NMDA in medium-spiny neurons isolated from the NAc HVR compared to LVR animals. On average, NMDA-evoked punches (50 μM of NMDA for 10 min) taken from HVR rats retained ∼54% of the dopamine content compared to their bilateral non-evoked sides, while evoked punches from LVR animals showed no statistical decrease in dopamine content compared to their non-evoked sides. Collectively, these data suggest a potential link between NAc NR1 subunit expression as well as NMDA function and the predisposition for nightly voluntary running behavior in rats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Sham, TBI control, 1X DCXF (520.6 mg/kg) and 5X DCXF (2603.0 mg/kg). Two treatment groups (1X and 5X DCXF) were intragastrically administered daily for 7 days before CCI-induced TBI and then DCXF treatments were continued post-TBI until the animal behavioral tests, including Morris water maze test, acceleration rotarod motor test and CatWalk quantitative gait analysis test, were done. The brain water content and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured by wet-dry weight method and Evans blue method, respectively. The number of neuron cells, neural stem cells (NSCs), GFAP positive cells (astrocyte) as well as Iba-1 positive cells (microglia) were determined by histology and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Treatment with DCXF significantly improved the learning ability and memory retention in Morris water maze test, and remarkably enhanced motor performances in acceleration rotarod motor test and catwalk quantitative gait analysis test after TBI. Moreover, DCXF treatment was able to reduce BBB permeability, brain edema, microglia and astrocyte activation, improve the proliferation of NSCs and decrease neurons loss in the brain with TBI.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study demonstrated that DCXF treatment could decrease BBB leakage and brain edema, reduce neuron loss, microglia and astrocyte activation, and increase NSCs proliferation, which may contribute to the cognitive and motor protection of DCXF in the TBI rats. It is the first time to provide potentially underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect of DCXF on TBI-induced brain damage and functional outcomes.",29425850,2018,Neuroprotective effect of Da Chuanxiong Formula against cognitive and motor deficits in a rat controlled cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury.
203,"Sol-gel transition behavior of agarose aqueous solution was investigated by using rheology and fluorescence measurement. On heating, the storage modulus G' decreased gradually, then deviated abruptly at the temperature of about 65°C, and finally decreased slowly again. For fluorescence measurement, the phase transition point kept almost at the temperature of 65°C, which was consistent with that in rheology measurement. Upon compression, it was indicated that the fluorescence lifetime for the probe in the agarose aqueous solution showed a dramatic change in the vicinity of the phase transition point. T vs. P phase diagram of agarose aqueous solution was constructed, which showed that the melting point was an increasing function of pressure. Based on the phase diagram, the agarose gels were prepared by cooling under atmospheric pressure and the pressure of 300MPa, respectively. From the result of the recovered samples studied by optical rheometry, it was found that agarose gel prepared under high pressure had a higher elasticity and lower viscosity index, compared with that under atmospheric pressure. It could be speculated that such kinds of properties might be attributed to the smaller pore size during gelation under high pressure.",29425863,2018,In situ observation of sol-gel transition of agarose aqueous solution by fluorescence measurement.
204,"Disrupted sociability and consequent social withdrawal are (early) symptoms of a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, depressive disorders and Alzheimer's disease. The paucity of objective measures to translationally assess social withdrawal characteristics has been an important limitation to study this behavioral phenotype, both in human and rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate sociability and social withdrawal in rodents using an ethologically valid behavioral paradigm, the Visible Burrow System (VBS). The VBS mimics a natural environment, with male and female rodents housed together in an enclosure where a large open arena is connected to a continuously dark burrow system that includes 4 nest boxes. In this study, mixed-sex colonies of C57BL/6J and of BTBR mice have been investigated (n = 8 mice per colony). Results showed marked differences between the two strains, in terms of sociability as well as social withdrawal behaviors. In particular, BTBR mice performed less social behaviors and have a preference for non-social behaviors compared to C57BL/6J mice. Neurobiologically, the decreased sociability of BTBR was accompanied by reduced GABA and increased glutamate concentrations in brain prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala regions. In conclusion, our study validated the use of the VBS as an ethologically relevant behavioral paradigm in group-housed mice to investigate individual sociability and social withdrawal features and their underlying neurobiology. This paradigm may provide new insights to develop new therapeutic treatments for behavioral dysfunctions that may be relevant across neuropsychiatric diseases.",29425919,2018,The Visible Burrow System: A behavioral paradigm to assess sociability and social withdrawal in BTBR and C57BL/6J mice strains.
205,"BACKGROUND
Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P. gingivalis-LPS) is one of the major pathogenic factors of chronic periodontitis (CP). Few reports on the correlation between P. gingivalis-LPS and cognitive function exist. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of P. gingivalis-LPS on cognitive function and the associated underlying mechanism in C57BL/6 mice.


METHODS
The C57BL/6 mice were injected with P. gingivalis-LPS (5 mg kg-1) either with or without Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor (TAK-242, 5 mg kg-1). After 7 days, behavioral alterations were assessed with the open field test (OFT), Morris water maze (MWM) test, and passive avoidance test (PAT). The activation of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice was observed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4), and CD14 and the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (IRAK1, p65, and p-p65) in the cerebral cortex of the mice were evaluated by RT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot.


RESULTS
The OFT showed that P. gingivalis-LPS did not affect the initiative and activity of mice. Administration of P. gingivalis-LPS significantly impaired spatial learning and memory during the MWM test and attenuated the ability of passive avoidance learning during the PAT. Both astrocytes and microglia were activated in the cortex and hippocampus. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) was upregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS in the cortex. In addition, the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated (TLR4, CD14, IRAK1, and p-p65). These effects were effectively alleviated by TAK-242.


CONCLUSIONS
Administration of P. gingivalis-LPS can lead to learning and memory impairment in C57BL/6 mice. This impairment is mediated by activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway. Our study suggests that P. gingivalis-LPS-induced neuroinflammation plays an important role in cognitive impairment. It also reveals that endotoxins of periodontal pathogens could represent a risk factor for cognitive disorders.",29426327,2018,"Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces cognitive dysfunction, mediated by neuronal inflammation via activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in C57BL/6 mice."
206,"Calcineurin is required for long-term depression and activity-dependent spine shrinkage, and calcineurin mutations have been identified in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, mice with conditional knockout of calcineurin B (CNB-KO) exhibit behavioral abnormalities suggestive of schizophrenia. Changes in the dendritic spines of these mice, however, have not been investigated. We therefore examined the dendritic spines of CNB-KO mice, and observed a significant reduction in small spines and an increase in large spines in the prefrontal and visual cortices. The effect of CNB-KO on the spine sizes was relatively moderate, possibly due to the presence of spontaneous fluctuations (dynamics) in the dendritic spines themselves. Thus, CNB-KO mice showed a spine phenotype similar to those recently reported in patients with schizophrenia.",29427598,2018,Calcineurin knockout mice show a selective loss of small spines.
207,"Thiamine/vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in humans. This may due in part to vascular damage, neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration in the diencephalon, which is seen in animal models of pyrithiamine-enhanced thiamine deficiency. However, the time course of the progression of these changes in the animal models has been poorly characterized. Therefore, in this study, the progression of: 1) activated microglial association with vasculature; 2) neurodegeneration; and 3) any vascular leakage in the forebrain during the progress of thiamine deficiency were determined. A thiamine deficient diet along with 0.25 mg/kg/d of pyrithiamine was used as the mouse model. Vasculature was identified with Cd31 and microglia with Cd11b and Iba1 immunoreactivity. Neurodegeneration was determined by FJc labeling. The first sign of activated microglia within the thalamic nuclei were detected after 8 d of thiamine deficiency, and by 9 d activated microglia associated primarily with vasculature were clearly present but only in thalamus. At the 8 d time point neurodegeneration was not present in thalamus. However at 9 d, the first signs of neurodegeneration (FJc + neurons) were seen in most animals. Over 80% of the microglia were activated at 10 d but almost exclusively in the thalamus and the number of degenerating neurons was less than 10% of the activated microglia. At 10 d, there were sporadic minor changes in IgG presence in thalamus indicating minor vascular leakage. Dizocilpine (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) or phenobarbital (10-20 mg/kg) was administered to groups of mice from day 8 through day 10 to block neurodegeneration but neither did. In summary, activated microglia start to surround vasculature 1-2 d prior to the start of neurodegeneration. This response may be a means of controlling or repairing vascular damage and leakage. Glutamate excitotoxicity and vascular leakage likely only play a minor role in the early neurodegeneration resulting from thiamine deficiency. However, failure of dysfunctional vasculature endothelium to supply sufficient nutrients to neurons could be contributing to the neurodegeneration.",29427613,2018,Microglial activation and vascular responses that are associated with early thalamic neurodegeneration resulting from thiamine deficiency.
208,"BACKGROUND
Watching television is a common pastime for very young children. High exposure may negatively influence physical and mental health outcomes. Not much is known about how early exposure relates to lifestyle choices in adolescence.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate how toddler televiewing is subsequently associated with lifestyle indicators at adolescence.


METHODS
Participants are 986 girls and 999 boys from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development birth cohort (Canada). Child self-reports lifestyle habits at age 13 that were linearly regressed on parent-reported televiewing at age 2 while adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Every 1 h 13 m increase in daily televiewing was prospectively associated with a 8.2% increased risk of unhealthy eating habits (unstandardized b = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07), 10.1% decrease in eating breakfast on weekdays (unstandardized b = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.09 to -0.04), 13.3% increase in BMI (unstandardized b = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.50), 4.7% decrease in student engagement (unstandardized b = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.004), and 5.8% increase in concurrent screen time (unstandardized b = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.11). Post hoc simulations of noncompliance with AAP recommendations support their implementation.


CONCLUSIONS
Excessive toddlerhood televiewing was prospectively associated with less optimal health and self-invested behavioral dispositions. Lifestyle habits not only affect metabolic risk but may also influence personal success outcomes. These independent relationships, observed more than a decade later, suggest a need for better parental awareness of the way children invest their limited waking hours could affect their long-term life course trajectories.",29427671,2018,Prospective associations between toddler televiewing and subsequent lifestyle habits in adolescence.
209,"Few rigorous longitudinal assessments have examined health-related quality of life (HRQoL) changes after smoking cessation, especially among recently-hospitalized smokers. We compared the change in HRQoL between those who did or did not quit smoking 6 months after hospital discharge. Participants were 1357 smokers recruited for a cessation trial between 2012 and 2014 while hospitalized at two hospitals in Massachusetts and one in Pennsylvania. Cessation was defined as biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months or as self-reported continuous abstinence at 1, 3, or 6 months post discharge. HRQoL measures included a single-item global health measure (SF1); the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) screening tool for psychological distress; and the EQ-5D-5L health utilities measure. Multivariable models controlled for age, sex, race, education, insurance, study site, study arm, discharge diagnoses, and baseline HRQoL. Improvements in HRQoL were evident in the first month after discharge among those achieving abstinence compared to continuing smokers. At 6 months post-discharge, those with biochemically confirmed cessation were 30% more likely to report at least good health by the SF1 (aRR 95% CI 1.14-1.45), 19% less likely to screen positive for psychological distress (aRR, 95% CI 0.68-0.93), and had EQ-5D-5L health utility scores 0.05 points (95% CI 0.02-0.08) higher than continuing smokers. Results were similar when assessed as a function of self-reported cessation. Hospital-initiated smoking cessation is associated with rapid statistically and clinically significant improvements in a range of HRQoL measures, providing an additional tool clinicians and health systems could use to encourage smoking cessation.",29427673,2018,Improvements in health-related quality of life among smokers who quit after hospitalization.
210,"Obesity is a public health problem that disproportionately affects low-income populations. Moreover, participation in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been associated with obesity among low-income women. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors on diet quality and body mass index (BMI) of low-income women participating in SNAP. This study also aimed to examine the role of these factors in mediating the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality, and BMI. A total of 152 women receiving SNAP benefits were recruited from low-income neighborhood centers and housing communities, and administered a demographics questionnaire, the United States adult food security scale, food frequency questionnaire, and multi-dimensional home environment scale (MHES). They also were measured for height and weight to calculate BMI. The Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index 2015 was used to measure diet quality. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the MHES subscales that were significant predictors of diet quality and BMI. The Preacher and Hayes mediation model was used to evaluate the mediation of the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality, and BMI by the MHES. Emotional eating resistance and favorable social eating behaviors were positively associated with diet quality; whereas emotional eating resistance, lower availability of unhealthy food at home, neighborhood safety and favorable social eating behaviors were inversely associated with BMI in women participating in SNAP. The MHES significantly mediated the relationship between food insecurity and BMI. These results emphasize the importance of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors in mediating the relationship between food insecurity and BMI in low-income women.",29427689,2018,"Food insecurity, diet quality and body mass index of women participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: The role of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors."
211,"Hyperphosphorylation of tau is one of the main hallmarks for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other tauopathies. Norepinephrine (NE), a stress-related hormone and 17-β-estradiol (E2) thought to influence tau phosphorylation (p-tau) and AD pathology. The controversy around the impact of NE and E2 requires further clarification. Moreover, the combination effect of physiological and psychological stress and estrogen alteration during menopause, which affect p-tau, has not been addressed. Exposure to E2 is believed to reduce NE release, however, the link between these two hormones and AD at cellular level was also remained unknown. Here, we examined whether NE and E2 treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells affected tau phosphorylation. The involvement of adenosine monophosphate kinase protein kinase (AMPK) and target of Rapamycin (mTOR) as the possible mechanisms, underlying this effect was also investigated. Subsequent to SH-SY5Y differentiation to mature neurons, we treated the cells with NE, E2 and NE plus E2 in presence and absence of Compound C and Rapamycin. Cell viability was not affected by our treatment while our Western blot and immunofluorescent findings showed that exposure to NE and E2 separately, and in combination enhanced p-tau (Ser396) and (Ser262)/tau but not (Ser202/Thr205)/tau. Blocking AMPK by Compound C reduced p-tau (Ser396) and (Ser262), while GSK-3β and PP2A activities were remained unchanged. We also found that blocking mTOR by Rapamycin did not change increased p-tau (Ser396) and (Ser262) due to NE + E2 treatment. Collectively, our results suggested that tau hyperphosphorylation due to exposure to NE/E2 was mediated by AMPK, the main energy regulator of cells during stress with no significant involvement of mTOR, GSK-3β and PP2A.",29427776,2018,Beta estradiol and norepinephrine treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells enhances tau phosphorylation at (Ser396) and (Ser262) via AMPK but not mTOR signaling pathway.
212,"AIMS
We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time.


METHODS
The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age.


RESULTS
Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.


CONCLUSIONS
Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.",29428324,2018,"Pre- and postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure and child behavior problems: Bidirectional associations, joint effects, and sex differences."
213,"Individuals with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) experience episodic memory deficits that may be progressive in nature. These memory decrements have been shown to increase with the extent of hippocampal damage, a hallmark feature of TLE. Pattern separation, a neural computational mechanism thought to play a role in episodic memory formation, has been shown to be negatively affected by aging and in individuals with known hippocampal dysfunction. Despite the link between poor pattern separation performance and episodic memory deficits, behavioral pattern separation has not been examined in patients with TLE. We examined pattern separation performance in a group of 22 patients with medically-refractory TLE and 20 healthy adults, using a task hypothesized to measure spatial pattern separation with graded levels of spatial interference. We found that individuals with TLE showed less efficient spatial pattern separation performance relative to healthy adults. Poorer spatial pattern separation performance in TLE was associated with poorer visuospatial memory, but only under high interference conditions. In addition, left hippocampal atrophy was associated with poor performance in the high interference condition in TLE. These data suggest that episodic memory impairments in patients with chronic, refractory TLE may be partially due to less efficient pattern separation, which likely reflects their underlying hippocampal dysfunction.",29428769,2018,Impaired spatial pattern separation performance in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with visuospatial memory deficits and hippocampal volume loss.
214,"The purpose of this research was to explore the behavior of aquaporins (AQPs) in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease that is a recurrent neurodegenerative disorder caused by the gradual, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Because of postmortem studies have provided evidences for oxidative damage and alteration of water flow and energy metabolism, we carried out an investigation about AQP4 and 9, demonstrated in the brain to maintain water and energy homeostasis. As an appropriate in vitro cell model, we used SH-SY5Y cultures and induced their differentiation into a mature dopaminergic neuron phenotype with retinoic acid (RA) alone or in association with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (MPA). The association RA plus MPA provided the most complete and mature neuron phenotype, as demonstrated by high levels of β-Tubulin III, MAP-2, and tyrosine hydroxylase. After validation of cell differentiation, the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and H2O2 were applied to reproduce a Parkinson's-like stress. The results confirmed RA/MPA differentiated SH-SY5Y as a useful in vitro system for studying neurotoxicity and for using in a MPTP and H2O2-induced Parkinson's disease cell model. Moreover, the data demonstrated that neuronal differentiation, neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress are strongly correlated with dynamic changes of AQP4 and 9 transcription and transduction. New in vitro and in vivo experiments are needed to confirm these innovative outcomes.",29428877,2018,New insights on Parkinson's disease from differentiation of SH-SY5Y into dopaminergic neurons: An involvement of aquaporin4 and 9.
215,"Repeated exposure to childhood adversity (abuse, neglect and other traumas experienced before age 18) can have lifelong impacts on health. For HIV-infected adolescents and youth, such impacts may include onward transmission of HIV. To evaluate this possibility, the current study measured the burden of childhood adversity and its influence on risky health behaviors among perinatally-infected adolescents and youth. We surveyed 250 perinatally-infected adolescents and youth (13-24 years) receiving care in Soweto, South Africa. Both male and female participants reported on childhood adversity (using the ACE-IQ), sexual behavior, and psychosocial state. Viral load was also abstracted from their charts. We used logistic regressions to test the association between cumulative adversity and behavioral outcomes. Half the sample reported eight or more adversities. Overall, 72% experienced emotional abuse, 59% experienced physical abuse, 34% experienced sexual abuse, 82% witnessed domestic violence, and 91% saw someone being attacked in their community. A clear gradient emerged between cumulative adversities and behavioral risk. Having experienced one additional childhood adversity raised the odds of risky sexual behavior by almost 30% (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.48). Viral suppression was poor overall (31% had viral loads >400 copies/ml), but was not related to adversity. Adversity showed a robust relationship to depression and substance abuse. Childhood adversity is common, influences the current health of HIV-positive adolescents and youth, and puts their sexual partners at risk for HIV infection. Greater primary prevention of childhood adversity and increased access to support services (e.g., mental health) could reduce risk taking among HIV-positive adolescents and youth.",29428881,2018,Childhood adversity increases the risk of onward transmission from perinatal HIV-infected adolescents and youth in South Africa.

The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) has been used as a screening tool for RBD. We investigated the clinical characteristics of probable RBD (pRBD) using the RBDSQ in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).


Methods
Seventy patients with PD (age: 69.2 ± 8.9 years old, 31 males and 49 females, length of PD morbidity: 7.4 ± 6.4 years, Hoehn and Yahr: 2.7 ± 0.8) underwent examination including the RBDSQ and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in both 2011 and 2013. We assessed the changes and characteristics of pRBD associated with PD during the two year interval.


Results
Nineteen patients (27.1%) in 2011 and 27 patients (38.6%) in 2013 were diagnosed as having pRBD because they scored 6 or higher on the RBDSQ. During the 2 year interval, twelve patients showed persistent pRBD, 15 developed pRBD, and 7 showed improved pRBD. In 2013, PD patients with pRBD took higher amounts of levodopa equivalents and scored lower on the MMSE than those without pRBD. Also, more PD patients with pRBD had dementia than those without pRBD. Similarly, more patients with persistent and developed pRBD had dementia than those without.

219,"Background
The physicians often confuse the early symptoms of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with Alzheimer dementia (AD), leading to misdiagnosis. There are some cognitive tests to discriminate between AD and behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), and the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) is a promising test for this purpose.


Objective
To assess the performance of the IFS to differentiate patients with AD from patients with bvFTD, compared with the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB).


Methods
A prospective study with 117 patients of our cognitive unit (35 case-patients with AD, 34 case-patients with bvFTD, and 48 control subjects). They were submitted to the following successive phases of evaluation: 1) screening; 2) dementia diagnosis; and 3) dementia sub-type diagnosis. The IFS and FAB were blind and independently applied by one neurologist to all the participants to end of phase 1 (screening), before to the definitive diagnosis establishment.


Results
bvFTD showed a lower performance than AD patients on the IFS total score (F(1, 66) = 70.10, p < 0.01) and FAB total score (F(1, 66) = 17.91, p < 0.01). The IFS and FAB showed a sensitivity of 94.12% (95%CI = 80.3-99.2) and 82.3% (95%CI = 65.4-93.2), and a specificity of 94.2% (95%CI = 80.8-99.3) and 48.5% (95%CI = 31.3, 66.1), respectively.

220,"INTRODUCTION
The study examined the association of neighborhood walkability to multiple activity-related outcomes and BMI among adolescents and evaluated socioeconomic status as an effect modifier.


METHOD
Cross-sectional study, with adolescents recruited from neighborhoods that met criteria for a 2 × 2 matrix defined by high/low GIS-defined walkability and high/low median income. Adolescents aged 12-16 years (n = 928) were recruited from selected neighborhoods in Maryland and King County, Washington regions in 2009-2011. There were 50.4% girls, and 66.3% were non-Hispanic white, with no medical restrictions on physical activity (PA) or diets. Total PA and sedentary time was assessed by 7 days of accelerometer monitoring. Adolescents self-reported active transport, time spent on 6 sedentary behaviors, and height and weight, used to compute BMI percentiles. Mixed model linear and logistic regressions examined outcomes for association with walkability and income, adjusting for demographic covariates and clustering within block groups.


RESULTS
Walkability was positively and significantly related to objectively-measured PA (p < .001) and more frequent walking for transportation (p < .001). Total self-reported sedentary time (p = .048) and TV time (p < .007) were negatively related to walkability. Time in vehicles was negatively related to walkability only among higher-income adolescents.


CONCLUSIONS
Neighborhood walkability was strongly and consistently associated with adolescents' objectively-assessed total physical activity and reported active transportation. A novel finding was that adolescents living in walkable neighborhoods reported less television time and less time in vehicles. Most results were similar across income categories. Results strengthen the rationale for recommendations to improve walkability.",29432790,2018,"Neighborhood built environment and socioeconomic status in relation to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight status of adolescents."
221,"The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is increasing despite insufficient information concerning their long-term effects, including the effects of maternal e-cigarette use on pre- and postnatal development. Our previous study demonstrated that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol (a principal component of e-cigarette liquid) affected early development of zebrafish, causing reduced growth, deformities, and hyperactive swimming behavior in larvae. The current study extends assessment of the developmental toxicity of 1,2-propanediol by examining additional long-term behavioral effects. We demonstrate that embryonic/larval exposure of zebrafish to 1,2-propanediol (0.625% or 1.25%) not only affected behavioral parameters in the larvae, but also caused persisting behavioral effects in adults after early developmental exposure. Additional parameters, including neural and vascular development in larvae, stress response in adults, and concentration of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in adult brain were examined, in order to explain the behavioral differences. These additional assessments did not find 1,2-propanediol exposure to significantly affect Tg(Neurog1:GFP) or the transcript abundance of neural genes (Neurog1, Ascl1a, Elavl3, and Lef1). Vascular development was not found to be affected by 1,2-propanediol exposure, as inferred from experiments with Tg(Flk1:eGFP) zebrafish; however, transcript abundance of vascular genes (Flk1, Vegf, Tie-2, and Angpt1) was decreased. No statistically significant changes were noted for plasma cortisol or brain neurotransmitters in adult fish. Lastly, analysis of gene transcripts involved with 1,2-propanediol metabolism (Adh5, Aldh2.1, and Ldha) showed an increase in Adh5 transcript. This is the first study to demonstrate that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol has long-term neurobehavioral consequences in adult zebrafish, showing that e-cigarettes contain substances potentially harmful to neurodevelopment.",29432853,2018,"Neurobehavioral effects of 1,2-propanediol in zebrafish (Danio rerio)."
222,"The peptide apelin and its receptor APJ are found to express in multiple brain regions, especially in the regions such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus that play important roles in stress and depression. The distribution of apelin and APJ suggests that the apelinergic signaling may be a key mediator in the development of stress-related depressive behavior. We recently demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of apelin-13 exerts an antidepressant-like activity in the rat forced swimming test (FST). However, the possible brain region mediating apelin-13's antidepressant-like activity remains unclear. In the present study, we determined whether the hippocampus and hypothalamus are the possible regions mediating antidepressant-like activity of apelin-13. We found that forced swimming exposure upregulated apelin and APJ protein expression levels in the hippocampus but not hypothalamus in rats. Further, intrahippocampal injection of apelin-13 exerted an antidepressant-like activity (as indicated by a decreased immobility behavior), and intrahippocampal infusion of APJ receptor antagonist F13A blocked the antidepressant-like activity produced by i.c.v injection of apelin-13 in the FST. Moreover, intrahypothalamic injection of apelin-13 did not affect the immobility behavior in the FST. These findings suggest that the hippocampus, but not hypothalamus, is a critical site mediating antidepressant-like activity of apelin-13 in rats.",29432881,2018,The Hippocampus is a Critical Site Mediating Antidepressant-like Activity of Apelin-13 in Rats.
223,"Although regular physical activity is known to benefit health of aging populations, there are still many factors, which regulate exercise-induced adaptive changes. Among many vitamin D and myokines are under consideration. We, therefore, evaluated the influence of a single session of and regular Nordic Walking (NW) training combined with vitamin D supplementation on cognitive functions and muscle strength and some elements of the amino-acid profile. Thirty-five healthy elderly women (68 ± 5 years old) from health promotion programmes took part in the study. At baseline they were divided into two groups: women, who participated in NW training for the first time (Beginners Group: BG) and women, who continued regular NW training longer than four years (Advance Group: AG). All women had a similar concentration of vitamin D (above 20 ng·ml-1) at baseline. The 12 weeks of NW training was supported by supplementation of vitamin D3 (4000 IU/day). Muscle strength, serum concentrations of myokines (irisin and IL-6), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammation marker, glucose, branched amino acids and tryptophan were all assessed at baseline, 1 h after the first single training session and adequately at the end of the training programme. In addition, iron and ferritin were measured. The concentration of vitamin D3 as well as psychological (Quality-of-Life Assessment, The Beck Depression Inventory-2) and cognitive evaluations (D2 test of attention, Trial Making Test A&B) were also performed before and after the 12-week training programme. Data were interpreted using magnitude-based inferences. According to data obtained in this study, regular NW training resulted in improvement of cognitive functions in aged women. These positive changes were accompanied by an increase of irisin and BDNF concentration (adjusted effect moderate and likely). Our data also revealed that observed reductions of glucose and tryptophan concentrations might have positively contributed to the amelioration of cognitive functions. Still, obtained results indicated that it was not the level vitamin D that modulated exercise-induced changes, but rather the long-lasting experience and being more advanced in training.",29432893,2018,Improvement of cognitive functions in response to a regular Nordic walking training in elderly women - A change dependent on the training experience.
224,"BACKGROUND
Frailty has been recognized as an important medical syndrome in older adults. Growing literature supports the clinical application of frailty but US older adults' perceptions of frailty have not been explored. We aim to examine perceptions and informational needs about frailty among older adults.


METHODS
This was a qualitative study involving focus groups of community-dwelling older adults with diverse age and frailty status. We explored participants' beliefs and knowledge about frailty and informational needs about frailty as a medical syndrome.


RESULTS
The participants' mean age was 76.3. Of the 29 participants, 21 (72%) were female, and 21 (72%) were white. We identified three major themes: 1) Older adults' perceptions of frailty differed from the definition used in medical literature; they often perceived a psychological component to being frailty and some were skeptical of the syndromic definition based on multiple symptoms. 2) Compared to participants who were non-frail or pre-frail, participants who were frail were more receptive to discussing their frailty status with clinicians; 3) Participants wanted know about how to treat or prevent frailty and the risks associated with being frail. Many participants felt that these information can be conveyed without necessarily using the specific term ""frail"", which they perceived to have a negative connotation.


CONCLUSIONS
Older adults, especially those who are frail, may be interested to discuss frailty as a medical syndrome. However, negative perceptions are associated with the term ""frail"" and may be a barrier to clinical application of frailty. Further research is needed to understand acceptable ways for communicating about frailty in clinical practice.",29433426,2018,Older adults' perceptions and informational needs regarding frailty.

The pattern of alcohol consumption in Ireland has serious societal and health consequences. General practice is well placed to screen for problem alcohol use and to carry out brief interventions. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of documentation of problem alcohol use in patient records in Irish general practice, and to describe the documentation of its diagnosis and treatment.


METHODS
General practitioners (GPs) affiliated with an Irish medical school were invited to participate in the study. One hundred patients were randomly selected from each participating practice using the practice software and the clinical records were reviewed for evidence of problem alcohol use. The following was recorded: patient demographics, whether problem alcohol use was documented, whether they had an intervention, a psychotropic medication or if a referral was made. Descriptive statistics and an estimate of the prevalence were calculated using SPSS and SAS software.


RESULTS
Seventy one percent of the practices participated (n = 40), generating a sample of 3, 845 active patients. Only 57 patients (1.5%, 95% confidence interval 1 to 2%) were identified as having problem alcohol use in the previous two years. 29 (51%) of those with documented problem alcohol use were referred to other specialist services. 28 (49%) received a psychological intervention. 40 (70%) were prescribed psychotropic medications.


CONCLUSION
This is the first large scale study of patient records in general practice in Ireland looking at documentation of screening and treatment of problem alcohol use. It highlights the current lack of documentation of alcohol problems and the need to re-inforce positive attitudes among GPs in relation to preventive work.",29433442,2018,Is problem alcohol use being detected and treated in Irish general practice?
226,"BACKGROUND
Species recognition, i.e., the ability to distinguish conspecifics from heterospecifics, plays an essential role in reproduction. The role of facial cues for species recognition has been investigated in several non-human primate species except for lemurs. We therefore investigated the role of facial cues for species recognition in wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) at Kirindy Forest. We presented adult red-fronted lemurs pictures of male faces from five species including red-fronted lemurs, three closely related species, white-fronted lemurs (E. albifrons), brown lemurs (E. fulvus), rufous brown lemurs (E. rufus), and genetically more distant red-bellied lemurs (E. rubriventer), occurring in allopatry with the study population. We predicted that red-fronted lemurs respond stronger to conspecific than to heterospecific pictures and that females show stronger responses than males. In addition, if genetic drift has played a role in the evolution of facial color patterns in the members of this genus, we predicted that responses of red-fronted lemurs correlate negatively with the genetic distance to the different species stimuli.


RESULTS
Red-fronted lemurs looked significantly longer at pictures of their own species than at those of heterospecifics. Females spent less time looking at pictures of white-fronted, brown and red-bellied lemurs than males did, but not to pictures of red-bellied lemurs and a control stimulus. Individuals also exhibited sniffing behavior while looking at visual stimuli, and the time spent sniffing was significantly longer for pictures of conspecifics compared to those of heterospecifics. Moreover, the time spent looking and sniffing towards the pictures correlated negatively with the genetic distance between their own species and the species presented as stimulus.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that red-fronted lemurs have the ability for species recognition using visual facial cues, which may allow them to avoid costly interbreeding. If so, sexual selection might have influenced the evolution of facial patterns in eulemurs. Since responses also correlated with genetic distance, our findings suggest a potential role of genetic drift as well as sexual selection in influencing the evolution of facial variation in eulemurs. Because study subjects looked and sniffed towards the presented pictures, red-fronted lemurs might have the ability for multi-modal species recognition.",29433448,2018,The role of facial pattern variation for species recognition in red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons).

Despite the significant impact of migraine on patients and societies, few studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have investigated the association between migraine and suicidal behavior. The objective of our study is to examine the extent to which migraines are associated with suicidal behavior (including suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts) in a well-characterized study of urban dwelling Ethiopian adults.


METHODS
We enrolled 1060 outpatient adults attending St. Paul hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographics, and lifestyle characteristics. Migraine classification was based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 diagnostic criteria. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess depression and suicidal behaviors (i.e. ideation, plans and attempts). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).


RESULTS
The prevalence of suicidal behavior was 15.1%, with a higher suicidal behavior among those who had migraines (61.9%). After adjusting for confounders including substance use and socio-demographic factors, migraine was associated with a 2.7-fold increased odds of suicidal behavior (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.88-3.89). When stratified by their history of depression in the past year, migraine without depression was significantly associated with suicidal behavior (AOR: 2.27, 95% Cl: 1.49-3.46). The odds of suicidal behavior did not reach statistical significance in migraineurs with depression (AOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 0.40-6.69).


CONCLUSION
Our study indicates that migraine is associated with increased odds of suicidal behavior in this population. Given the serious public health implications this has, attention should be given to the treatment and management of migraine at a community level.",29433452,2018,Association between migraine and suicidal behavior among Ethiopian adults.
228,"BACKGROUND
Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually. Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan.


METHOD
This study was based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework of scoping review, combining peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet.com were searched from the beginning of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language.


RESULTS
Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides was mentioned in only three studies.


CONCLUSIONS
This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors.",29433468,2018,Suicide and deliberate self-harm in Pakistan: a scoping review.

Patients with advanced lung cancer (LC) or malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) exhibit limitation of exercise capacities and alteration of quality of life (QoL) induced by cancer and its treatment. Few studies assessed pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in these chemotherapy-treated patients, and none evaluated a home-based PR program.


METHODS
In this prospective uncontrolled observational pilot study, patients treated by chemotherapy for LC or MPM were screened for a home-based PR program combining exercise training with global cares including therapeutic education and psychosocial management. Feasibility and safety were evaluated by attendance and adherence to PR program. Various exercise tolerance tests, including 6-min walk test (6MWT) and 6-min stepper test (6MST), were performed before and after PR associated with, QoL and psychological assessment (VSRQ and HAD, respectively).


RESULTS
243 patients were considered eligible but only 71 (60.6 ± 8.8 years) started a PR and 47 completed the program. Refusals to participate were mostly related to lack of motivation whereas withdrawals to PR were related to cancer-related medical issues. No adverse event related to PR was observed. Baseline 6MWT distance was associated with performance status (r = - 0.45, p = 0.001) and mMRC dyspnea scale (r = - 0.49, p < 0.001) but not with lung cancer stage. Post-PR reassessment showed 6MWT stability and 6MST improvement in patients who completed the program. Daily physical activity (p = 0.007) and anxiety (p = 0.02) scores were significantly improved.


CONCLUSIONS
Home-based PR was feasible and safe in patients with advanced LC or MPM. Exercise capacities stability in patients who completed the PR program suggests that PR might be beneficial.

Tinnitus service provision in the United Kingdom has been investigated from the healthcare provider's perspective demonstrating considerable regional variation particularly regarding availability of psychological treatments. An audiological-based tinnitus service, however, was reportedly available for all tinnitus patients in the UK. The aim of the current study was to define and evaluate nationwide tinnitus healthcare services from the patients' viewpoint.


METHODS
Secondary analyses were performed on data from a 33-item questionnaire provided by the British Tinnitus Association. The questionnaire had been distributed via email and social media.


RESULTS
Responses from 937 participants who had or had previously experienced tinnitus were analysed. All but one person had at some time consulted their GP. About one in five received medication in primary care. The majority were referred to secondary care, generally an ENT surgeon or audiovestibular physician; some were referred directly to audiological services. In secondary care the majority underwent audiometric testing and over half underwent MRI scanning. Drugs were prescribed less frequently in secondary care. About one third of patients were referred onwards from diagnostic services in secondary care to receive therapeutic interventions for tinnitus. Therapy was generally delivered by an audiologist or hearing therapist. Just under two fifths of people discharged from secondary care returned to their GP, with most returning within one year. Over a third of this group were re-referred to secondary care. Few patients saw a psychologist (2.6%) though some psychological treatments were delivered by appropriately trained audiologists. Negative counselling from healthcare professionals in both primary and secondary care settings was reported.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the UK has developed a national service for patients with tinnitus many people find it difficult to access, being blocked at the primary care level or after secondary care diagnostic services. Many of those discharged from secondary care return to their GP within a short space of time and are re-referred to secondary care creating an unsatisfactory and expensive revolving-door pattern of healthcare. Despite psychological treatment modalities having the best evidence base for successful tinnitus management, only a minority of tinnitus patients ever get to meet a psychologist.",29433479,2018,Tinnitus services in the United Kingdom: a survey of patient experiences.

Hospital stay represents the opportunity for a change of therapy, about which patients may not know indications, contraindications, and mode of administration, which may lead to dosing errors, drug interactions, side effects, etc. It is therefore vital to communicate appropriate information to the discharged patient with a new prescription drug. The purpose of the study was to evaluate: 1) how communication about new chronic therapies is managed at hospital discharge and what kind of information is provided to patients; 2) to what extent patients are aware and confident in the management of these medications; 3) whether the way communication is provided affects patients' awareness and self-confidence in the management of these therapies.


METHODS
Participants were adult patients who were prescribed at least one new chronic medication at hospital discharge. A telephone interview after hospital discharge was performed to assess whether or not hospital healthcare personnel had given information about prescribed therapies and which aspects of therapies had been object of information.


RESULTS
Five hundred thirty patients were interviewed. 67.7% reported having received counseling by the hospital physician, while 32.3% by discharge form. Basic information on treatment was provided to the great majority of patients, whereas only few patients reported to have been informed about eventual side effects and related behavior in case of side effects.

METHODS
In-depth interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data from cervical cancer patients in a health facility in the Volta Region of Ghana. Data processing was done using the R software package for Qualitative Data Analysis (RQDA) and a thematic approach was used to analyse and present the results.


RESULTS
The results show that cervical cancer patients adopted personal and psychological strategies such as sexual abstinence, personal hygiene, and disease denial to cope with the condition. Respondents also described social, financial and non-material support services they received from family members and the church as critical resources, which helped them to manage the conditions of the disease. Respondents also reported that faith healing, herbal and orthodox medicines helped them to manage the symptoms of the disease.


CONCLUSIONS

Methotrexate (MTX), commonly used in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), frequently has to be discontinued due to intolerance with anticipatory and associative gastrointestinal adverse effects. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological method where dysfunctional experiences and memories are reprocessed by recall combined with bilateral eye movements. The objective of this study was to assess efficacy of EMDR for treatment of MTX intolerance in JIA patients.


METHODS
We performed an open prospective study on consecutive JIA patients with MTX intolerance. Intolerance was determined using the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score (MISS) questionnaire prior to treatment, directly after treatment and after four months. Health-related quality of life was determined using the PedsQL prior to and four months after treatment. Patients were treated according to an institutional EMDR protocol with 8 sessions over two weeks. Changes in MISS and PedsQL were analyzed using non-parametric statistics.


RESULTS
Eighteen patients with MTX intolerance (median MISS at inclusion 16.5, IQR = 11.75-20.25) were included. Directly after treatment, MTX intolerance symptoms were significantly improved (median MISS 1 (IQR = 0-2). After four months, median MISS score was at 6.5 (IQR = 2.75-12.25, p = 0.001), with 9/18 patients showing MISS scores ≥6. Median PedsQL after 4 months improved significantly from 77.6% to 85.3% (p = 0.008).

Outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may result in death, increased morbidity, and change in quality of life (QOL). This study explores health-related QOL of first-time patients following AMI.


METHODS
This cross-sectional study used a sample of patients with first-time AMI experienced between April 2011 and March 2015 at a tertiary health institution. Recruited patients belonged to different post-AMI periods: 2-10 weeks, 5-22 months, and > 22 months to 4 years post AMI. Inclusion criteria were not confused and communicating freely. Exclusion criteria were non-contactable, refusing to participate, and deceased. One-on-one interviews were conducted using the validated and pre-tested Quality of Life after Myocardial Infarction (QLMI) questionnaire. QOL of patients after AMI was evaluated at each period. Descriptive, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and regression analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24.


RESULTS
A total of 534 participant interviews (overall response rate 65.4%) were conducted. Interviewees were predominantly male (67%), aged 51-65 years (45%), Indo-Trinidadian (81.2%), NSTEMI (64.4%), and hypertensive (72.4%). Overall QOL improved over time and in all domains: Emotional, Physical, and Social. Lower QOL was found among women, patients with NSTEMI, and diabetics in all domains; in patients with hypertension and renal disease in the Physical and Social domains only; and in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in the Physical domain only. Self-reported stress and lack of exercise were associated with lower QOL while drinking alcohol and eating out were related to better QOL. Hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and ethnicity showed no association with QOL. Declining QOL in the Physical domain with age was also found. The leading components of QOL were self-confidence and social exclusion (early post AMI), lack of self-confidence (intermediate post AMI), and tearfulness (late post AMI).


CONCLUSIONS
QOL in AMI survivors improves over time. Female gender, NSTEMI, diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, stress, and lack of exercise were associated with lower QOL while hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and ethnicity showed no association with QOL.

Pancreatic cancer characterizes high recurrence and poor prognosis. In clinical practice, radiotherapy is widely used for pancreatic cancer treatment. However, the outcome remains undesirable due to tumor repopulation and following recurrence and metastasis after radiation. So, it is highly needed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms and accordingly develop therapeutic strategies. Our previous studies revealed that dying cells from chemoradiation could stimulate repopulation of surviving pancreatic cancer cells. However, we still knew little how dying cells provoke pancreatic cancer cell repopulation. We herein would explore the significance of TGF-β2 changes and investigate the modulation of microRNA-193a (miR-193a), and identify their contributions to pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis.


METHODS
In vitro and in vivo repopulation models were established to mimic the biological processes of pancreatic cancer after radiation. Western blot, real-time PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assays were accordingly used to detect miR-193a and TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signalings at the level of molecular, cellular and experimental animal model, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis, wound healing and transwell assay, vascular endothelial cell penetration experiment, and bioluminescence imaging were employed to assessthe biological behaviors of pancreatic cancer after different treatments. Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mice models were established to evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-193a antagonist on pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis after radiation.


RESULTS
miR-193a was highly expressed in the irradiated pancreatic cancer dying cells, accordingly elevated the level of miR-193a in surviving cells, and further promoted pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. miR-193a accelerated pancreatic cancer cell cycle and stimulated cell proliferation and repopulation through inhibiting TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII/SMADs/E2F6/c-Myc signaling, and even destroyed normal intercellular junctions and promoted metastasis via repressing TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII/ARHGEF15/ABL2 pathway. Knockdown of miR-193a or restoration of TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signaling in pancreatic cancer cells was found to block pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis after radiation. In PDX models, the treatment in combination with miR-193a antagonist and radiation was found to dramatically inhibit pancreatic cancer cell repopulation and metastasis, and further improved the survival after radiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated that miR-193a stimulated pancreatic cancer cell repopulation and metastasis through modulating TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signalings, and miR-193a might be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer repopulation and metastasis.",29433538,2018,microRNA-193a stimulates pancreatic cancer cell repopulation and metastasis through modulating TGF-β2/TGF-βRIII signalings.

Delirium is a frequent and detrimental complication of inpatient hospitalization. Multicomponent intervention in selected groups has been shown to prevent and treat delirium, though little data exists on the effect of intervention in neurological patients. We studied the efficacy of a multicomponent delirium care pathway implemented on a largely neurology and neurosurgery hospital ward among unselected patients.


METHODS
We incorporated a multicomponent delirium care pathway into the workflow of a university hospital for patients older than 50 years. The pathway involved risk-stratification for development of delirium, delirium screening, and non-pharmacologic behavioral prevention and intervention. We then retrospectively reviewed admissions before and after implementation of the care pathway. Our primary endpoint was incidence of delirium; secondary endpoints included delirium days, length of stay, restraint use, readmission rates, and discharge disposition.


RESULTS
Seven hundred ninety eight admissions from before the delirium care pathway went into effect and 797 admissions from afterwards were reviewed. Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Delirium incidence between the two groups did not change (7.0% before vs 7.2% after, p = 0.89). Length of stay among delirious patients significantly decreased after implementation of the delirium care pathway (9.60 before vs 7.06 after, β = - 0.16, adjusted p-value = 0.001).


CONCLUSION
Implementation of a delirium care pathway on a neurosciences ward was not associated with changes in the rate of delirium development, though length of stay among delirious patients decreased. In a largely neurologic population, multicomponent intervention to prevent and treat delirium may not change delirium incidence, but may be effective in mitigating delirium complications.",29433572,2018,Evaluation of a multicomponent pathway to address inpatient delirium on a neurosciences ward.

At the same time, this superhybrid BiMo0.015V0.985O4 composite successfully acted as a sensing unit in a photoelectrochemical platform for antioxidant capacity evaluation in foodstuffs. The related mechanism was further unearthed and discussed in-depth. Such a straightforward yet cogent principle was also applied to our integrated device for the ""smart"" analysis of the global antioxidant capacity, whereby collected data can be treated as a nutritive value index for routine quality control in the food industry. On the basis of this achievement, it is anticipated that mobile app-based quantitative antioxidant capacity detection will soon be realized.",29435212,2015,Photoelectrochemical device based on Mo-doped BiVO4 enables smart analysis of the global antioxidant capacity in food.
239,"OBJECTIVE
To assess the effectiveness of a school and family based healthy lifestyle programme (WAVES intervention) compared with usual practice, in preventing childhood obesity.


DESIGN
Cluster randomised controlled trial.


SETTING
UK primary schools from the West Midlands.


PARTICIPANTS
200 schools were randomly selected from all state run primary schools within 35 miles of the study centre (n=980), oversampling those with high minority ethnic populations. These schools were randomly ordered and sequentially invited to participate. 144 eligible schools were approached to achieve the target recruitment of 54 schools. After baseline measurements 1467 year 1 pupils aged 5 and 6 years (control: 28 schools, 778 pupils) were randomised, using a blocked balancing algorithm. 53 schools remained in the trial and data on 1287 (87.7%) and 1169 (79.7%) pupils were available at first follow-up (15 month) and second follow-up (30 month), respectively.


INTERVENTIONS
The 12 month intervention encouraged healthy eating and physical activity, including a daily additional 30 minute school time physical activity opportunity, a six week interactive skill based programme in conjunction with Aston Villa football club, signposting of local family physical activity opportunities through mail-outs every six months, and termly school led family workshops on healthy cooking skills.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The protocol defined primary outcomes, assessed blind to allocation, were between arm difference in body mass index (BMI) z score at 15 and 30 months. Secondary outcomes were further anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, and psychological measurements, and difference in BMI z score at 39 months in a subset.


RESULTS
Data for primary outcome analyses were: baseline, 54 schools: 1392 pupils (732 controls); first follow-up (15 months post-baseline), 53 schools: 1249 pupils (675 controls); second follow-up (30 months post-baseline), 53 schools: 1145 pupils (621 controls). The mean BMI z score was non-significantly lower in the intervention arm compared with the control arm at 15 months (mean difference -0.075 (95% confidence interval -0.183 to 0.033, P=0.18) in the baseline adjusted models. At 30 months the mean difference was -0.027 (-0.137 to 0.083, P=0.63). There was no statistically significant difference between groups for other anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, or psychological measurements (including assessment of harm).


CONCLUSIONS
The primary analyses suggest that this experiential focused intervention had no statistically significant effect on BMI z score or on preventing childhood obesity. Schools are unlikely to impact on the childhood obesity epidemic by incorporating such interventions without wider support across multiple sectors and environments.

240,"A hallmark of social microorganisms is their ability to engage in complex and coordinated behaviors that depend on cooperative and synchronized actions among many cells. For instance, myxobacteria use an aggregation strategy to form multicellular, spore-filled fruiting bodies in response to starvation. One barrier to the synchronization process is physiological heterogeneity within clonal populations. How myxobacteria cope with these physiological differences is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the interactions between closely related but physiologically distinct Myxococcus xanthus populations. We used a genetic approach to create amino acid auxotrophs and tested how they interact with a parental prototroph strain. Importantly, we found that auxotrophs were killed by their prototroph siblings when the former were starved for amino acids but not when grown on rich medium or when both strains were starved. This antagonism depended on the type VI secretion system (T6SS) as well as gliding motility; in particular, we identified the effector-immunity pair (TsxEI) as the mediator of this killing. This sibling antagonism resulted from lower levels of the TsxI immunity protein in the starved population. Thus, when starving auxotrophs were mixed with nonstarving prototrophs, the auxotrophs were susceptible to intoxication by the TsxE effector delivered by the T6SS from the prototrophs. Furthermore, our results suggested that homogeneously starving populations have reduced T6SS activity and, therefore, do not antagonize each other. We conclude that heterogeneous populations of M. xanthus use T6SS-dependent killing to eliminate starving or less-fit cells, thus facilitating the attainment of homeostasis within a population and the synchronization of behaviors.IMPORTANCE Social bacteria employ elaborate strategies to adapt to environmental challenges. One means to prepare for unpredictable changes is for clonal populations to contain individuals with diverse physiological states. These subpopulations will differentially respond to new environmental conditions, ensuring that some cells will better adapt. However, for social bacteria physiological heterogeneity may impede the ability of a clonal population to synchronize their behaviors. By using a highly cooperative and synchronizable model organism, M. xanthus, we asked how physiological differences between interacting siblings impacted their collective behaviors. Physiological heterogeneity was experimentally designed such that one population starved while the other grew when mixed. We found that these differences led to social conflict where more-fit individuals killed their less-fit siblings. For the first time, we report that the T6SS nanoweapon mediates antagonism between siblings, resulting in myxobacterial populations becoming more synchronized to conduct social behaviors.",29437919,2018,Physiological Heterogeneity Triggers Sibling Conflict Mediated by the Type VI Secretion System in an Aggregative Multicellular Bacterium.
241,"OBJECTIVES
Elevated levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of anxiety and internal sensations) is highly common among adults who smoke, and contributes to several maladaptive smoking beliefs and behaviors. AS is comprised of 3 empirically established factors, relating to fears of social concerns, fears of physical symptoms, and fears of cognitive dyscontrol. Relatively few studies have examined how these 3 subscales pertain to smoking processes. The aim of the present investigation was to examine, among treatment-seeking adults who smoke, the interactive effects of AS-physical and cognitive concerns in relation to: perceived barriers to smoking cessation; smoking-related negative reinforcement expectancies; and smoking-related avoidance and inflexibility.


METHODS
Participants included 470 adults who smoke (47.8% female; mean age 37.2, SD 13.5), who were recruited to participate in a smoking-cessation treatment study. At the baseline assessment, participants completed self-report measures, including the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, Barriers to Cessation Scale, Smoking Consequences Questionnaire, and Avoidance and Inflexibility Scale.


RESULTS
Results indicated that after controlling for the effects of sex, cigarette dependence, alcohol problems, tobacco-related medical illness, current axis 1 disorder, and AS-social concerns, a significant interaction emerged, such that the association between AS-cognitive concerns and the studied smoking-based cognitions were stronger among lower levels of AS-physical concerns (but not higher physical concerns).


CONCLUSIONS
The current findings suggest that it may be beneficial to provide specialized smoking-cessation interventions for certain subgroups of adults who smoke, such as those with different AS profiles, to promote healthier beliefs about quitting.",29438156,2018,Anxiety Sensitivity Physical and Cognitive Concerns in Relation to Smoking-oriented Cognition: An Examination Among Treatment-seeking Adults Who Smoke.
242,"Tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus play a role in inhibiting prolactin (PRL) secretion from the anterior pituitary. PRL is involved in a variety of behaviors, including feeding. Consequently, we hypothesized that fasting might reduce the activity of TIDA neurons, which might alter PRL secretion. However, direct examinations of TIDA neuron activity are difficult. Recently, transgenic mice were generated that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene. We first determined that GFP in the dorsomedial ARC was a reliable marker of TIDA neurons. Then, we performed electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry in GFP-labeled TIDA neurons to examine whether different feeding conditions could change their activity. Eight-week-old male mice were fed or fasted for 24 h. After sacrifice, we prepared acutely isolated brain slices for conducting whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. TIDA neurons were identified with fluorescence microscopy. The mean amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was significantly reduced in fasting mice compared to fed mice, but different feeding conditions did not affect the mean mEPSC intervals. This result suggested that fasting reduced the number of excitatory synaptic inputs to TIDA neurons. To determine whether a reduction in excitatory synaptic inputs would cause a reduction in TIDA neuron activity, we examined the effect of 24-h fasting on c-Fos expression in the ARC. We found that fasting significantly reduced the number of Fos-positive TIDA neurons. In addition, serum PRL levels were significantly increased. Taken together, the present findings suggested that short-term fasting attenuated TIDA neuron activity.",29438798,2018,Short-term fasting decreases excitatory synaptic inputs to ventromedial tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons and attenuates their activity in male mice.
243,"BACKGROUND
Although aberrant visual attention has been identified in infants at high familial risk for autism, the developmental emergence of atypical attention remains unclear. Integrating biological measures of attention into prospective high-risk infant studies may inform more nuanced developmental trajectories, clarifying the onset and course of atypical attention and potentially advancing early screening or treatment protocols. Heart rate-defined sustained attention (HRDSA) is a well-validated biological measure of attentional engagement that, in non-clinical infant populations, provides incremental information about attentional engagement beyond looking behaviors alone. The present study aimed to examine the characteristics and clinical correlates of HRDSA in high-risk infants, informing whether HRDSA may operate as a promising biological measure of attention and clinical symptoms in this population.


METHODS
We examined age-related patterns of HRDSA during a passive looking task in 5- to 14-month-old high-risk infant siblings of children with autism (n = 21) compared to low-risk controls (n = 21), with most participants contributing multiple assessments. Emergent autism features were measured using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule at 24 months. Primary dependent variables included the proportion of time in behavioral attention, proportion of time in HRDSA, and average heart rate deceleration during HRDSA. For each variable, we used nested multilevel models to examine whether attention differed by group, as well as whether attention predicted emergent autism features among high-risk infant siblings.


RESULTS
As expected, HRDSA served as a global biological measure of attention in high-risk infants, predicting greater variability in group risk status than behavioral looking alone. Among high-risk infants, more severe ASD features were also associated with increasingly shallow heart rate deceleration during HRDSA across development, suggesting abnormal qualities of HRDSA may inform individual differences within this population.


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary findings provide initial evidence that HRDSA may offer a sensitive, affordable, and portable biological measure of attention that may enhance understanding of atypical attention in high-risk infants. Using this method, we also provide initial evidence that atypical patterns of heart activity previously reported in children and adults with autism may emerge in the first year of life, warranting further study of how HRDSA may specifically inform attention profiles in ASD.",29439664,2018,Heart rate-defined sustained attention in infants at risk for autism.
244,"BACKGROUND
Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), shown to be associated with health benefits, is not well-characterized in preschool-aged children. MVPA is commonly described as a threshold amount to achieve. We examined a novel way to characterize MVPA patterns in preschool-aged children by gender and age.


METHODS
Preschool-aged children from Nashville, TN and Minneapolis, MN wore triaxial accelerometers. Four distinct MVPA patterns were identified: isolated spurt (IS), isolated sustained activity (ISA), clustered spurt (CS), and clustered sustained activity (CSA). Multivariable linear regression models were used to test associations of gender and age with each pattern.


RESULTS
One thousand one hundred thirty-one children (3.9 years old, 51% girls, 30% overweight, 11% obese, and 76% Hispanic) wore accelerometers for 12.9 (SD = 1.4) hours/day for 6.7 (SD = 0.7) days. Children spent 53% of wear time in sedentary behavior and 13% in MVPA. On average, boys and girls achieved > 90 min/day of MVPA (98.2 min, SD = 32.3). Most MVPA (80%) was obtained in spurt-like (IS and CS) MVPA; however, girls spent a higher proportion of MVPA in IS and CS, and lower proportion of time in CSA (all p < 0.001). Controlling for gender, an increase of 1-year in age corresponded to a 1.5% increase in CSA (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
How MVPA was obtained varied depending on the gender and age of the child. On average, boys spent more time in sustained MVPA than girls and MVPA was more sustained in older children. Utilizing these patterns could inform PA practice and policy guidelines.

245,"BACKGROUND
Although Short Form (SF)-12 × 2® has been extensively studied and used as a valid measure of health-related quality of life in a variety of population groups, no systematic studies have described the reliability of the measure in patients with behavioral conditions or serious mental illness (SMI).


METHODS AND RESULTS
We assessed the internal consistency, split-half reliability and annual test-retest correlations in a sample of 1587 participants with either a combination of physical and behavioral conditions or SMI. The Mosier's alpha was 0.70 for the Physical Composite Scale (PCS) and 0.69 for the Mental Health Composite Scale (MCS), indicating good internal consistency. We observed strong correlations between physical functioning, physical role and body pain scales (r = 0.55-0.56), and between social functioning, emotional role, and mental health (r = 0.53-0.58). We calculated split-half reliabilities to be 0.74 for physical functioning, 0.75 for physical role, 0.73 for emotional role and 0.65 for mental health respectively. We assessed the annual test-retest correlation using intraclass correlation (ICC) and found an ICC of 0.61 for PCS and 0.57 for MCS composite scores, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and CRG. We found no decline in the correlations between baseline and the following study years until year 3.

246,"BACKGROUND
Based on studies conducted in the global north, it is well documented that those who feel stigmatized by overweight/obesity can suffer extreme emotional distress, be subject to (often legal and socially-acceptable) discrimination, and adjust diet and exercise behaviors. These lead to significant negative health impacts, including depression and further weight gain. To date, weight-related stigma has been conceptualized as a problem particular to the highest income, industrialized, historically thin-valorizing societies like the US, Australasia, and Western Europe.


MAIN BODY
There is limited but highly suggestive evidence that obesity stigma is an emergent phenomenon that affects populations across the global south. Emergent evidence includes: implicit and explicit measures showing very high levels of weight stigma in middle and low-income countries, complex ethnographic evidence of widespread anti-fat beliefs even where fat-positivity endures, the globalization of new forms of ""fat talk,"" and evidence of the emotional and material damage of weight-related rejection or mistreatment even where severe undernutrition is still a major challenge.


CONCLUSION
Recognizing weight stigma as a global health problem has significant implications for how public health conceives and implements appropriate responses to the growing ""obesity epidemic"" in middle and lower income settings.",29439728,2018,Obesity stigma as a globalizing health challenge.
247,"Culture evolves according to dynamics on multiple temporal scales, from individuals' minute-by-minute behaviour to millennia of cultural accumulation that give rise to population-level differences. These dynamics act on a range of entities-including behavioural sequences, ideas and artefacts as well as individuals, populations and whole species-and involve mechanisms at multiple levels, from neurons in brains to inter-population interactions. Studying such complex phenomena requires an integration of perspectives from a diverse array of fields, as well as bridging gaps between traditionally disparate areas of study. In this article, which also serves as an introduction to the current special issue, we highlight some specific respects in which the study of cultural evolution has benefited and should continue to benefit from an integrative approach. We showcase a number of pioneering studies of cultural evolution that bring together numerous disciplines. These studies illustrate the value of perspectives from different fields for understanding cultural evolution, such as cognitive science and neuroanatomy, behavioural ecology, population dynamics, and evolutionary genetics. They also underscore the importance of understanding cultural processes when interpreting research about human genetics, neuroscience, behaviour and evolution.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",29440515,2018,Integrative studies of cultural evolution: crossing disciplinary boundaries to produce new insights.
248,"Language plays a pivotal role in the evolution of human culture, yet the evolution of the capacity for language-uniquely within the hominin lineage-remains little understood. Bringing together insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, archaeology and behavioural ecology, we hypothesize that this singular occurrence was triggered by exaptation, or 'hijacking', of existing cognitive mechanisms related to sequential processing and motor execution. Observed coupling of the communication system with circuits related to complex action planning and control supports this proposition, but the prehistoric ecological contexts in which this coupling may have occurred and its adaptive value remain elusive. Evolutionary reasoning rules out most existing hypotheses regarding the ecological context of language evolution, which focus on ultimate explanations and ignore proximate mechanisms. Coupling of communication and motor systems, although possible in a short period on evolutionary timescales, required a multi-stepped adaptive process, involving multiple genes and gene networks. We suggest that the behavioural context that exerted the selective pressure to drive these sequential adaptations had to be one in which each of the systems undergoing coupling was independently necessary or highly beneficial, as well as frequent and recurring over evolutionary time. One such context could have been the teaching of tool production or tool use. In the present study, we propose the Cognitive Coupling hypothesis, which brings together these insights and outlines a unifying theory for the evolution of the capacity for language.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",29440518,2018,The evolution of the capacity for language: the ecological context and adaptive value of a process of cognitive hijacking.
249,"Culture is a human universal, yet it is a source of variation in human psychology, behaviour and development. Developmental researchers are now expanding the geographical scope of research to include populations beyond relatively wealthy Western communities. However, culture and context still play a secondary role in the theoretical grounding of developmental psychology research, far too often. In this paper, we highlight four false assumptions that are common in psychology, and that detract from the quality of both standard and cross-cultural research in development. These assumptions are: (i) the universality assumption, that empirical uniformity is evidence for universality, while any variation is evidence for culturally derived variation; (ii) the Western centrality assumption, that Western populations represent a normal and/or healthy standard against which development in all societies can be compared; (iii) the deficit assumption, that population-level differences in developmental timing or outcomes are necessarily due to something lacking among non-Western populations; and (iv) the equivalency assumption, that using identical research methods will necessarily produce equivalent and externally valid data, across disparate cultural contexts. For each assumption, we draw on cultural evolutionary theory to critique and replace the assumption with a theoretically grounded approach to culture in development. We support these suggestions with positive examples drawn from research in development. Finally, we conclude with a call for researchers to take reasonable steps towards more fully incorporating culture and context into studies of development, by expanding their participant pools in strategic ways. This will lead to a more inclusive and therefore more accurate description of human development.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",29440524,2018,Variation is the universal: making cultural evolution work in developmental psychology.

In this study, we explore the impact of defect microstructures on the mechanical behavior of helium ion implanted nanocrystalline tungsten through nanoindentation. Softening was apparent across all implantation temperatures and attributed to bubble/cavity loaded grain boundaries suppressing the activation barrier for the onset of plasticity via grain boundary mediated dislocation nucleation.

Parents completed an inventory on children's exposure to a variety of odors and on their own odor awareness using the Odor Awareness Scale.

First, we herein show relationships between avoidant personality traits, blood biomarkers, hikikomori-related psychological features, and behavioural characteristics assessed by a trust game in non-hikikomori volunteers. Avoidant personality traits were negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and uric acid (UA) in men, and positively associated with fibrin degeneration products (FDP) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in women. Next, we recruited actual individuals with hikikomori, and compared avoidant personality traits, blood biomarkers, and psychological features between individuals with hikikomori and age-matched healthy controls. Individuals with hikikomori had higher avoidant personality scores in both sexes, and showed lower serum UA levels in men and lower HDL-C levels in women compared with healthy controls.

255,"Background
In India, roughly one-half of patients undergoing cancer treatment are unaware of their diagnosis or treatment. The intention of this study is to determine the prevalence of collusion and its influence on quality of life (QOL) among patients in palliative care settings.


Methodology
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 palliative care patients to assess the extent of knowledge about their diagnosis and prognosis. The caretakers and the treating doctors were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to assess if diagnosis was revealed to a patient. QOL of the patients was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire-C30 questionnaire.


Results
The prevalence of collusion was 37%, i.e., in more than one-third of the palliative care patients; caregivers restrained doctors from disclosing the diagnosis. The prevalence of collusion was less among patients with higher educational qualification (P = 0.027) and professionals (P = 0.025). Collusion was not associated with gender, type of family, place of residence, and socioeconomic status (SES). In multivariate regression, collusion (odds ratio = 10.53) was independently associated with poor QOL when adjusted for age, gender, place of residence, religion, educational status, family type, and SES.


Conclusion
Collusion is fairly prevalent and it worsens the QOL among cancer patients. Since the main driver for collusion is the strong desire among caregivers to protect the physical and psychological well-being, the findings of the study could motivate the caregiver for a more open and honest communication.",29440809,2018,Benefit or Harm?

256,"Purpose
The diagnosis of cancer and its treatment can make patients psychologically distressed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of psychological distress and social functioning in cancer patients and to assess the association of these parameters with the quality of life (QOL) experienced by the patient.


Patients and Methods
All cancer patients attending palliative care clinic who can understand and speak English or Tamil language were taken into the study. An interview technique with a questionnaire is used for data collection after informed consent. The questionnaire consisted of four sections, namely, demographic variables, general health questionnaire, WHO QOL-BREF, and SCARF social functioning index. All questionnaires were translated into the Tamil Language and were evaluated by the experts for content validity.


Results
The median scores obtained are psychological distress = 44 (11-98), WHO QOL = 64 (36-117), and social function = 51 (29-79). Out of 251 patients, 30% had severe psychological distress, 25.6% had poor QOL, and 23.2% were with severely affected social function. Skilled laborers had better scores compared to unskilled laborers (P < 0.05). Family size (<2 children) had a positive impact on the QOL (P = 0.008). Patients from urban locales had better social functioning than rural counterpart (P = 0.047), but no difference was observed in distress level or QOL. Increased growth hormone distress score of the patients had a negative impact on both QOL (r = -0.522) and social function (r = -0.244). QOL correlated positively with social function (r = +0.247).

258,"Background
Any educational program should be implemented with a good understanding of the population's beliefs. Therefore, the aims of this study were to validate the Arabic version of the Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale (OHBS-A) and assess the osteoprotective attitude among the Iraqi population.


Methods
A cross-sectional design, with a random cluster sampling method from the community, was used. The forward-backward-forward translation method was used to translate the questionnaire from English to Arabic. In addition, the Arabic version of Osteoporosis Knowledge Tool (OKT-A) and the Arabic version of Osteoporosis Self-Efficacy Scale (OSES-A) were used to assess the osteoprotective behaviors.


Results
The results showed good face validity and reliability. The construct validity analysis showed seven factors that explain 72.82% of the variance. In addition, the results revealed a low health belief score (149.95±35.936) with only 36.67% of the study population found to have a high OHBS-A level. The results showed significant differences among employment status, marital status, and osteoporosis (OP) awareness groups in relation to total OHBS-A scores. In addition, there were significant associations between age groups and OP awareness with health belief levels. Moreover, both exercise and calcium intake subscales of the Osteoporosis Knowledge Tool (OKT) positively correlated with all OHBS-A subscales. Exercise and calcium intake subscales of Osteoporosis Self-Efficacy Scale (OSES) positively correlated with the perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers toward exercise and calcium intake. The binary logistic regression analysis showed that OKT levels, OSES levels, and age were predictors of OHBS-A levels.

260,"Background
Safe and effective delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain is important for successful therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD).


Purpose
To develop Huperzine A (HupA)-loaded, mucoadhesive and targeted polylactide-co-glycoside (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) with surface modification by lactoferrin (Lf)-conjugated N-trimethylated chitosan (TMC) (HupA Lf-TMC NPs) for efficient intranasal delivery of HupA to the brain for AD treatment.


Methods
HupA Lf-TMC NPs were prepared using the emulsion-solvent evaporation method and optimized using the Box-Behnken design. The particle size, zeta potential, drug entrapment efficiency, adhesion and in vitro release behavior were investigated. The cellular uptake was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the NPs. In vivo imaging system was used to investigate brain targeting effect of NPs after intranasal administration. The biodistribution of Hup-A NPs after intranasal administration was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.


Results
Optimized HupA Lf-TMC NPs had a particle size of 153.2±13.7 nm, polydispersity index of 0.229±0.078, zeta potential of +35.6±5.2 mV, drug entrapment efficiency of 73.8%±5.7%, and sustained release in vitro over a 48 h period. Adsorption of mucin onto Lf-TMC NPs was 86.9%±1.8%, which was significantly higher than that onto PLGA NPs (32.1%±2.5%). HupA Lf-TMC NPs showed lower toxicity in the 16HBE cell line compared with HupA solution. Qualitative and quantitative cellular uptake experiments indicated that accumulation of Lf-TMC NPs was higher than nontargeted analogs in 16HBE and SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo imaging results showed that Lf-TMC NPs exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity in the brain and a longer residence time than nontargeted NPs. After intranasal administration, Lf-TMC NPs facilitated the distribution of HupA in the brain, and the values of the drug targeting index in the mouse olfactory bulb, cerebrum (with hippocampus removal), cerebellum, and hippocampus were about 2.0, 1.6, 1.9, and 1.9, respectively.

261,"Introduction
This study investigated the efficacy of Chinese calligraphy handwriting (CCH) for the awakening of patients under a vegetative state after stroke. The theories, the instrument, and the treatment protocols were reported. A single case of a severe stroke patient who was in a coma state for 2 years is presented in this study. The objectives were to apply finger writing as a new method to awaken a stroke patient in a coma state and to test the effect of this method in improving the patient's vegetative states over time.


Case presentation
A 55-year-old man suffered a severe stroke in 2004 which left him in a coma for 2 years without any systematic rehabilitation. A culture-based finger-writing method of visual-spatial intervention was then applied to improve his condition. The writing tasks involved aided viewing and finger tracing of sets of innovative characters with enriched visual-spatial and movement characteristics. Following regular treatment protocols involving diverse movement and sensory feedback, the patient was awakened after 12 months. As a consequence, the patient showed significant behavioral changes favoring enhanced focusing, alertness, visual scan, visual span, and quickened visual and motor responses. The treatment continued for another 12 months. As the treatment progressed, we gradually observed improvements in his attention span and mental concentration. His eye ball movements - the left eye in particular - were quickened and showed wider visual angularity in his focal vision. Currently, the patient can now watch television, engage in improved visual sighting, and focus on visual-spatial and cognitive-linguistic materials.


Conclusion
This CCH method of training by finger tracking has shown its effectiveness in awakening the patient from his coma state and in producing long-term, clinical outcomes that were similar from those that took place 10 years ago. This finding supports the efficacy of the system for clinical improvement of the patient's conditions.",29440902,2018,Chinese calligraphy handwriting (CCH): a case of rehabilitative awakening of a coma patient after stroke.

ADPKD is the fourth most common renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy. In this report, we present a detailed review of ADPKD, with a particular focus on its major economic, psychological, and social burden in affected patients. Treatment of this disease has been based on prophylactic and supportive measures. However, in recent years, new drugs have emerged as promising agents that may retard the progression of ADPKD, such as tolvaptan. In this report, we provide an in-depth discussion of tolvaptan, which has shown an effect in decreasing annual total kidney volume growth and renal function decline, thus slowing disease progression. The mechanism of action, side effects, and available data on cost-effectiveness are discussed together with the results of the first clinical trials and the most recent trials with regard to its efficacy and safety. Tolvaptan has recently received approval and been granted marketing authorization in Japan, Canada, Korea, Switzerland, and Europe. A demand for widely accepted guidelines for its use has emerged since its approval. The currently available series of recommendations and guidelines as to when to start treatment with tolvaptan, as well as which patients should be treated, are also reviewed in this report.

263,"Background
The nonuse of family planning methods remains a major public health concern in the low-and-middle-income countries, especially due to its impact on unwanted pregnancy, high rate of abortion, and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Various demographic and socioeconomic factors have been reported to be associated with the nonuse of family planning methods. In the present study, we aimed at assessing the influence of domestic violence (DV) on contraceptive use among ever married women in Nigeria.


Methods
Data on 22,275 women aged between 15 and 49 years were collected from the most recent Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2013. The outcome variable was contraceptive utilization status, and the main exposure variable was DV, which was assessed by the self-reported experience of physical and psychological abuse. Complex survey method was employed to account for the multistage design of the survey. Data analyses were performed by using bivariate and multivariable techniques.


Results
The mean age of the participants was 31.33±8.26. More than four fifths (84%) of the participants reported that they were not using any contraceptive methods at all. Lifetime prevalence of psychological and physical abuse was, respectively, 19.0% (95% CI =18.0-20.1) and 14.1% (95% CI =13.3-14.9). Women who reported physical abuse were 28% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =1.275; 95% CI =1.030-1.578), and those reported both physical and psychological abuse had 52% (AOR =1.520; 95% CI =1.132-2.042) higher odds of not using any contraception.


Conclusion
The rate of contraception nonuse was considerably high and was found to be significantly associated with DV. Thus, the high prevalence of DV may compromise the effectiveness of the family planning programs in the long run. Evidence-based intervention strategies should be developed to protect the health and reproductive rights of the vulnerable women and to reduce DV by giving the issue a wider recognition in public policy making.",29440938,2018,Domestic violence: a hidden barrier to contraceptive use among women in Nigeria.
264,"Bereaved individuals are increasingly considered at risk for negative psychological and physiological outcomes. Visual art modalities are often incorporated into grief therapy interventions, and clinical application of art therapy techniques with the bereaved has been widely documented. Although clinicians and recipients of these interventions advocate for their helpfulness in adapting to bereavement, research investigating the efficacy of visual art modalities has produced equivocal results and has not yet been synthesized to establish empirical support across settings. Accordingly, this review critically evaluates the existent literature on the effectiveness of visual art modalities with the bereaved and offers suggestions for future avenues of research. A total of 27 studies were included in the current review. Meta-analysis was not possible because of clinical heterogeneity and insufficient comparable data on outcome measures across studies. A narrative synthesis reports that therapeutic application of visual art modalities was associated with positive changes such as continuing bonds with the deceased and meaning making. Modest and conflicting preliminary evidence was found to support treatment effectiveness in alleviating negative grief symptoms such as general distress, functional impairment, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.",29440940,2018,The therapeutic effectiveness of using visual art modalities with the bereaved: a systematic review.
265,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder affecting the reproductive, metabolic and psychological health of women. Clinic-based studies indicate that sleep disturbances and disorders including obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness occur more frequently among women with PCOS compared to comparison groups without the syndrome. Evidence from the few available population-based studies is supportive. Women with PCOS tend to be overweight/obese, but this only partly accounts for their sleep problems as associations are generally upheld after adjustment for body mass index; sleep problems also occur in women with PCOS of normal weight. There are several, possibly bidirectional, pathways through which PCOS is associated with sleep disturbances. The pathophysiology of PCOS involves hyperandrogenemia, a form of insulin resistance unique to affected women, and possible changes in cortisol and melatonin secretion, arguably reflecting altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. Psychological and behavioral pathways are also likely to play a role, as anxiety and depression, smoking, alcohol use and lack of physical activity are also common among women with PCOS, partly in response to the distressing symptoms they experience. The specific impact of sleep disturbances on the health of women with PCOS is not yet clear; however, both PCOS and sleep disturbances are associated with deterioration in cardiometabolic health in the longer term and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Both immediate quality of life and longer-term health of women with PCOS are likely to benefit from diagnosis and management of sleep disorders as part of interdisciplinary health care.",29440941,2018,"Sleep disturbances in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: prevalence, pathophysiology, impact and management strategies."
266,"Vision is a key component of hummingbird behavior. Hummingbirds hover in front of flowers, guide their bills into them for foraging, and maneuver backwards to undock from them. Capturing insects is also an important foraging strategy for most hummingbirds. However, little is known about the visual sensory specializations hummingbirds use to guide these two foraging strategies. We characterized the hummingbird visual field configuration, degree of eye movement, and orientation of the centers of acute vision. Hummingbirds had a relatively narrow binocular field (~30°) that extended above and behind their heads. Their blind area was also relatively narrow (~23°), which increased their visual coverage (about 98% of their celestial hemisphere). Additionally, eye movement amplitude was relatively low (~9°), so their ability to converge or diverge their eyes was limited. We confirmed that hummingbirds have two centers of acute vision: a fovea centralis, projecting laterally, and an area temporalis, projecting more frontally. This retinal configuration is similar to other predatory species, which may allow hummingbirds to enhance their success at preying on insects. However, there is no evidence that their temporal area could visualize the bill tip or that eye movements could compensate for this constraint. Therefore, guidance of precise bill position during the process of docking occurs via indirect cues or directly with low visual acuity despite having a temporal center of acute vision. The large visual coverage may favor the detection of predators and competitors even while docking into a flower. Overall, hummingbird visual configuration does not seem specialized for flower docking.",29440985,2018,The Orientation of Visual Space from the Perspective of Hummingbirds.
267,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a pediatric genetic disease, characterized by motor neuron (MN) death, leading to progressive muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and, in the most severe cases, to death. Abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) have been reported in SMA, including neurofilament (NF) accumulation at presynaptic terminals, immature and smaller than normal endplates, reduced transmitter release, and, finally, muscle denervation. Here we have studied the role of agrin in SMAΔ7 mice, the experimental model of SMAII. We observed a 50% reduction in agrin expression levels in quadriceps of P10 SMA mice compared to age-matched WT controls. To counteract such condition, we treated SMA mice from birth onwards with therapeutic agrin biological NT-1654, an active splice variant of agrin retaining synaptogenic properties, which is also resistant to proteolytic cleavage by neurotrypsin. Mice were analyzed for behavior, muscle and NMJ histology, and survival. Motor behavior was significantly improved and survival was extended by treatment of SMA mice with NT-1654. At P10, H/E-stained sections of the quadriceps, a proximal muscle early involved in SMA, showed that NT-1654 treatment strongly prevented the size decrease of muscle fibers. Studies of NMJ morphology on whole-mount diaphragm preparations revealed that NT-1654-treated SMA mice had more mature NMJs and reduced NF accumulation, compared to vehicle-treated SMA mice. We conclude that increasing agrin function in SMA has beneficial outcomes on muscle fibers and NMJs as the agrin biological NT-1654 restores the crosstalk between muscle and MNs, delaying muscular atrophy, improving motor performance and extending survival.",29440993,2018,Increasing Agrin Function Antagonizes Muscle Atrophy and Motor Impairment in Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
268,"Animals rely heavily on their sense of olfaction to perform various vital interactions with an ever-in-flux environment. The turbulent and combinatorial nature of air-borne odorant cues demands the employment of various coding strategies, which allow the animal to attune to its internal needs and past or present experiences. Furthermore, these internal needs can be dependent on internal states such as hunger, reproductive state and sickness. Neuromodulation is a key component providing flexibility under such conditions. Understanding the contributions of neuromodulation, such as sensory neuron sensitization and choice bias requires manipulation of neuronal activity on a local and global scale. With Drosophila's genetic toolset, these manipulations are feasible and even allow a detailed look on the functional role of classical neuromodulators such as dopamine, octopamine and neuropeptides. The past years unraveled various mechanisms adapting chemosensory processing and perception to internal states such as hunger and reproductive state. However, future research should also investigate the mechanisms underlying other internal states including the modulatory influence of endogenous microbiota on Drosophila behavior. Furthermore, sickness induced by pathogenic infection could lead to novel insights as to the neuromodulators of circuits that integrate such a negative postingestive signal within the circuits governing olfactory behavior and learning. The enriched emporium of tools Drosophila provides will help to build a concrete picture of the influence of neuromodulation on olfaction and metabolism, adaptive behavior and our overall understanding of how a brain works.",29440990,2018,Internal State Dependent Odor Processing and Perception-The Role of Neuromodulation in the Fly Olfactory System.

To study this question, we elicited incentive-compatible measures of confidence and over-confidence in the lab and correlate them with measures of right hand 2D:4D, used as as a marker for the strength of prenatal testosterone exposure. We provide evidence that men with higher prenatal testosterone exposure (i.e., low 2D:4D ratio) are less likely to set unrealistically high expectations about their own performance. This in turn helps them to gain higher monetary rewards. Men exposed to low prenatal testosterone levels, instead, set unrealistically high expectations which results in self-defeating behavior.",29441000,2018,"Self-confidence, Overconfidence and Prenatal Testosterone Exposure: Evidence from the Lab."
270,"The aim of this study was to identify the existence of combinations of aggression components (Anger, Hostility, Physical Aggression and Verbal Aggression) that result in different profiles of aggressive behavior in children, as well as to test the differences between these profiles in scores of perfectionism, school refusal and affect. It is interesting to analyze these variables given: (a) their clinical relevance due to their close relationship with the overall psychopathology; and (b) the need for further evidence regarding how they are associated with aggressive behavior. The sample consisted of 1202 Spanish primary education students between the ages of 8 and 12. Three aggressive behavior profiles for children were identified using Latent Class Analysis (LCA): High Aggression (Z scores between 0.69 and 0.7), Moderate Aggression (Z scores between -0.39 and -0.47) and Low Aggression (Z scores between -1.36 and -1.58). These profiles were found for 49.08%, 38.46% and 12.48% of the sample, respectively. High Aggression scored significantly higher than Moderate Aggression and Low Aggression on Socially Prescribed Perfectionism (SPP), Self-Oriented Perfectionism (SOP), the first three factors of school refusal (i.e., FI. Negative Affective, FII. Social Aversion and/or Evaluation, FIII. To Pursue Attention), and Negative Affect (NA). In addition, Moderate Aggression also reported significantly higher scores than Low Aggression for the three first factors of school refusal and NA. Conversely, Low Aggression had significantly higher mean scores than High Aggression and Moderate Aggression on Positive Affect (PA). Results demonstrate that High Aggression was the most maladaptive profile having a high risk of psychological vulnerability. Aggression prevention programs should be sure to include strategies to overcome psychological problems that characterize children manifesting high levels of aggressive behavior.",29441002,2018,"Aggression Profiles in the Spanish Child Population: Differences in Perfectionism, School Refusal and Affect."
271,"There is burgeoning evidence that, among HIV+ adults, exposure to high levels of early life stress (ELS) is associated with increased cognitive impairment as well as brain volume abnormalities and elevated neuropsychiatric symptoms. Currently, we have a limited understanding of the degree to which cognitive difficulties observed in HIV+ High-ELS samples reflect underlying neural abnormalities rather than increases in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Here, we utilized a behavioral marker of cognitive function, reaction time intra-individual variability (RT-IIV), which is sensitive to both brain volume reductions and neuropsychiatric symptoms, to elucidate the unique contributions of brain volume abnormalities and neuropsychiatric symptoms to cognitive difficulties in HIV+ High-ELS adults. We assessed the relation of RT-IIV to neuropsychiatric symptom levels and total gray and white matter volumes in 44 HIV+ adults (26 with high ELS). RT-IIV was examined during a working memory task. Self-report measures assessed current neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify total gray and white matter volumes. Compared to Low-ELS participants, High-ELS participants exhibited elevated RT-IIV, elevated neuropsychiatric symptoms, and reduced gray and white matter volumes. Across the entire sample, RT-IIV was significantly associated with gray and white matter volumes, whereas significant associations with neuropsychiatric symptoms were not observed. In the High-ELS group, despite the presence of elevated neuropsychiatric symptom levels, brain volume reductions explained more than 13% of the variance in RT-IIV, whereas neuropsychiatric symptoms explained less than 1%. Collectively, these data provide evidence that, in HIV+ High-ELS adults, ELS-related cognitive difficulties (as indexed by RT-IIV) exhibit strong associations with global brain volumes, whereas ELS-related elevations in neuropsychiatric symptoms appear to contribute minimally to these cognitive difficulties. Such findings support a growing body of evidence indicating that high ELS exposure is a significant risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV+ adults. Further, these data highlight the need to better understand how ELS-related pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to volumetric and other neural abnormalities in HIV+ individuals.",29441001,2018,Early Life Stress-Related Elevations in Reaction Time Variability Are Associated with Brain Volume Reductions in HIV+ Adults.
272,"The olfactory sense is of crucial importance for animals, but their response to chemical stimuli is plastic and depends on their physiological state and prior experience. In many insect species, mating status influences the response to sex pheromones, but the underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. After mating, females of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis are no longer attracted to the male sex pheromone. Here we show that this post-mating behavioral switch is mediated by dopamine (DA). Females fed a DA-receptor antagonist prior to mating maintained their attraction to the male pheromone after mating while virgin females injected with DA became unresponsive. However, the switch is reversible as mated females regained their pheromone preference after appetitive learning. Feeding mated N. vitripennis females with antagonists of either octopamine- (OA) or DA-receptors prevented relearning of the pheromone preference suggesting that both receptors are involved in appetitive learning. Moreover, DA injection into mated females was sufficient to mimic the oviposition reward during odor conditioning with the male pheromone. Our data indicate that DA plays a key role in the plastic pheromone response of N. vitripennis females and reveal some striking parallels between insects and mammals in the neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying olfactory plasticity.",29441003,2018,The Post-mating Switch in the Pheromone Response of Nasonia Females Is Mediated by Dopamine and Can Be Reversed by Appetitive Learning.
273,"Humans can often recognize faces across viewpoints despite the large changes in low-level image properties a shift in viewpoint introduces. We present a behavioral and an fMRI adaptation experiment to investigate whether this viewpoint tolerance is reflected in the neural visual system and whether it can be manipulated through training. Participants saw training sequences of face images creating the appearance of a rotating head. Half of the sequences showed faces undergoing veridical changes in appearance across the rotation (non-morph condition). The other half were non-veridical: during rotation, the face simultaneously morphed into another face. This procedure should successfully associate frontal face views with side views of the same or a different identity, and, according to the temporal contiguity hypothesis, thus enhance viewpoint tolerance in the non-morph condition and/or break tolerance in the morph condition. Performance on the same/different task in the behavioral experiment (N = 20) was affected by training. There was a significant interaction between training (associated/not associated) and identity (same/different), mostly reflecting a higher confusion of different identities when they were associated during training. In the fMRI study (N = 20), fMRI adaptation effects were found for same-viewpoint images of untrained faces, but no adaptation for untrained faces was present across viewpoints. Only trained faces which were not morphed during training elicited a slight adaptation across viewpoints in face-selective regions. However, both in the behavioral and in the neural data the effects were small and weak from a statistical point of view. Overall, we conclude that the findings are not inconsistent with the proposal that temporal contiguity can influence viewpoint tolerance, with more evidence for tolerance when faces are not morphed during training.",29441006,2018,Temporal Contiguity Training Influences Behavioral and Neural Measures of Viewpoint Tolerance.

We report that soluble oligomers were specifically detected in the dog's blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via anti-oligomer- and anti-Aβ specific binders. Importantly, our results reveal the potent neurotoxic effects of the dog's CSF on cell viability and the seeding efficiency of the CSF-borne soluble oligomers on the thermodynamic activity and the aggregation kinetics of synthetic human Aβ.

275,"Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is characterized by deep alterations in behavior and personality. Although revised diagnostic criteria agree for executive dysfunction as most characteristic, impairments in social cognition are also suggested. The study aimed at identifying those neuropsychological and behavioral parameters best discriminating between bvFTD and healthy controls. Eighty six patients were diagnosed with possible or probable bvFTD according to Rascovsky et al. (2011) and compared with 43 healthy age-matched controls. Neuropsychological performance was assessed with a modified Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Stroop task, Trail Making Test (TMT), Hamasch-Five-Point Test (H5PT), and semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks. Behavior was assessed with the Apathy Evaluation Scale, Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale, and Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale. Each test's discriminatory power was investigated by Receiver Operating Characteristic curves calculating the area under the curve (AUC). bvFTD patients performed significantly worse than healthy controls in all neuropsychological tests. Discriminatory power (AUC) was highest in behavioral questionnaires, high in verbal fluency tasks and the RMET, and lower in executive function tests such as the Stroop task, TMT and H5PT. As fluency tasks depend on several cognitive functions, not only executive functions, results suggest that the RMET discriminated better between bvFTD and control subjects than other executive tests. Social cognition should be incorporated into diagnostic criteria for bvFTD in the future, such as in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, as already suggested in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.",29441012,2018,A Modified Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test Predicts Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia Better Than Executive Function Tests.
276,"Much of what we believe we know, we know through the testimony of others (Coady, 1992). While there has been long-standing evidence that people are sensitive to the characteristics of the sources of testimony, for example in the context of persuasion, researchers have only recently begun to explore the wider implications of source reliability considerations for the nature of our beliefs. Likewise, much remains to be established concerning what factors influence source reliability. In this paper, we examine, both theoretically and empirically, the implications of using message content as a cue to source reliability. We present a set of experiments examining the relationship between source information and message content in people's responses to simple communications. The results show that people spontaneously revise their beliefs in the reliability of the source on the basis of the expectedness of a source's claim and, conversely, adjust message impact by perceived reliability; hence source reliability and message content have a bi-directional relationship. The implications are discussed for a variety of psychological, philosophical and political issues such as belief polarization and dual-route models of persuasion.",29441029,2018,The Bi-directional Relationship between Source Characteristics and Message Content.
277,"Indirect observation is a recent concept in systematic observation. It largely involves analyzing textual material generated either indirectly from transcriptions of audio recordings of verbal behavior in natural settings (e.g., conversation, group discussions) or directly from narratives (e.g., letters of complaint, tweets, forum posts). It may also feature seemingly unobtrusive objects that can provide relevant insights into daily routines. All these materials constitute an extremely rich source of information for studying everyday life, and they are continuously growing with the burgeoning of new technologies for data recording, dissemination, and storage. Narratives are an excellent vehicle for studying everyday life, and quantitization is proposed as a means of integrating qualitative and quantitative elements. However, this analysis requires a structured system that enables researchers to analyze varying forms and sources of information objectively. In this paper, we present a methodological framework detailing the steps and decisions required to quantitatively analyze a set of data that was originally qualitative. We provide guidelines on study dimensions, text segmentation criteria, ad hoc observation instruments, data quality controls, and coding and preparation of text for quantitative analysis. The quality control stage is essential to ensure that the code matrices generated from the qualitative data are reliable. We provide examples of how an indirect observation study can produce data for quantitative analysis and also describe the different software tools available for the various stages of the process. The proposed method is framed within a specific mixed methods approach that involves collecting qualitative data and subsequently transforming these into matrices of codes (not frequencies) for quantitative analysis to detect underlying structures and behavioral patterns. The data collection and quality control procedures fully meet the requirement of flexibility and provide new perspectives on data integration in the study of biopsychosocial aspects in everyday contexts.",29441028,2018,Indirect Observation in Everyday Contexts: Concepts and Methodological Guidelines within a Mixed Methods Framework.

However, we argue there is no winning bias and that previous studies were confounded and based on small and specific data sets. We tested whether blue biases winning in judo using a very extensive judo data set (45,874 contests from all international judo tournaments between 2008 and 2014). In judo, the first called athlete for the fight used to wear the blue judogi but this was changed to the white judogi in 2011. This switch enabled us to compare the win bias before and after this change to isolate the effect of the color of the judogi. We found a significant win bias for the first called athlete, but this effect was not significantly related to the color of the judogi. The lack of a significant win effect of judogi color suggests that blue does not bias winning in judo, and that the blue-white pairing ensures an equal level of play. Our study shows the importance of thoroughly considering alternative explanations and using extensive datasets in color research in sports and psychology.",29441036,2018,Does Blue Uniform Color Enhance Winning Probability in Judo Contests?
279,"Despite differences in their function and domain-specific elements, syntactic processing in music and language is believed to share cognitive resources. This study aims to investigate whether the simultaneous processing of language and music share the use of a common syntactic processor or more general attentional resources. To investigate this matter we tested musicians and non-musicians using visually presented sentences and aurally presented melodies containing syntactic local and long-distance dependencies. Accuracy rates and reaction times of participants' responses were collected. In both sentences and melodies, unexpected syntactic anomalies were introduced. This is the first study to address the processing of local and long-distance dependencies in language and music combined while reducing the effect of sensory memory. Participants were instructed to focus on language (language session), music (music session), or both (dual session). In the language session, musicians and non-musicians performed comparably in terms of accuracy rates and reaction times. As expected, groups' differences appeared in the music session, with musicians being more accurate in their responses than non-musicians and only the latter showing an interaction between the accuracy rates for music and language syntax. In the dual session musicians were overall more accurate than non-musicians. However, both groups showed comparable behavior, by displaying an interaction between the accuracy rates for language and music syntax responses. In our study, accuracy rates seem to better capture the interaction between language and music syntax; and this interaction seems to indicate the use of distinct, however, interacting mechanisms as part of decision making strategy. This interaction seems to be subject of an increase of attentional load and domain proficiency. Our study contributes to the long-lasting debate about the commonalities between language and music by providing evidence for their interaction at a more domain-general level.",29441035,2018,Decision Making Strategy and the Simultaneous Processing of Syntactic Dependencies in Language and Music.
280,"During social interactions infants predict and evaluate other people's actions. Previous behavioral research found that infants' imitation of others' actions depends on these evaluations and is context-dependent: 1-year-olds predominantly imitated an unusual action (turning on a lamp with one's forehead) when the model's hands were free compared to when the model's hands were occupied or restrained. In the present study, we adapted this behavioral paradigm to a neurophysiological study measuring infants' brain activity while observing usual and unusual actions via electroencephalography. In particular, we measured differences in mu power (6 - 8 Hz) associated with motor activation. In a between-subjects design, 12- to 14-month-old infants watched videos of adult models demonstrating that their hands were either free or restrained. Subsequent test frames showed the models turning on a lamp or a soundbox by using their head or their hand. Results in the hands-free condition revealed that 12- to 14-month-olds displayed a reduction of mu power in frontal regions in response to unusual and thus unexpected actions (head touch) compared to usual and expected actions (hand touch). This may be explained by increased motor activation required for updating prior action predictions in response to unusual actions though alternative explanations in terms of general attention or cognitive control processes may also be considered. In the hands-restrained condition, responses in mu frequency band did not differ between action outcomes. This implies that unusual head-touch actions compared to hand-touch actions do not necessarily evoke a reduction of mu power. Thus, we conclude that reduction of mu frequency power is context-dependent during infants' action perception. Our results are interpreted in terms of motor system activity measured via changes in mu frequency band as being one important neural mechanism involved in action prediction and evaluation from early on.",29441034,2018,Reduced Mu Power in Response to Unusual Actions Is Context-Dependent in 1-Year-Olds.
281,"Memory is one of the most important cognitive functions in a person's life as it is essential for recalling personal memories and performing many everyday tasks. Although a huge number of studies have been conducted in the field, only a few of them investigated memory in realistic situations, due to methodological issues. The various tools that have been developed using virtual environments (VEs) have gained popularity in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology because they enable to create naturalistic and controlled situations, and are thus particularly adapted to the study of episodic memory (EM), for which an ecological evaluation is of prime importance. EM is the conscious recollection of personal events combined with their phenomenological and spatiotemporal encoding contexts. Using an original paradigm in a VE, the objective of the present study was to characterize the construction of episodic memories. While the concept of working memory has become central in the understanding of a wide range of cognitive functions, its role in the integration of episodic memories has seldom been assessed in an ecological context. This experiment aimed at filling this gap by studying how EM is affected by concurrent tasks requiring working memory resources in a realistic situation. Participants navigated in a virtual town and had to memorize as many elements in their spatiotemporal context as they could. During learning, participants had either to perform a concurrent task meant to prevent maintenance through the phonological loop, or a task aimed at preventing maintenance through the visuospatial sketchpad, or no concurrent task. EM was assessed in a recall test performed after learning through various scores measuring the what, where and when of the memories. Results showed that, compared to the control condition with no concurrent task, the prevention of maintenance through the phonological loop had a deleterious impact only on the encoding of central elements. By contrast, the prevention of visuo-spatial maintenance interfered both with the encoding of the temporal context and with the binding. These results suggest that the integration of realistic episodic memories relies on different working memory processes that depend on the nature of the traces.",29441037,2018,The Integration of Realistic Episodic Memories Relies on Different Working Memory Processes: Evidence from Virtual Navigation.
282,"Background
Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) are common structurally abnormal chromosomes that occur in 0.288% of cases of mental retardation. Isodicentric 15 (idic(15)) is common in sSMCs and usually leads to a rare chromosome disorder with distinctive clinical phenotypes, including early central hypotonia, developmental delay, epilepsy, and autistic behavior. It was previously shown that the partial tetrasomy 15q and partial hexasomy 15q syndromes are usually caused by one and two extra idic(15), respectively. Karyotypes containing a mosaic partial octosomy 15q resulting from three extra idic(15) have rarely been reported.


Case presentation
Two patients with profound intellectual impairment, development delay and hyperpigmentation were recruited for this study. The phenotype was relatively more severe in patient 1 than in patient 2. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood obtained from patients 1 and 2 revealed rare mosaic karyotypes containing sSMCs, i.e., mos 49,XX,+mar × 3[83]/48,XX,+mar × 2[7]/46,XX[10] and mos 48,XX,+mar × 2[72]/47,XX,+mar[28], respectively. The results of analyses of copy number variation (CNV) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, showed that the sSMCs were found to be idic(15) involving the Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndrome Critical Region (PWACR) genes and the P gene, with duplication sizes of 6.3 Mb and 9.7 Mb, respectively. DNA fingerprinting analysis of patient 1 showed a maternal origin for the idic(15). Both patients had mosaic idic(15) karyotypes: patient 1 had cells with a 15q partial octosomy (83%), and patient 2 had cells with a 15q partial hexasomy (72%).


Conclusions
We detected two rare mosaic idic(15) karyotypes that were associated with congenital abnormalities, including a rare mosaic octosomy of 15q11-q13. Our cases further validate the notion that the phenotypic severity is correlated with the level of mosaicism and the dosage effect of related genes in the proximal 15q.",29441129,2018,Rare partial octosomy and hexasomy of 15q11-q13 associated with intellectual impairment and development delay: report of two cases and review of literature.

There are only a few cases have been reported and the exact behavior of the disease is not clearly described. Here, we present a case from New York City incidentally found to have a cavitary lung lesion due to M. nebraskense.Case report: An 82-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dementia presented with constipation and urinary retention for 1 day. She had no fever, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, appetite change, or weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed retained fecal material in the colon, non-obstructing left renal calculus, and bilateral small pleural effusion with right-sided lung infiltrates. Subsequent CT scan of the chest showed 4.5 cm pleural-based opacity in right lung base with a small cavity. Sputum smear for Acid-fast bacilli was positive. Mycobacterial culture reported positive growth of M. nebraskense, while polymerase chain reaction returned negative for Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. With the patient asymptomatic and her constipation improved, she was discharged with plans for close follow-up as outpatient. Conclusion: M. nebraskense is a very rare nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.

Most of all because today, at the end of 2017, we are talking about the same principles from the ""Declaration on Primary Health Care"" from 1978, and the same goals as those in ""Health for all"" which are still current or perhaps even more current than when they were published for the first time in scientific and professional literature. This is a notorious fact, even though we are talking about ""Global Health"" and its determinants, in all countries of the world, regardless of their social wealth, and all existing resources, especially those, intended to organize health care. In the field of practice, public health has advanced in knowledge and methodology. Biomedical scientists have identified many causes of infectious diseases and developed methods to put them under control. Epidemiologists have identified risk factors that favor many chronic illnesses and information that can be used to reduce the risk of disease. Efforts to cleanse the environment have resulted in air and water that are far safer than half a century ago. Intensive educational efforts have convinced the health-care organizers to improve their health behavior that is to quit tobacco use, and a combination of drinking and driving. The ability to assess the populations' health behaviors and assess the share of health interventions has also significantly improved the availability of health-care databases and computer software capable of analyzing them.

286,"Background
For people with anorexia nervosa (AN), compulsive exercise is characterized by extreme concerns about the perceived negative consequences of stopping/reducing exercise, dysregulation of affect, and inflexible exercise routines. It is associated with increased eating disorder psychopathology and poor clinical outcome. However, its relationships with two important clinical issues, quality of life (QoL) and motivation to change, are currently unknown. This study aimed to assess the cross-sectional relationships between compulsive exercise, QoL, psychological distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms, and obsessive-compulsive traits) and motivation to change in patients with AN.


Method
A total of 78 adults with AN participated in this study, which was nested within a randomized controlled trial of psychological treatments for AN. At baseline (pre-treatment), participants completed questionnaires assessing compulsive exercise, eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, QoL, psychological distress and motivation to change.


Results
Baseline correlational analyses demonstrated a moderate positive relationship between compulsive exercise and ED psychopathology, and a weak positive relationship between compulsive exercise and psychological distress. There was a moderate negative relationship between compulsive exercise and eating disorder QoL.


Conclusions
These results indicate compulsive exercise is moderately associated with poorer QoL and weakly associated with higher distress. Targeting compulsive exercise in the treatment of anorexia nervosa may help reduce the burden of illness and improve patients' engagement in treatment.

289,The dynamic behavior of a nematic liquid crystal with added carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in an electric field was analyzed. A theoretical model based on elastic continuum theory was developed and the relaxation times of nematic liquid crystals with CNTs were evaluated. Experiments made with single-walled carbon nanotubes dispersed in nematic 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) indicated a significant difference of the relaxation time when compared to pure liquid crystal. We also noticed that the relaxation time when the field is switched off depends on how long the field was applied. It is shorter when the field is switched off immediately after application and longer when the field was applied for at least one hour.,29441268,2018,Dynamic behavior of a nematic liquid crystal with added carbon nanotubes in an electric field.
290,"The behavior of nanoparticles under nanofluidic confinement depends strongly on their distance to the confining walls; however, a measurement in which the gap distance is varied is challenging. Here, we present a versatile setup for investigating the behavior of nanoparticles as a function of the gap distance, which is controlled to the nanometer. The setup is designed as an open system that operates with a small amount of dispersion of ≈20 μL, permits the use of coated and patterned samples and allows high-numerical-aperture microscopy access. Using the tool, we measure the vertical position (termed height) and the lateral diffusion of 60 nm, charged, Au nanospheres as a function of confinement between a glass surface and a polymer surface. Interferometric scattering detection provides an effective particle illumination time of less than 30 μs, which results in lateral and vertical position detection accuracy ≈10 nm for diffusing particles. We found the height of the particles to be consistently above that of the gap center, corresponding to a higher charge on the polymer substrate. In terms of diffusion, we found a strong monotonic decay of the diffusion constant with decreasing gap distance. This result cannot be explained by hydrodynamic effects, including the asymmetric vertical position of the particles in the gap. Instead we attribute it to an electroviscous effect. For strong confinement of less than 120 nm gap distance, we detect the onset of subdiffusion, which can be correlated to the motion of the particles along high-gap-distance paths.",29441273,2018,The nanofluidic confinement apparatus: studying confinement-dependent nanoparticle behavior and diffusion.

In children and adolescents who might benefit from use of medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drugs of choice. The safety and efficacy of medications other than SSRIs in the treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders are not fully established. Most children and adolescents respond well to treatment with long lasting resolution of symptoms, although, recurrence of the same, or development of a different type of anxiety disorder, is not uncommon.

Psoriasis is one of the most common skin disorders with a prevalence rate of 0.1%-3%. Chronic nature, frequent relapses, absence of permanent cure, and the cosmetic disfigurement of psoriasis have a negative impact on quality of life (QoL) by causing psychological stress. Patients with psoriasis often have unambiguous ideas about the causes, controllability, consequences, and expected time-course of their disease.


Aim
The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a video-assisted teaching program regarding psoriasis on the level of knowledge and relaxation therapy on QoL among patients with psoriasis.


Materials and Methods
Experimental design was adapted. One hundred and four participants diagnosed with psoriasis were randomly allocated either to an experimental or to a control group. Fifty-two participants were included in each group by simple random sampling. A video-assisted teaching program on psoriasis and relaxation exercises was taught to the participants over a period of 3 months. The tools used were: Psoriasis Knowledge Assessment Questionnaire, modified psoriasis disability index, and modified psoriasis life stress inventory.


Results
In the experimental group, the knowledge score was increased significantly from 9 ± 2.2 at baseline to 23.6 ± 1.5 after the intervention. The disability score was decreased from 15.6 to 9.9 and the stress score related to the illness was decreased from 22.8 to 16.9 after the intervention.

294,"Self-aggregating calix[4]arenes carrying four DOTA ligands on the upper rim for stable complexation of paramagnetic GdIII-ions have already been proposed as MRI probes. In this work, we investigate the luminescence properties of TbIII-DOTA-calix[4]arene-4OPr containing four propyl-groups and compare them with those of the analog substituted with a phthalimide chromophore (TbIII-DOTA-calix[4]arene-3OPr-OPhth). We show that, given its four aromatic rings, the calix[4]arene core acts as an effective sensitizer of Tb-centered luminescence. Substituents on the lower rim can modulate the aggregation behavior, which in turn determines the luminescence properties of the compounds. In solid state, the quantum yield of the phthalimide derivative is almost three times as high as that of the propyl-functionalized analog demonstrating a beneficial role of the chromophore on Tb-luminescence. In solution, however, the effect of the phthalimide group vanishes, which we attribute to the large distance between the chromophore and the lanthanide, situated on the opposite rims of the calix[4]arene. Both quantum yields and luminescence lifetimes show clear concentration dependence in solution, related to the strong impact of aggregation on the luminescence behavior. We also evidence the variability in the values of the critical micelle concentration depending on the experimental technique. Such luminescent calix[4]arene platforms accommodating stable lanthanide complexes can be considered valuable building blocks for the design of dual MR/optical imaging probes.",29441345,2018,Luminescence Properties of Self-Aggregating TbIII-DOTA-Functionalized Calix[4]arenes.
295,"Social foraging theory suggests that group-living animals gain from persistent social bonds, which lead to increased tolerance in competitive foraging and information sharing. Bats are among the most social mammals, often living in colonies of tens to thousands of individuals for dozens of years, yet little is known about their social foraging dynamics. We observed three captive bat colonies for over a year, quantifying >13,000 social foraging interactions. We found that individuals consistently used one of two foraging strategies, either producing (collecting) food themselves or scrounging it directly from the mouth of other individuals. Individual foraging types were consistent over at least 16 months except during the lactation period when females shifted toward producing. Scroungers intentionally selected whom to interact with when socially foraging, thus generating persistent nonrandom social relationships with two to three specific producers. These persistent producer-scrounger relationships seem to reduce aggression over time. Finally, scrounging was highly correlated with vigilance, and we hypothesize that vigilant-prone individuals turn to scrounging in the wild to mitigate the risk of landing on a potentially unsafe fruit tree. We find the bat colony to be a rich and dynamic social system, which can serve as a model to study the role that social foraging plays in the evolution of mammalian sociality. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual tendencies when exploring social behavior patterns of group-living animals. These tendencies further emphasize the necessity of studying social networks over time.",29441356,2018,Persistent producer-scrounger relationships in bats.

In the context of speech, existing data suggest an interaction between auditory and speech-motor cortices, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. We fill a basic gap in our understanding of the sensorimotor processing of speech by examining the synchronization between auditory and speech-motor regions over different speech rates, a fundamental parameter delimiting successful perception. First, using magnetoencephalography, we measure synchronization between auditory and speech-motor regions while participants listen to syllables at various rates. We show, surprisingly, that auditory-motor synchrony is significant only over a restricted range and is enhanced at ~4.5 Hz, a value compatible with the mean syllable rate across languages. Second, neural modeling reveals that this modulated coupling plausibly emerges as a consequence of the underlying neural architecture.

The sites of the tyrosine kinase gene mutations are associated with the biological behavior of GISTs, including risk category, clinical outcome and drug response. Mutations in RAS signaling pathway genes, including KRAS and BRAF, have also been reported in KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GISTs, though they are rare. Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in neurofibromatosis type 1. Patients with NF1 mutations are at high risk of developing GISTs. Recent findings suggest that altered expression or mutation of members of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) heterotetramer are causally associated with GIST development through induction of aberrant DNA methylation. At present, GISTs with no alterations in KIT, PDGFRA, RAS signaling genes or SDH family genes are referred to as true wild-type GISTs. KIT and PDGFRA mutations are thought as the earliest events in GIST development, and subsequent accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and other molecular alterations are required for malignant progression.

This study was designed to examine the variability in timing of peak weight loss in behavioral treatment (BT), that is, when treatment participants reach their greatest amount of cumulative weight loss.


METHODS
Secondary data analyses were conducted, drawing upon data from two clinical trials that provided 12 months of group-based BT, with sessions meeting less frequently in the second half of the treatment year. Weight was measured at the beginning of each treatment session.


RESULTS
Cumulative proportions of participants reaching peak weight loss were as follows: 25.0% of study 1 and 20.0% of study 2 participants by month 4; 43.2% of study 1 and 52.2% of study 2 participants by month 6; 54.5% of study 1 and 77.8% of study 2 participants by month 8. Among participants who peaked after 4 months, the mean amount of additional weight loss achieved between 4 months and the peak session was 4.74 kg in study 1 and 4.07 kg in study 2.

300,"Since it was first associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) in a 2011 genome-wide association study (GWAS), there have been over 100 publications focused on MIR137, the gene encoding microRNA-137. These studies have examined everything from its fundamental role in the development of mice, flies, and fish to the intriguing enrichment of its target gene network in SCZ. Indeed, much of the excitement surrounding MIR137 is due to the distinct possibility that it could regulate a gene network involved in SCZ etiology, a disease which we now recognize is highly polygenic. Here we comprehensively review, to the best of our ability, all published genetic and biological evidence that could support or refute a role for MIR137 in the etiology of SCZ. Through a careful consideration of the literature, we conclude that the data gathered to date continues to strongly support the involvement of MIR137 and its target gene network in neuropsychiatric traits, including SCZ risk. There remain, however, more unanswered than answered questions regarding the mechanisms linking MIR137 genetic variation with behavior. These questions need answers before we can determine whether there are opportunities for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions based on MIR137.

They are confirmation bias (selective gathering of and neglect of contradictory evidence); base rate bias (ignoring or misusing prevailing base rate data); hindsight bias (oversimplification of past causation); and good old days bias (the tendency for patients to misremember and exaggerate their preinjury functioning).

302,"BACKGROUND
Three billion people use solid cooking fuels, and 4 million people die from household air pollution annually. Shifting households to clean fuels, like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), may protect health only if stoves are consistently used. Few studies have used an implementation science framework to systematically assess ""de-implementation"" of traditional stoves, and none have done so with pregnant women who are more likely to adopt new behaviors. We evaluated an introduced LPG stove coupled with a phased behavioral intervention to encourage exclusive gas stove use among pregnant women in rural Guatemala.


METHODS
We enrolled 50 women at < 20 weeks gestation in this prospective cohort study. All women received a free 3-burner LPG stove and ten tank refills. We conducted formative research using COM-B Model and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). This included thematic analysis of focus group findings and classes delivered to 25 pregnant women (Phase 1). In Phase 2, we complemented classes with a home-based tailored behavioral intervention with a different group of 25 pregnant women. We mapped 35 TDF constructs onto survey questions. To evaluate stove use, we placed temperature sensors on wood and gas stoves and estimated fraction of stove use three times during pregnancy and twice during the first month after infant birth.


RESULTS
Class attendance rates were above 92%. We discussed feasible ways to reduce HAP exposure, proper stove use, maintenance and safety. We addressed food preferences, ease of cooking and time savings through cooking demonstrations. In Phase 2, the COM-B framework revealed that other household members needed to be involved if the gas stove was to be consistently used. Social identity and empowerment were key in decisions about stove repairs and LPG tank refills. The seven intervention functions included training, education, persuasion, incentivization, modelling, enablement and environmental restructuring. Wood stove use dropped upon introduction of the gas stove from 6.4 h to 1.9 h.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study using the COM-B Model to develop a behavioral intervention that promotes household-level sustained use of LPG stoves. This study lays the groundwork for a future LPG stove intervention trial coupled with a behavioral change intervention.

303,"BACKGROUND
While increasing cigarette taxes has been a major policy driver to decrease smoking, taxes on other tobacco products have received less attention. Our aims were to evaluate the impact of chewing tobacco/cigar taxes, cigarette taxes, and smoke-free legislation on adolescent male and female use of smokeless tobacco and cigars.


METHODS
We analyzed data on 499,381 adolescents age 14-18 years from 36 US states in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (1999-2013) linked to state-level tobacco control policies. We conducted difference-in-differences regression models to assess whether changes in taxes and the enactment of smoke-free legislation were associated with smokeless tobacco use and, separately, cigar use. Models were stratified by adolescent sex.


RESULTS
We found that chewing tobacco taxes had no effect on smokeless tobacco use and cigar taxes had no effect on cigar use. In contrast, among males a 10% increase in cigarette taxes was associated with a 1.0 percentage point increase (0.0010, 95% CI 0.0003-0.0017) in smokeless tobacco use. A 10% increase in cigarette taxes was also associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase (0.0015, 95% CI 0.0006-0.0024) in cigar use among males and a 0.7 percentage point increase (0.0007, 95% CI 0.0001-0.0013) in cigar use among females. There was some evidence that smoke-free legislation was associated with an 1.1 percentage point increase (0.0105, 95% CI 0.0015-0.0194) in smokeless tobacco use among males only, but no effect of smoke-free legislation on cigar use for males or females.


CONCLUSIONS
Higher state cigarette taxes are associated with adolescents' use of cheaper, alternative tobacco products such as smokeless tobacco and cigars. Reducing tobacco use will require comprehensive tobacco control policies that are applied equally to and inclusive of all tobacco products.",29444658,2018,Impact of tobacco control policies on adolescent smokeless tobacco and cigar use: a difference-in-differences approach.
304,"BACKGROUND
Many Community Health Workers (CHWs) experience the same socioeconomic and health needs as their neighbors, given that they are by definition part of their communities. Yet very few studies aim to measure and characterize experiences of deprivation, poverty, and wellbeing among community health workers. This study quantitatively examines deprivation and wellbeing in Ethiopia's Women's Development Army (WDA), a massive unpaid community health workforce intended to improve population health and modernize the country.


METHODS
We conducted a survey of 422 volunteer WDA leaders and community members in rural Amhara state, part of a mixed-methods ethnographic study of the experiences of women in the WDA. The survey asked a variety of questions about respondents' demographics, education, assets, and access to government services. We also used survey measures to evaluate respondents' levels of household food and water security, stressful life events, social support, work burden, and psychological distress.


RESULTS
Volunteer WDA leaders and community members alike tend to have very low levels of schooling and household assets, and to be heavily burdened with daily work in several domains. Large proportions are food and water insecure, many are in debt, and many experience stretches of time with no money at all. Our survey also revealed differences between volunteer WDA leaders and other women that warrant attention. Leaders are less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced or separated. Leaders are also more likely to experience some aspects of food insecurity and report greater levels of psychological distress and more stressful life events. They also report slightly less social support than other women.


CONCLUSIONS
In rural Amhara, women who seek out and/or are sought and recruited for leader roles in the WDA are a population living in precarity. In several domains, they experience even more hardship than their neighbors. These findings highlight a need for careful attention and further research into processes of volunteer CHW selection, and to determine whether or not volunteering for CHW programs increases socioeconomic and health risks among volunteers. CHW programs in settings of poverty should stop using unpaid labor and seek to create more paid CHW jobs.",29444660,2018,Volunteers in Ethiopia's women's development army are more deprived and distressed than their neighbors: cross-sectional survey data from rural Ethiopia.
305,"BACKGROUND
Obesity during adolescence is associated with cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. The adverse obesity-related cardiometabolic risk profile is already observed in adolescence. We aimed to examine possible gender differences in cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle behaviors among adolescents with severe obesity, hypothesizing that boys would have both a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome as well as less healthy lifestyle behaviors than girls.


METHODS
Cross-sectional study of treatment-seeking adolescents with severe obesity who attended the Morbid Obesity Centre at Vestfold Hospital Trust and who were consecutively enrolled in the Vestfold Register of Obese Children between September 2009 and September 2015. A total of 313 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years were recruited, whereof 268 subjects (49% boys) completed a food and activity frequency questionnaire and were included in the analysis.


RESULTS
Mean (SD) age, BMI and BMI SDS were 15 (1.6) years, 38.6 (5.9) kg/m2 and 3.5 (0.6). Levels of LDL cholesterol, fasting insulin and glucose and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not differ between genders. Compared to girls, boys had significantly higher triglycerides (p = 0.037) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.003), as well as lower HDL cholesterol (p = 0.002). The metabolic syndrome was present in 27% of the boys and 19% of the girls (p = 0.140), and the prevalence of high DBP, dyslipidemia and dysglycemia also did not differ significantly between genders. The prevalence of high SBP was higher in boys than in girls (19% vs. 9%, p = 0.021). Gender was associated with a number of lifestyle habits, as a larger proportions of boys had higher screen time (p = 0.032), more regular breakfast eating (p = 0.023), higher intake of sugar sweetened soda (p = 0.036), and lower intake of vegetables than girls (p = 0.011). By contrast, physical activity level and intake of fruit and berries did not differ between genders.


CONCLUSIONS
Male treatment-seeking adolescents with severe obesity had a more unfavorable set of metabolic and behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease than girls. Our results indicate that lifestyle behavioral markers should be thoroughly assessed in both genders, and possible gender-related differences in risk profile should be taken into account in future treatment programs.",29444663,2018,Gender-related differences in cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle behaviors in treatment-seeking adolescents with severe obesity.
306,"BACKGROUND
Lack of information on the HIV epidemic among men who inject drugs (MWID) in northwestern Vietnam, a remote area, may hamper national efforts to control the disease. We examined HIV prevalence, needle-syringe sharing behaviors, and associated factors among MWID in three areas of northwestern Vietnam.


METHODS
We used descriptive analysis to report the characteristics, frequency of risk behaviors, and of access to healthcare services among the MWID. Univariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between the HIV infection, needle-syringe sharing behaviors, and their independent variables. We further explored these associations in multivariable analyses where we included independent variables based on a priori knowledge and their associations with the dependent variables determined in univariable analyses (p <  0.25).


RESULTS
The HIV prevalence was 37.9, 16.9, and 18.5% for Tuan Giao, Bat Xat, and Lao Cai City, respectively, and 25.4% overall. MWID of Thai minority ethnicity were more likely to be HIV-positive (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-6.87). The rate of needle-syringe sharing in the previous 6 months was approximately 9% among the MWID in Tuan Giao and Lao Cai City, and 27.8% in Bat Xat. Two thirds of the participants never underwent HIV testing before this study. Ever having been tested for HIV before this study was not associated with any needle-syringe sharing behaviors. Among the HIV-positive MWID, those who received free clean needles and syringes were less likely to give used needles and syringes to peers (AOR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06-0.79). Going to a ""hotspot"" in the previous week was associated with increased odds of needle-syringe sharing in multiple subgroups.


CONCLUSION
Our findings on HIV prevalence and testing participation among a subset of MWID in the northwestern Vietnam were corroborated with trend analysis results from the most recent HIV/STI Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance report (data last collected in 2013.) We provided important insights into these MWID's risky injection behaviors. We suggest heightened emphasis on HIV testing and needle and syringe provision for this population. Also, policymakers and program implementers should target hotspots as a main venue to tackle HIV epidemics.",29444685,2018,Prevalence and correlates of HIV infection among men who inject drugs in a remote area of Vietnam.

We investigated the benefits of a cognitive behavior therapy-based exercise program to reduce the dry eye symptoms of office workers.


Materials and methods
We recruited 11 office workers with dry eye symptoms, aged 31-64 years, who voluntarily participated in group health guidance at a manufacturing company. Participants learned about the role of physical activity and exercise in enhancing wellness and performed an exercise program at home 3 days per week for 10 weeks. We estimated the indexes of body composition, dry eye symptoms, and psychological distress using the Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life Score and the World Health Organization's Subjective Well-Being Inventory questionnaires pre- and postintervention.


Results
The 10-week exercise program and the questionnaires were completed by 48.1% (39 of 81) of the participants. Body composition did not change pre- and postintervention. However, the average of the Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life Score scores in participants with subjective dry eye significantly improved after the intervention. Moreover, the World Health Organization's Subjective Well-Being Inventory positive well-being score tended to increase after the intervention.


Conclusion
In this study, we showed that a 10-week exercise program improved subjective dry eye symptoms of healthy office workers. Our study suggests that a cognitive behavior therapy-based exercise program can play an important role in the treatment of patients with dry eye disease.",29445264,2018,Exercise program improved subjective dry eye symptoms for office workers.
308,"Background
COPD is a globally significant public health problem and is the second leading cause of mortality. This study presents the health burden of COPD in Nepal using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2016 dataset.


Methods
This study used the data from the GBD repository presenting morbidity and mortality attributed to COPD, by sex and age. In GBD 2016, due to a lack of the primary source of data in Nepal, estimations on morbidity and mortality of COPD were based on its predictive covariates. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated based on the cause of death estimations, applying GBD's Cause of Death Ensemble modeling. Likewise, years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying the prevalence of each sequela by the disability weight. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were derived as the sum of YLLs and YLDs.


Results
Between 1990 and 2016, the estimated age-standardized mortality rate due to COPD was decreasing for both genders, but the decline was much higher among males. Unlike the high rate of incidence among males, the age-standardized DALYs were found to be high among females (2,274.9 [95% UI: 1,702.0-2,881.5] per 100,000). YLLs contributed around 80% of DALYs due to COPD in 2016. Age-standardized YLLs rate was higher among females, with a value of 1,860 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1,282.8-2,472.8) vs 1,547.6 (95% UI: 992.1-2,018.5) among the males per 100,000 population.


Conclusion
The prevalence and incidence of COPD remained almost stationary over the years, but still very high. Though the incidence and prevalence of disease were high among males, the death rate and DALYs were more significant among females throughout the years. If the current situation prevails, the burden of COPD will continue to increase in the country. Hence, comprehensive social, environmental, and behavioral approaches to curtail the risk factors along with early identification, treatment, and management of COPD is of utmost importance.",29445275,2018,Burden of COPD in Nepal.
309,"Introduction
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery systems. This interest is mainly attributed to the ease of their surface functionalization for drug loading. In orthopedic applications, gentamicin-loaded SiO2 NPs (nanohybrids) are frequently utilized for their prolonged antibacterial effects. Therefore, the possible adverse effects of SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids on osteogenesis of bone-related cells should be thoroughly investigated to ensure safe applications.


Materials and methods
The effects of SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids on the cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells were investigated, together with native SiO2 NPs and free gentamicin.


Results
The results of Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay show that both SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids and native SiO2 NPs reduce cell viability of SaOS-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Regarding osteogenesis, SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids and native SiO2 NPs at the concentration range of 31.25-125 μg/mL do not influence the osteogenic differentiation capacity of SaOS-2 cells. At a high concentration (250 μg/mL), both materials induce a lower expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) but an enhanced mineralization. Free gentamicin at concentrations of 6.26 and 9.65 μg/mL does not significantly influence the cell viability and osteogenic differentiation capacity of SaOS-2 cells.


Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that both SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids and SiO2 NPs show cytotoxic effects to SaOS-2 cells. Further investigation on the effects of SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids on the behaviors of stem cells or other regular osteoblasts should be conducted to make a full evaluation of the safety of SiO2-gentamicin nanohybrids in orthopedic applications.",29445277,2018,Effects of silica-gentamicin nanohybrids on osteogenic differentiation of human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells.
310,"Background
Alarming somatic symptoms, in particular, cardiovascular symptoms, are the characteristic feature of panic attacks. Increased cardiac mortality and morbidity have been found in these patients. Power spectral analysis of electrocardiogram R-R intervals is known to be a particularly successful tool in the detection of autonomic instabilities in various clinical disorders. Our study aimed to compare patients with panic disorder and healthy controls in heart rate variation (HRV) parameters (very-low-frequency [VLF], low-frequency [LF], and high-frequency [HF] band components of R-R interval) in baseline and during the response to the mental task.


Subjects and methods
We assessed psychophysiological variables in 33 patients with panic disorder (10 men, 23 women; mean age 35.9±10.7 years) and 33 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (10 men, 23 women; mean age 35.8±12.1 years). Patients were treatment naïve. Heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and HRV in basal conditions and after the psychological task were assessed. Power spectrum was computed for VLF (0.003-0.04 Hz), LF (0.04-0.15 Hz), and HF (0.15-0.40 Hz) bands using fast Fourier transformation.


Results
In the baseline period, the VLF band was significantly lower in panic disorder group compared to controls (p<0.005). In the period of mental task, the LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in panic disorder patients compared to controls (p<0.05). No significant differences were found in the remaining parameters. There was a significant difference in ΔHF and ΔLF/HF ratio between patients and controls, with Δ increasing in patients and decreasing in controls.


Conclusion
These findings revealed that patients suffering from panic disorder were characterized by relative sympathetic dominance (reactivity) in response to mental stress compared with healthy controls.",29445280,2018,The differences between patients with panic disorder and healthy controls in psychophysiological stress profile.
311,"Purpose
The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk of suicidal drug overdose (SDO) after stroke in older patients.


Methods
We enrolled patients aged 60-99 years who were diagnosed with new-onset stroke between 2002 and 2013 and age-, sex-, and index-year-matched controls who did not have stroke. Patients with a history of SDO before enrollment were excluded. Both groups were observed until December 31, 2013. The primary end point was the occurrence of newly diagnosed SDO. The cumulative incidence rates of the study and control groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Furthermore, we used the Cox proportional hazards model to identify risk factors for SDO.


Results
We selected 22,770 individuals. Among them, 11,385 were older patients (aged 60-99 years) who had newly diagnosed stroke and 11,385 were controls. Of the 22,770 individuals, 275 (1.21%) had SDO during a mean follow-up period of 5.33±3.30 years, comprising 191 (1.68%) from the stroke group and 84 (0.74%) from the control group. Older patients with stroke had a significantly higher risk of SDO than the controls (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.288, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.746-2.999, p<0.001). Moreover, in older patients with stroke, the risk significantly increased with the number of stroke events. Patients with depressive disorder or coronary disease had an increased risk of SDO. Additionally, benzodiazepines and anticoagulants were the two most commonly prescribed medications for SDO.


Conclusion
Clinicians should be aware of the risk of SDO and risk factors in older patients with stroke.

312,"Background and objectives
Patients who come for a consultation at a general practice clinic as outpatients often suffer from background anxiety and depression. The psychological state of such patients can alleviate naturally; however, there are cases when these symptoms persist. This study investigated the realities and factors behind anxiety/depression becoming prolonged.


Methods
Participants were 678 adult patients, who came to Department of General Medicine at Chiba University Hospital within a 1-year period starting from April 2012 and who completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during their initial consultation. Participants whose Anxiety or Depression scores in the HADS, or both, were 8 points or higher were defined as being within the anxiety/depression group, with all other participants making up the control group. A telephone interview was also conducted with participants. Furthermore, age, sex, the period from the onset of symptoms to the initial consultation at our department, the period from the initial department consultation to the telephone survey, and the existence of mental illness at the final department diagnosis were investigated.


Results
A total of 121 patients (17.8% response rate) agreed to the phone survey. The HADS score during the phone survey showed that the anxiety/depression group had a significantly higher score than the control group. The HADS scores obtained between the initial consultation and telephone survey showed a positive correlation. Logistic regression analysis extracted ""age"" and the ""continuation of the symptoms during the initial consultation"" as factors that prolonged anxiety/depression.


Conclusion
Anxiety and depression in general practice outpatients have the possibility of becoming prolonged for an extended period of time. Being aged 65 years or over and showing a continuation of symptoms past the initial consultation are the strongest factors associated with these prolonged conditions. When patients with anxiety and depression exhibit these risk factors, they should be further evaluated for treatment.",29445294,2018,Anxiety and depression in general practice outpatients: the long-term change process.
313,"A substantial number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with 26% experiencing severe symptoms that impact daytime functioning, qualifying them for a diagnosis of insomnia. Here, we review both self-report and polysomnographic evidence for sleep difficulties in the context of the menopausal transition, considering severity of sleep complaints and links between hot flashes (HFs) and depression with poor sleep. Longitudinal population-based studies show that sleep difficulties are uniquely linked with menopausal stage and changes in follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol, over and above the effects of age. A major contributor to sleep complaints in the context of the menopausal transition is HFs, and many, although not all, HFs are linked with polysomnographic-defined awakenings, with HF-associated wake time contributing significantly to overall wakefulness after sleep onset. Some sleep complaints may be comorbid with depressive disorders or attributed to sleep-related breathing or movement disorders, which increase in prevalence especially after menopause, and for some women, menopause, age, and environmental/behavioral factors may interact to disrupt sleep. Considering the unique and multifactorial basis for sleep difficulties in women transitioning menopause, we describe clinical assessment approaches and management options, including combination treatments, ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia to hormonal and nonhormonal pharmacological options. Emerging studies suggest that the impact of severe insomnia symptoms could extend beyond immediate health care usage and quality of life issues to long-term mental and physical health, if left untreated in midlife women. Appropriate treatment, therefore, has immediate benefit as well as advantages for maintaining optimal health in the postmenopausal years.",29445307,2018,"Sleep problems during the menopausal transition: prevalence, impact, and management challenges."

Nanostructured PCMs are considered as the next generation building blocks for their low power consumption, high storage density, and fast switching speed. Yet their crystallization kinetics at high temperature, the rate-limiting property upon switching, faces great challenges due to the short time and length scales involved. Here we present a facile method to synthesize highly controlled, ligand-free GeTe nanoparticles, an important PCM, with an average diameter under 10 nm. Subsequent crystallization by slow and ultrafast rates allows unravelling of the crystallization kinetics, demonstrating the breakdown of Arrhenius behavior for the crystallization rate and a fragile-to-strong transition in the viscosity as well as the overall crystal growth rate for the as-deposited GeTe nanoparticles.

315,"Inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) are pentameric ligand-gated anion channels with major roles in startle disease/hyperekplexia (GlyR α1), cortical neuronal migration/autism spectrum disorder (GlyR α2), and inflammatory pain sensitization/rhythmic breathing (GlyR α3). However, the role of the GlyR α4 subunit has remained enigmatic, because the corresponding human gene (GLRA4) is thought to be a pseudogene due to an in-frame stop codon at position 390 within the fourth membrane-spanning domain (M4). Despite this, a recent genetic study has implicated GLRA4 in intellectual disability, behavioral problems and craniofacial anomalies. Analyzing data from sequenced genomes, we found that GlyR α4 subunit genes are predicted to be intact and functional in the majority of vertebrate species-with the exception of humans. Cloning of human GlyR α4 cDNAs excluded alternative splicing and RNA editing as mechanisms for restoring a full-length GlyR α4 subunit. Moreover, artificial restoration of the missing conserved arginine (R390) in the human cDNA was not sufficient to restore GlyR α4 function. Further bioinformatic and mutagenesis analysis revealed an additional damaging substitution at K59 that ablates human GlyR α4 function, which is not present in other vertebrate GlyR α4 sequences. The substitutions K59 and X390 were also present in the genome of an ancient Denisovan individual, indicating that GLRA4 has been a pseudogene for at least 30,000-50,000 years. In artificial synapses, we found that both mouse and gorilla α4β GlyRs mediate synaptic currents with unusually slow decay kinetics. Lastly, to gain insights into the biological role of GlyR α4 function, we studied the duplicated genes glra4a and glra4b in zebrafish. While glra4b expression is restricted to the retina, using a novel tol2-GAL4FF gene trap line (SAIGFF16B), we found that the zebrafish GlyR α4a subunit gene (glra4a) is strongly expressed in spinal cord and hindbrain commissural neurones. Using gene knockdown and a dominant-negative GlyR α4aR278Q mutant, we found that GlyR α4a contributes to touch-evoked escape behaviors in zebrafish. Thus, although GlyR α4 is unlikely to be involved in human startle responses or disease states, this subtype may contribute to escape behaviors in other organisms.",29445326,2018,Structure/Function Studies of the α4 Subunit Reveal Evolutionary Loss of a GlyR Subtype Involved in Startle and Escape Responses.
316,"Objective: It could be demonstrated that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) enhances accuracy in working memory tasks and reaction time in healthy adults and thus may also have an influence on complex everyday tasks like driving a car. However, no studies have applied tDCS to psychomotor skills related to a standard driving test so far. Methods: 10 female and 5 male healthy adults without any medication and history of psychiatric or neurological illness were randomly assigned to two groups receiving active and sham stimulation in a double blind, cross-over study design. Standardized computerized psychomotor tests according to the German guidelines for road and traffic safety were administered at baseline. Then they performed the same tests during an anodal or sham tDCS of the left DLPFC in two separated sessions. Results: No significant improvements in skills related to driving performance like visual perception, stress tolerance, concentration, and vigilance could be shown after left anodal prefrontal tDCS. Side effects were low and did not differ between active and sham stimulation. Conclusions: The findings of our study indicate that left prefrontal tDCS may not alter driving skills affording more automated action patterns but as shown in previous studies may have an influence on driving behavior requiring executive control processes. This however has to be proved in future studies and within greater samples.",29445329,2018,The Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Psychomotor and Visual Perception Functions Related to Driving Skills.
317,"A large body of research has shown superior learning rates in variable practice compared to repetitive practice. More specifically, this has been demonstrated in the contextual interference (CI) and in the differential learning (DL) approach that are both representatives of variable practice. Behavioral studies have indicate different learning processes in CI and DL. Aim of the present study was to examine immediate post-task effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activation patterns after CI and DL protocols that reveal underlying neural processes at the early stage of motor consolidation. Additionally, we tested two DL protocols (gradual DL, chaotic DL) to examine the effect of different degrees of stochastic fluctuations within the DL approach with a low degree of fluctuations in gradual DL and a high degree of fluctuations in chaotic DL. Twenty-two subjects performed badminton serves according to three variable practice protocols (CI, gradual DL, chaotic DL), and a repetitive learning protocol in a within-subjects design. Spontaneous EEG activity was measured before, and immediately after each 20-min practice session from 19 electrodes. Results showed distinguishable neural processes after CI, DL, and repetitive learning. Increases in EEG theta and alpha power were obtained in somatosensory regions (electrodes P3, P7, Pz, P4, P8) in both DL conditions compared to CI, and repetitive learning. Increases in theta and alpha activity in motor areas (electrodes C3, Cz, C4) were found after chaotic DL compared to gradual DL, and CI. Anterior areas (electrodes F3, F7, Fz, F4, F8) showed increased activity in the beta and gamma bands after CI. Alpha activity was increased in occipital areas (electrodes O1, O2) after repetitive learning. Post-task EEG brain activation patterns suggest that DL stimulates the somatosensory and motor system, and engages more regions of the cortex than repetitive learning due to a tighter stimulation of the motor and somatosensory system during DL practice. CI seems to activate specifically executively controlled processing in anterior brain areas. We discuss the obtained patterns of post-training EEG traces as evidence for different underlying neural processes in CI, DL, and repetitive learning at the early stage of motor learning.",29445334,2018,Post-task Effects on EEG Brain Activity Differ for Various Differential Learning and Contextual Interference Protocols.
318,"The monitoring of cognitive functions is central to the assessment and consecutive management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Though, especially cognitive processes that are central to everyday behavior like dual-tasking are often neglected. We examined dual-task performance using a psychological-refractory period (PRP) task in N = 21 patients and healthy controls and conducted standard neuropsychological tests. In dual-tasking, MS patients committed more erroneous responses when dual-tasking was difficult. In easier conditions, performance of MS patients did not differ to controls. Interestingly, the response times were generally not affected by the difficulty of the dual task, showing that the deficits observed do not reflect simple motor deficits or deficits in information processing speed but point out deficits in executive control functions and response selection in particular. Effect sizes were considerably large with d∼0.80 in mild affected patients and the achieved power was above 99%. There are cognitive control and dual tasking deficits in MS that are not attributable to simple motor speed deficits. Scaling of the difficulty of dual-tasking makes the test applied suitable for a wide variety of MS-patients and may complement neuropsychological assessments in clinical care and research setting.",29445335,2018,Dual-Tasking in Multiple Sclerosis - Implications for a Cognitive Screening Instrument.
319,"Introduction: Being in an intimate relationship with a person with multiple sclerosis (MS) may have a substantial impact on the partner's quality of life. Existing research has largely focused on negative impacts of MS for both people with MS (PwMS) and their partners and has sampled the population of partners of PwMS who have primarily adopted standard medical management only. Modifiable lifestyle factors have become increasingly recognized in the management of MS symptoms and disease progression. For partners of PwMS who have undertaken lifestyle modification as an additional strategy to minimize disease progression, the impacts, both positive and negative remain unexplored. This research is unique as it focuses on partners of PwMS who have attempted to adopt major lifestyle interventions outside of the prevailing paradigm of MS management. Aim: To explore and interpret the lived experiences of partners of PwMS who have adopted lifestyle modification, to understand partners' attitudes to and experiences of the effect of MS and lifestyle modification on their life, relationship and view of the future. Method: Design: a qualitative, interpretive, phenomenological study using semi-structured interviews.


PARTICIPANTS
English-speaking; aged 18 years or more; in a spousal relationship for 12 months or more with a person with MS who had attended a residential lifestyle educational intervention and undertaken lifestyle modification.


ANALYSIS
Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using NVivo™ software. Results: Twenty-one partners were interviewed. This paper reports one of the study's themes, the psychological shift experienced by partners of PwMS. Sub-themes included adaptation; loss and grief; difficult emotions; reframing, re-evaluating and re-prioritizing; hope and optimism; empowerment and taking control; and self-awareness, greater understanding and personal growth. Conclusion: Partners of PwMS who have undertaken lifestyle modification experienced a broad range of psychological adjustments. Whilst reflecting the potential difficulties that partners of PwMS may experience, this group experienced a range of positive psychological changes that add to the literature regarding partners' potential experiences and may provide hope for those in partnerships with people with MS. This study provides themes to potentially inform a quantitative study of a larger population of partners of PwMS.",29445346,2018,Psychological Shift in Partners of People with Multiple Sclerosis Who Undertake Lifestyle Modification: An Interpretive Phenomenological Study.
320,"Enhancing practice design is critical to facilitate transfer of learning. Considerable research has focused on the role of perceptual information in practice simulation, yet has neglected how affect and cognition are shaped by practice environments and whether this influences the fidelity of behavior (Headrick et al., 2015). This study filled this gap by examining the fidelity of individual (cognition, affect, and actions) and interpersonal behavior of 10 highly skilled Australian Taekwondo athletes fighting in training compared to competition. Interpersonal behavior was assessed by tracking location coordinates to analyze distance-time coordination tendencies of the fighter-fighter system. Individual actions were assessed through notational analysis and approximate entropy calculations of coordinate data to quantify the (un)predictability of movement displacement. Affect and cognition were assessed with mixed-methods that included perceptual scales measuring anxiety, arousal, and mental effort, and post-fight video-facilitated confrontational interviews to explore how affect and cognitions might differ. Quantitative differences were assessed with mixed models and dependent t-tests. Results reveal that individual and interpersonal behavior differed between training and competition. In training, individuals attacked less (d = 0.81, p < 0.05), initiated attacks from further away (d = -0.20, p < 0.05) and displayed more predictable movement trajectories (d = 0.84, p < 0.05). In training, fighters had lower anxiety (d = -1.26, p < 0.05), arousal (d = -1.07, p < 0.05), and mental effort (d = -0.77, p < 0.05). These results were accompanied by changes in interpersonal behavior, with larger interpersonal distances generated by the fighter-fighter system in training (d = 0.80, p < 0.05). Qualitative data revealed the emergence of cognitions and affect specific to the training environment, such as reductions in pressure, arousal, and mental challenge. Findings highlight the specificity of performer-environment interactions. Fighting in training affords reduced affective and cognitive demands and a decrease in action fidelity compared to competition. In addition to sampling information, representative practice needs to consider modeling the cognitions and affect of competition to enhance transfer.",29445348,2018,Taekwondo Fighting in Training Does Not Simulate the Affective and Cognitive Demands of Competition: Implications for Behavior and Transfer.

322,"Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) spontaneously emit individual acoustic signals that identify them to group members. We tested whether these cetaceans could learn artificial individual sound cues played underwater and whether they would generalize this learning to airborne sounds. Dolphins are thought to perceive only underwater sounds and their training depends largely on visual signals. We investigated the behavioral responses of seven dolphins in a group to learned human-made individual sound cues, played underwater and in the air. Dolphins recognized their own sound cue after hearing it underwater as they immediately moved toward the source, whereas when it was airborne they gazed more at the source of their own sound cue but did not approach it. We hypothesize that they perhaps detected modifications of the sound induced by air or were confused by the novelty of the situation, but nevertheless recognized they were being ""targeted."" They did not respond when hearing another group member's cue in either situation. This study provides further evidence that dolphins respond to individual-specific sounds and that these marine mammals possess some capacity for processing airborne acoustic signals.",29445350,2018,Captive Bottlenose Dolphins Do Discriminate Human-Made Sounds Both Underwater and in the Air.
323,"Objectives: The use of reliable and valid psychometric tools to assess subjectively experienced distress due to tinnitus is broadly recommended. The purpose of the study was the validation of the Italian version of Tinnitus Questionnaire 12 item short form (TQ 12-I) as a brief test for the assessment of patient reported tinnitus-related distress. Design: Cross-sectional multicenter questionnaire study. Setting: Tinnitus Center, European Hospital (Rome), the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, ""Guglielmo da Saliceto"" Hospital (Piacenza), and the Department of Audiology and Phoniatry, ""Mater Domini"" University Hospital (Catanzaro). Participants: One hundred and forty-three outpatients with tinnitus treated at one of the participating medical centers. Main Outcome Measures: Tinnitus Questionnaire Short Form (TQ 12-I), compared to the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey. Results: Our factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution (health anxiety, cognitive distress), accounting for 53.5% of the variance. Good internal consistency for the total score (α = 0.86) and both factors (α = 0.79-0.87) was found. Moderate correlations with the THI (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) indicated good convergent validity. Tinnitus distress was further correlated to increased psychological distress (r = 0.31, p < 0.001) and reduced emotional well-being (r = -0.34, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The study clearly showed that the TQ 12-I is a reliable and valid instrument to assess tinnitus-related distress which can be used in clinical practice as well as for research.",29445353,2018,Validation of the Italian Tinnitus Questionnaire Short Form (TQ 12-I) as a Brief Test for the Assessment of Tinnitus-Related Distress: Results of a Cross-Sectional Multicenter-Study.
324,"Introduction
Seizures are a well-known complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and occur most commonly in the immediate posthemorrhagic period. Most commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure prophylaxis in aSAH include phenytoin and levetiracetam. There is no reliable data available on the safety and efficacy of restricting AED prophylaxis only till the aneurysm is secured.


Methods
We retrospectively chart reviewed patients admitted to our neurosciences intensive care unit (NICU) with aSAH during the past two years. Seizure incidence was studied in patients treated with phenytoin versus levetiracetam and in patients treated for 3-7 days vs. those where AED was discontinued immediately after aneurysm was secured.


Results
In 28 patients, AED prophylaxis was discontinued immediately after the aneurysm was secured, and in 21 patients, it was continued for 3-7 days. Of the 28 patients who received AED prophylaxis for less than or equal to two days, phenytoin was used in 20 patients and levetiracetam was used in eight patients. In patients receiving AED prophylaxis for 3-7 days, phenytoin was used in eight cases and levetiracetam was used in 13 cases. None of these patients had seizures reported during hospitalization or at three-month follow-up.


Conclusion
Stopping the AED prophylaxis immediately after aneurysm coiling is not associated with increased risk of seizures. Seizures at presentation in patients with aSAH are not associated with development of epilepsy at three months. Both phenytoin and levetiracetam are well tolerated in patients with aSAH when limited to the immediate posthemorrhagic period.",29445430,2017,Seizure Prophylaxis in the Immediate Post-Hemorrhagic Period in Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
325,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, and often fatal, brain disease that causes neurodegeneration, resulting in memory loss as well as other cognitive and behavioral problems. Here, we propose a novel multimodal method combining independent components from MRI measures and clinical assessments to distinguish Alzheimer's patients or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from healthy elderly controls. 70 AD subjects (mean age: 77.15 ± 6.2 years), 98 MCI subjects (mean age: 76.91 ± 5.7 years), and 150 HC subjects (mean age: 75.69 ± 3.8 years) were analyzed. Our method includes the following steps: pre-processing, estimating the number of independent components from the MR image data, extracting effective voxels for classification, and classification using a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. As a result, with regards to classifying AD from healthy controls, we achieved a classification accuracy of 97.7%, sensitivity of 99.2%, and specificity of 96.7%; for differentiating MCI from healthy controls, we achieved a classification accuracy of 87.8%, a sensitivity of 86.0%, and a specificity of 89.6; these results are better than those obtained with clinical measurements alone (accuracy of 79.5%, sensitivity of 74.0%, and specificity of 85.1%). We found that (1) both AD patients and MCI subjects showed brain tissue loss, but the volumes of gray matter loss in MCI subjects was far less, supporting the notion that MCI is a prodromal stage of AD; and (2) combining gray matter features from MRI and three commonly used measures of mental status, cognitive function improved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared with classification using only independent components or clinical measurements.",29445429,2017,Classification of MRI and psychological testing data based on support vector machine.
326,"Background
Almost all data on 5-year outcomes for critical care survivors come from North America and Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term mortality, physical function, psychological outcomes and health-related quality of life in a mixed intensive care unit cohort in Australia.


Methods
This longitudinal study evaluated 4- to 5-year outcomes. Physical function (six-minute walk test) and health-related quality of life (Short Form 36 Version 2) were compared to 1-year outcomes and population norms. New psychological data (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, Impact of Events Scale) was collected at follow-up.


Results
Of the 150 participants, 66 (44%) patients were deceased by follow-up. Fifty-six survivors were included with a mean (SD) age of 64 (14.2). Survivors' mean (SD) six-minute walk distance increased between 1 and 4 to 5 years (465.8 m (148.9) vs. 507.5 m (118.2)) (mean difference = - 24.5 m, CI - 58.3, 9.2, p = 0.15). Depressive symptoms were low: median (IQR) score of 7.0 (1.0-15.0). The mean level of post-traumatic stress symptoms was low-median (IQR) score of 1.0 (0-11.0)-with only 9 (16%) above the threshold for potentially disordered symptoms. Short-Form 36 Physical and Mental Component Scores did not change between 1 and 4 to 5 years (46.4 (7.9) vs. 46.7 (8.1) and 48.8 (13) vs. 48.8 (11.1)) and were within a standard deviation of normal.


Conclusions
Outcomes of critical illness are not uniform across nations. Mortality was increased in this cohort; however, survivors achieved a high level of recovery for physical function and health-related quality of life with low psychological morbidity at follow-up.

328,"Background
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the best available treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), requires long-term compliance to be effective. Behavioral interventions may be used to improve adherence to CPAP. We aimed to investigate whether positive or negative message framing impacts on CPAP compliance in patients with OSA, when compared to standard care.


Methods
Consenting patients with confirmed OSA were randomly allocated to receive along with their CPAP either positively or negatively framed messages (Pos; Neg), or standard care (Con). Standardized motivational messages were read out to patients during an initial teaching session and through weekly telephone calls. Patients' compliance data were reviewed 2 and 6 weeks following CPAP initiation.


Results
We randomized 112 patients to groups that were matched for age, BMI, and OSA severity. The positively framed group (Pos) showed greater CPAP usage after 2 weeks (total use 53.7±31.4 hours) as compared to the negatively framed and the control group (35.6±27.4 and 40.8±33.5 hours, P<0.05); however, no differences were seen at 6 weeks. There were more dropouts in the control group than in either framed groups (Pos n=5; Neg n=8; Con n=11; P<0.05).


Conclusions
Positively framed messages can improve CPAP adherence in patients with OSA in the short-term; however, strategies for implementing its long-term use need to be developed.",29445540,2018,The effect of positive and negative message framing on short term continuous positive airway pressure compliance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
329,"Background
According to the general health policies issued in 2014, Health Impact Assessment (HIA) or Health Annex should be implemented in Iran. The present study provided a model for executing HIA in the Iranian context as a developing country.


Methods
This is a system design study with the qualitative approach. The data on the system components were gathered via reviews of the literature, in-depth interviews and focused group discussions (FGDs) with experts. The information were contently analyzed in order to draft the model and a consensus was reached on by the steering committee.


Results
Fifteen in-depth interviews and six FGD meeting were conducted. The equity-based approach in assessing the health impacts of policies, programs and projects were chosen as the most practical tool. Experts believe that for the next five years, HIA should be used just for the ""national projects"" so that the ministries and national agencies could be empowered. Components of the model including structure, procedures, and standards, management style, mission and resources were prepared. The national regulations and protocols were sent to the SCHFS Secretariat for final revision and the council approval.


Conclusion
The hasty implementation of HIA will face serious resistances as the health-oriented attitude and behavior in both government and non-governmental sectors will gradually form. Also, the overlapping of the contents of HIA with other tools such as Environmental, Cultural and Social Impact Assessments, currently used by other sectors, causes difficulties in implementing the HIA by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.",29445635,2018,Implementing Health Impact Assessment at National Level: An Experience in Iran.
330,"Background: Social capital is an important interpersonal organizational resource that may affect health behaviors and seems to be an important factor in chronic diseases. Considering the lack of evidence on this topic, in the present study, we aimed at investigating the association between components of social capital, socioeconomic condition, and controlling Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Iran. Methods: This study was conducted on 300 patients with Type 2 diabetes in Tehran, Iran. In this study, simple random sampling method was used for data collection. Path analysis model was used to examine the potential association between social capital components and to determine the factors that control Type 2 diabetes. Results: In the present study, most of the participants were female (70.7%) and married (78.7%). Path coefficients were calculated by a series of multiple regression analyses based on the conceptual model. The final model had a proper fit with Chi-square = 2.08 (DF = 1, P = 0.049), GFI = 0.542, AGFI = 0.915, NFI = 0.228, RFI = 0.284, IFI = 0.299, TLI = 0.292, CFI = 0.219, and RMSEA = 0.033. The Groups and networks (network) (β = 0.051, p = 0.036) and trust and solidarity (β = -0.018, p = 0.028) had a direct positive and negative effect on HbA1C, respectively. The results also revealed that education levels had a direct positive effect on groups and networks (network) (β = 0.118, p = 0.036), trust and solidarity (β = 0.082, p = 0.007), information and communication (β = 0.037, p = 0.027), and contribution in team works and public activities (β = 0.064, p = 0.003). In addition, education levels had an indirect positive effect on HbA1C through their effect on groups and networks (network), trust and solidarity, and information and communication. Conclusion: Social capital has a significant relationship with diabetes. Although it was not specified clearly which components of social capital were associated with diabetes, trust and solidarity showed a negative direct effect on HbA1C, respectively. Therefore, developing and implementing local and collective programs to build trust and increase the standards of social trust in patients with diabetes can be effective in controlling HbA1C.",29445650,2017,The relationship between social capital components and control of type 2 diabetes: A path analysis model.
331,"Background: Based on the target income hypothesis, the economic behavior of physicians is mainly affected by their target income. This study aimed at designing an instrument to explain how general practitioners (GPs) set their desired income. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire of affecting factors on GPs' target income was extracted from literature reviews and a small qualitative study. Respondents were 666 GPs who completed the questionnaire (response rate= 52%) during 2 seasonal congresses of Iranian GPs. The principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to classify the variables and data reduction. Sample adequacy test, sphericity test, eigenvalues of components, and scree plot were evaluated for PCA. Cronbach's alpha was also checked to assess the internal consistency of the principal components. Results: The results of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy (0.657) and Bartlett's test of sphericity (809.05, p<0.001) revealed that the collected data were suitable for PCA. Based on the scree plot pattern and eigenvalues greater than 1, 6 components including perceived comparative income, importance of responsiveness to patients, perceived socioeconomic status, economic expectations, socioeconomic status of paternal family, and provision of luxury services were selected, which explained 65.19% of the total variance. Finally, only those with a Cronbach's alpha value higher than 0.6 were considered reliable (the first 4 components). Conclusion: Based on the target income hypothesis, a physician's desired level of income affects their behavior. Our developed instrument and its mentioned components can be used in future studies related to GPs' behavior, especially those studies related to the economic aspects of GPs' behavior. It also helps formulate a better payment mechanism for primary care providers.",29445670,2017,General practitioners' views on key factors affecting their desired income: A principal component analysis approach.

333,"Background: Substance abusers are not able to withdraw drugs eternally despite the abundance of different treatments; therefore, withdrawal programs are not quite successful and notwithstanding all the successes of methadone maintenance therapy, there are some defects found in the manner this treatment is applied. Thus, this study was conducted to explore the experience of drug abusers regarding methadone maintenance therapy. Methods: This is a qualitative study using content analysis methodology. The research community includes drug abusers admitted to the treatment centers of the western cities of Mazandaran Province, Iran in 2016. The sampling was purposive and the data were collected by face-to-face single interviews with 20 patients. The interviews were continued up to data saturation. Finally, the Lundman and Grenheim method was used to analyze the interviews and the four criteria of Guba and Lincoln were applied to check data integrity. Results: ""Buying time,"" ""methadone dependence,"" and ""looking from a narrow view to the patient"" were the main three categories that fit the results. Conclusion: Governmental free services for drug abusers; paying attention to different aspects of treatment such as mental, emotional, and social recovery; lifelong support of the family and society members; and balance in prescribing and following the treatment process prescribed by health care providers can enhance both the quality and safety of the treatment process.

335,"Molecular identification and characterization of fear controlling circuitries is a promising path towards developing targeted treatments of fear-related disorders. Three-color in situ hybridization analysis was used to determine whether somatostatin (SOM, Sst), neurotensin (NTS, Nts), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF, Crf), tachykinin 2 (TAC2, Tac2), protein kinase c-δ (PKC-δ, Prkcd), and dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2, Drd2) mRNA colocalize in male mouse amygdala neurons. Expression and colocalization was examined across capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), and medial (CeM) compartments of the central amygdala. The greatest expression of Prkcd and Drd2 were found in CeC and CeL. Crf was expressed primarily in CeL, while Sst-, Nts-, and Tac2-expressing neurons were distributed between CeL and CeM. High levels of colocalization were identified between Sst, Nts, Crf, and Tac2 within the CeL, while little colocalization was detected between any mRNAs within the CeM.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is involved in the inhibition of impulsive behaviors; however, its role in impulse control disorders and addiction is still unclear. Here, we recorded STN local field potentials (LFPs) in PD patients with and without gambling disorder during an economic decision-making task. Reaction times analysis showed that for all patients, the decision whether to risk preceded task onset. We compared then for both groups the STN LFP preceding high- and low-risk economic decisions. We found that risk avoidance in gamblers correlated with larger STN LFP low-frequency (<12-Hz) fluctuations preceding task onset. In particular, the amplitude of low-frequency LFP fluctuations carried significant information about future decisions. Decisions of patients not affected by gambling disorder were instead not correlated with pretask STN LFP. Our results suggest that STN activity preceding task onset affects risk decisions by preemptively inhibiting attraction to high but unlikely rewards in favor of a long-term payoff.",29445770,2018,Subthalamic Neural Activity Patterns Anticipate Economic Risk Decisions in Gambling.
338,"Insulin, a pancreatic hormone, can access the central nervous system, activate insulin receptors distributed in selective brain regions and affect various cellular functions such as neurotransmission. We have previously shown that physiologically relevant concentration of insulin potentiates the GABAA receptor-mediated tonic inhibition and reduces excitability of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) comprises heterogeneous neuronal populations that can respond to hormonal stimulus. Using quantitative PCR and immunofluorescent labeling, we report that the mRNA and protein of the insulin receptor are abundantly expressed in the rat CeA. The insulin receptor mRNA is also detected in the CeA from post-mortem human brain samples. Furthermore, our whole-cell patch-clamp recordings show that the application of insulin (5 and 50 nM) selectively enhances the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in rat CeA neurons. Our findings reveal that GABAergic synaptic transmission is a target in the CeA for insulin receptor signaling that may underlie insulin modulation of emotion- and feeding-related behaviors.",29447952,2018,Insulin enhances GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory currents in rat central amygdala neurons.
339,"Little is known about the career satisfaction of pediatric psychologists, who specialize in psychological research, teaching, and clinical service in the context of pediatric healthcare. As part of the larger Society of Pediatric Psychology Workforce Survey and in collaboration with the American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Studies, this study aimed to: (1) describe the career domains which pediatric psychologists perceive to be important and their satisfaction in each domain, and (2) compare satisfaction of pediatric psychologists across work settings, number of positions, appointment duration, professional roles, career stage, academic rank, and gender. Responses from 336 pediatric psychologists demonstrated high career satisfaction. Domains of career satisfaction that received mean scores indicating high importance include balance of work and personal lives, peer/collegial support, and flexibility and choice in the workplace, but on average respondents reported being only somewhat satisfied in these domains. Total satisfaction scores were significantly higher among pediatric psychologists in 9-10 month appointments, primarily research careers, and at higher academic ranks, but scores were similar across employment settings and genders. To enhance career satisfaction and retention, pediatric psychologists may seek additional mentorship or explore new employment roles, and administrators and managers may consider adopting workplace policies or making environmental changes that could address specific areas of need.

341,"Online labor markets provide new opportunities for behavioral research, but conducting economic experiments online raises important methodological challenges. This particularly holds for interactive designs. In this paper, we provide a methodological discussion of the similarities and differences between interactive experiments conducted in the laboratory and online. To this end, we conduct a repeated public goods experiment with and without punishment using samples from the laboratory and the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We chose to replicate this experiment because it is long and logistically complex. It therefore provides a good case study for discussing the methodological and practical challenges of online interactive experimentation.

342,"The effect of early experiences on the brain during a sensitive period exerts a long-lasting influence on the mature individual. Despite behavioral and neural plasticity caused by early experiences having been reported in the honeybee Apis mellifera, the presence of a sensitive period in which associative experiences lead to pronounced modifications in the adult nervous system is still unclear. Laboratory-reared bees were fed with scented food within specific temporal windows and were assessed for memory retention, in the regulation of gene expression related to the synaptic formation and in the olfactory perception of their antennae at 17 days of age. Bees were able to retain a food-odor association acquired 5-8 days after emergence, but not before, and showed better retention than those exposed to an odor at 9-12 days. In the brain, the odor-rewarded experiences that occurred at 5-8 days of age boosted the expression levels of the cell adhesion proteins neurexin 1 (Nrx1) and neuroligin 2 (Nlg2) involved in synaptic strength. At the antennae, the experiences increased the electrical response to a novel odor but not to the one experienced. Therefore, a sensitive period that induces long-lasting behavioral, functional and structural changes is found in adult honeybees.",29449804,2018,An Early Sensitive Period Induces Long-Lasting Plasticity in the Honeybee Nervous System.
343,"Insects, including those which provide vital ecosystems services as well as those which are devastating pests or disease vectors, locate their resources mainly based on olfaction. Understanding insect olfaction not only from a neurobiological but also from an ecological perspective is therefore crucial to balance insect control and conservation. However, among all sensory stimuli olfaction is particularly hard to grasp. Our chemical environment is made up of thousands of different compounds, which might again be detected by our nose in multiple ways. Due to this complexity, researchers have only recently begun to explore the chemosensory ecology of model organisms such as Drosophila, linking the tools of chemical ecology to those of neurogenetics. This cross-disciplinary approach has enabled several studies that range from single odors and their ecological relevance, via olfactory receptor genes and neuronal processing, up to the insects' behavior. We learned that the insect olfactory system employs strategies of combinatorial coding to process general odors as well as labeled lines for specific compounds that call for an immediate response. These studies opened new doors to the olfactory world in which insects feed, oviposit, and mate.",29449815,2018,"Combinatorial Codes and Labeled Lines: How Insects Use Olfactory Cues to Find and Judge Food, Mates, and Oviposition Sites in Complex Environments."
344,"To cope with the already large, and ever increasing, amount of information stored in organizational memory, ""forgetting,"" as an important human memory process, might be transferred to the organizational context. Especially in intentionally planned change processes (e.g., change management), forgetting is an important precondition to impede the recall of obsolete routines and adapt to new strategic objectives accompanied by new organizational routines. We first comprehensively review the literature on the need for organizational forgetting and particularly on accidental vs. intentional forgetting. We discuss the current state of the art of theory and empirical evidence on forgetting from cognitive psychology in order to infer mechanisms applicable to the organizational context. In this respect, we emphasize retrieval theories and the relevance of retrieval cues important for forgetting. Subsequently, we transfer the empirical evidence that the elimination of retrieval cues leads to faster forgetting to the forgetting of organizational routines, as routines are part of organizational memory. We then propose a classification of cues (context, sensory, business process-related cues) that are relevant in the forgetting of routines, and discuss a meta-cue called the ""situational strength"" cue, which is relevant if cues of an old and a new routine are present simultaneously. Based on the classification as business process-related cues (information, team, task, object cues), we propose mechanisms to accelerate forgetting by eliminating specific cues based on the empirical and theoretical state of the art. We conclude that in intentional organizational change processes, the elimination of cues to accelerate forgetting should be used in change management practices.",29449821,2018,Intentional Forgetting in Organizations: The Importance of Eliminating Retrieval Cues for Implementing New Routines.
345,"Background: Headache is one of the most common complaints in children and adolescents and comorbidity rates are very high and the major associated diseases are depression, anxiety, atopic disorders, sleep, and behavioral disorders. In recent years, it has been highlighted that difficulties regulating emotions such as alexithymia have also been associated with diagnosis of somatization. Methods: We carried out a mini review analyzing the relation between alexithymia and primary headache (e.g., migraine and tension type headache) in children and adolescents by synthesizing the relevant studies in the literature on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Search terms were ""alexithymia"" combined with the ""primary headache,"" ""migraine,"" ""tension type headache,"" ""children,"" and ""adolescents."" Results: All analyzed studies found higher levels of alexithymia in children and adolescents with headache than control groups but there are different opinions about the relationship between headache and alexithymia. For example, some studies suggest that the association between headache and alexithymia in children may be due to an incomplete development of emotive competency or a general immature cognitive development, instead other studies found a correlation between headache symptoms, insecure attachment, and alexithymia. There seems to be also differences between children with migraine compared to those with tension type headache (TTH). Conclusion: There are some studies on adults suffering from headache or migraine and alexithymia, but there is only a moderate amount of research on pediatric age with different opinions and theories about this relationship. Further studies on children and adolescents are necessary to effectively understand this relationship and to help children to reduce headache and improve emotional consciousness.",29449820,2018,Headache and Alexithymia in Children and Adolescents: What Is the Connection?

Regarding early traumas, 56% experienced four or more traumatic forms. Further, gender dysphoric adults showed significantly higher levels of attachment disorganization and polyvictimisation, relative to controls. Comparisons of subgroups, defined by natal gender, showed that trans women, compared to control males, had more involving and physically and psychologically abusive fathers, and were more often separated from their mothers; trans men, relative to female controls, had more involving mothers and were more frequently separated from and neglected by their fathers.

347,"Background: Prison can be characterized as an impoverished environment encouraging a sedentary lifestyle with limited autonomy and social interaction, which may negatively affect self-control and executive function. Here, we aim to study the effects of imprisonment on self-control and executive functions, and we report the change in neuropsychological outcome after 3 months of imprisonment. Materials and Methods: Participants were 37 male inmates in a remand prison in Amsterdam, Netherlands, who completed six tests of a computerized neuropsychological test battery (the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery) in the first week of arrival. Participants were retested after 3 months of imprisonment. Change in performance was tested using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Results: After 3 months of imprisonment, risk taking significantly increased (measured as an increase in the proportion of available points used for betting) and attention significantly deteriorated (measured as increased variability in reaction times on a sustained attention task), with large to medium effect sizes. In contrast, planning significantly improved (measured with a task analog to the Tower of London) with a medium effect size. Discussion: Our study suggests that 3 months of imprisonment in an impoverished environment may lead to reduced self-control, measured as increased risk taking and reduced attentional performance. This is a significant and societally relevant finding, as released prisoners may be less capable of living a lawful life than they were prior to their imprisonment, and may be more prone to impulsive risk-taking behavior. In other words, the impoverished environment may contribute to an enhanced risk of reoffending.",29449824,2018,Reduced Self-Control after 3 Months of Imprisonment; A Pilot Study.

Low vitamin D and/or sun exposure have been associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) onset. However, comparatively, few studies have prospectively examined associations between these factors and clinical course.


Objectives
To evaluate the association of sun exposure parameters and vitamin D levels with conversion to MS and relapse risk in a prospectively monitored cohort of 145 participants followed after a first demyelinating event up to 5-year review (AusLong Study).


Methods
Sun exposure prior to and after onset measured by annual questionnaire; ultraviolet radiation (UVR) ""load"" estimated by location of residence over the life course and ambient UVR levels. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations measured at baseline, 2/3-year, and 5-year review. MS conversion and relapse assessed by neurologist assessment and medical record review.


Results
Over two-thirds (69%) of those followed to 5-year review (100/145) converted to MS, with a total of 252 relapses. Higher pre-MS onset sun exposure was associated with reduced risk of MS conversion, with internal consistency between measures and dose-response relationships. Analogous associations were also seen with risk of relapse, albeit less strong. No consistent associations were observed between postonset sun exposure and clinical course, however. Notably, those who increased their sun exposure during follow-up had significantly reduced hazards of MS conversion and relapse. Serum 25(OH)D levels and vitamin D supplementation were not associated with conversion to MS or relapse hazard.


Conclusion
We found that preonset sun exposure was protective against subsequent conversion to MS and relapses. While consistent associations between postonset sun exposure or serum 25(OH)D level and clinical course were not evident, possibly masked by behavior change, those participants who markedly increased their sun exposure demonstrated a reduced MS conversion and relapse hazard, suggesting beneficial effects of sun exposure on clinical course.",29449827,2018,Sun Exposure across the Life Course Significantly Modulates Early Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Course.

The Demand Control Support Questionnaire (DCSQ) is an established self-reported tool to measure a stressful work environment. Validated German and English versions are however currently missing. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the psychometric properties of German and English versions of the DCSQ among white-collar employees in Switzerland and the US.


Methods
This cross-sectional study was carried out on 499 employees in Switzerland and 411 in the US, respectively. The 17-item DCSQ with three scales assessed psychosocial stress at work (psychological demands, decision latitude, and social support at work). Depressive symptoms were measured by the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Cronbach's α and item-total correlations tested the scale reliability (internal consistency). Construct validity of the questionnaire was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Logistic regressions estimated associations of each scale and job strain with depressive symptoms (criterion validity).


Results
In both samples, all DCSQ scales presented satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.72; item-total correlations ≥ 0.33), and EFA showed the 17 items loading on three factors, which is in line with the theoretically assumed structure of the DCSQ construct. Moreover, all three scales as well as high job strain were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. The associations were stronger in the US sample.

Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), formerly considered as a myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is the most common sarcoma of the extremities in adults and is characterized by a high frequency of local recurrence. The clinical behavior of MFS is unpredictable and the efficacy of chemotherapy is still not well documented. Furthermore, given the relatively recent recognition of MFS as a distinct pathologic entity its cellular and molecular biology has still not been extensively studied in patient-derived preclinical models. We examined the molecular biology and treatment outcomes of high-grade, patient-derived MFS primary cultures.


Methods
A total of three patient-derived MFS primary cultures were analyzed. We evaluated the role of CD109 expression and also looked for a correlation between transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) expression and sensitivity of the primary cultures to different drugs.


Results
CD109 was a promising marker for the identification of more aggressive high-grade MFS and a potential therapeutic target. The results also highlighted the potential role of TGF-β in chemoresistance. Pharmacological analysis confirmed the sensitivity of the cultures to chemotherapy. The most active treatments were epirubicin alone and epirubicin in combination with ifosfamide, the latter representing the current standard of care for soft tissue sarcomas (STSs), including MFS.

Aberrant FOXC1 expression is involved in diverse tumorigenic processes, such as abnormal cell proliferation, cancer stem cell maintenance, cancer migration, and angiogenesis. Herein, we review the correlation between the expression of FOXC1 and tumor behaviors. We also summarize the mechanisms of the regulation of FOXC1 expression and activity in physiological and pathological conditions. In particular, we focus on the pathological processes of cancer targeted by FOXC1 and discuss whether FOXC1 is good or detrimental during tumor progression.

352,"An ongoing obstacle in dealing with minority health disparities is discriminatory behavior from healthcare practitioners, also known as medical discrimination. It is not clear, however, if the effects of medical discriminations onto health are constant across space. For example, there is evidence to suspect minorities in racially segregated neighborhoods suffer less from discrimination compared to those living elsewhere. To determine the presence of spatial heterogeneity underlying medical discrimination, we implement logistic geographically weighted regression (GWR) using individual data in the city of Philadelphia from the 2006 and 2008 Public Health Management Corporation's Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Surveys. Evaluating the potential role residential segregation has in offsetting medical discrimination, we compare the GWR results to tract data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. Through this comparison, we find that the effects of medical discrimination on self-rated health are weaker in magnitude in areas that are mostly minority. However, evidence of direct health benefits for minorities in segregated communities is inconclusive. Thus, while we cannot say living in segregated neighborhoods leads to better minority health, the sting of medical discrimination can be weaker in these places. These results emphasize the importance of local variation, even within a city like Philadelphia, challenging the aspatial one-model-fits-all approach normally found in population studies.",29449905,2018,Searching for Silver Linings: Is Perceived Medical Discrimination Weaker in Segregated Areas?

Integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into the host genome causes global disruption of the chromatin environment. The abundance level of various chromatin-modifying enzymes produces these alterations and affects both the provirus and cellular gene expression. Here, we investigated potential changes in enzyme expression and global DNA methylation in chronically infected individuals with HIV-1 and compared these changes with non-HIV infected individuals. We also evaluated the effect of viral replication and degree of disease progression over these changes.


Results
Individuals with HIV-1 had a significant surge in the expression of DNA and histone methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B, SETDB1, SUV39H1) compared with non-infected individuals, with the exception of PRMT6, which was downregulated. Some histone deacetylases (HDAC2 and HDAC3) were also upregulated in patients with HIV. Among individuals with HIV-1 with various degrees of progression and HIV control, the group of treated patients with undetectable viremia showed greater differences with the other two groups (untreated HIV-1 controllers and non-controllers). These latter two groups exhibited a similar behavior between them. Of interest, the overexpression of genes that associate with viral protein Tat (such as SETDB1 along with DNMT3A and HDAC1, and SIRT-1) was more prevalent in treated patients. We also observed elevated levels of global DNA methylation in individuals with HIV-1 in an inverse correlation with the CD4/CD8 ratio.

Adequate levels of regular physical activity (PA) are crucial for health and well-being. Pediatric burn injuries can have major physiological consequences in both the short and long term. The question is whether these consequences affect post burn PA levels. This study therefore aimed to describe PA and sedentary behavior (SB) in children and adolescents 1-5 years after burn injury.


Methods
Daily PA and SB were monitored in 20 children and adolescents (12 boys and 8 girls, aged 6-17 years, with burns covering 10-37% of total body surface area, 1-5 years post burn) for 1 week using the ActiGraph GTX3+ accelerometer. Activity counts were categorized into SB, light PA, moderate PA, vigorous PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and total PA. Outcomes were compared with non-burned reference values and PA levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).


Results
The participants spent about 5.1 h per day on total PA and 7.4 h on SB. Most of the active time (~ 83%) was categorized as light PA. Thirty-five percent of the group, especially the young boys, spent on average ≥ 60 min on MVPA per day. The boys, although with large interindividual differences, spent more time on MVPA than the girls (p < .005). Older age was associated with less PA time, while more time was spent sedentary. No trends were found indicating an effect of burn characteristics, time post burn, or length of hospital stay, and no differences were found with non-burned peers.


Conclusion
Duration and intensity of PA and SB in children and adolescents 1-5 years after burn injury were similar to non-burned peers. However, only 35% of the group met the WHO physical activity recommendation. Given the increased long term risk for physical conditions following pediatric burns, physical activity should be encouraged in this vulnerable population.

In the current study we employed the mGluR5 tracer [18F]-3-fluoro-5-[(pyridin-3-yl)ethynyl]benzonitrile ([18F]-FPEB) to quantify mGluR5 binding in vivo in adults with autism vs. healthy controls using positron emission tomography (PET).


Results
We identified significantly higher [18F]-FPEB binding potential in the postcentral gyrus and cerebellum of individuals with autism. There was a significant negative correlation between age and [18F]-FPEB binding potential in the cerebellum but not in the postcentral gyrus. In the precuneus, [18F]-FPEB binding potential correlated positively with the lethargy subscale score for the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC). In cerebellum, there were significant negative correlations between [18F]-FPEB binding potential and ABC total score, ABC hyperactivity subscale score, and the ABC inappropriate speech subscale score.

Rates of participation in Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) are low. This may be due, in part, to low levels of autonomous motivation (i.e., motivation that arises from internal sources and sustains healthy behaviors over time) to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among many individuals with prediabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies that incorporate principles from the Self-Determination Theory offer an effective and scalable approach to increase autonomous motivation levels. One promising mobile phone-based application is JOOL Health, which aims to help users connect certain health behaviors (e.g., sleep and diet) with personal values in specific life domains (e.g., family and work). The first aim of this study is to estimate whether JOOL Health can increase autonomous motivation to prevent T2DM among individuals with prediabetes who declined DPP participation. The second aim of this pilot study is to examine the intervention's feasibility and acceptability.


Methods
This is a 12-week, three-arm pilot randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 105 individuals with prediabetes who did not engage in a DPP despite invitation from their health plan to participate in face-to-face or web-based programs at no out-of-pocket-cost. Participants will be randomized to one of three study arms: (1) a group that receives information on prediabetes, evidence-based strategies to decrease progression to T2DM, and a list of resources for mHealth tools for monitoring diet, physical activity, and weight (comparison group); (2) a group that receives the JOOL Health application; and (3) a group that receives the JOOL Health application as well as a Fitbit activity tracker and wireless-enabled scale. Our primary outcome is change in autonomous motivation to prevent T2DM (measured using the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire). We will also collect data related to the intervention's feasibility (recruitment and retention rates) and acceptability (adherence and qualitative experience) as well as changes in psychosocial outcomes, hemoglobin A1c, and weight.


Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims to promote positive health behaviors among individuals with prediabetes who previously declined to participate in a DPP. Our results will inform a larger trial to test the effect of JOOL Health on clinically relevant outcomes, including weight loss, physical activity, and DPP engagement.

Studies show alcohol-preferring mice reduce their alcohol intake during pregnancy; this study questions if the same is true for humans. The current investigation compares women's pre-pregnancy and first trimester alcohol consumption, examines if women with problem drinking diminish their alcohol intake during pregnancy, and determines if prenatal alcohol reduction is associated with characteristics of pregnancy, patients or smoking.


Methods
126 participants in weeks 1-12 of pregnancy, recruited from Obstetric and Family Practices, completed a survey during their initial prenatal visit including two gender-specific AUDITs (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tests) querying current and pre-pregnancy alcohol use. AUDIT-C (AUDIT items 1-3) scores measuring pre-pregnancy and first trimester alcohol consumption were compared, analyzed and tested using general linear model repeated. A p ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant.


Results
Most participants were multiparous, Caucasian high school graduates experiencing nausea and vomiting. Pre-pregnancy alcohol use was significantly (p = 0.019, Fisher's exact) higher among women seeing obstetricians. Pre-pregnancy AUDIT-C scores (m (mean) = 2.22, sd (standard deviation) = 2.19) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than first trimester scores (m = 0.143, sd = 0.532). Among 49 with pre-pregnancy AUDIT-C scores ≥ 3, 45/49 (92%) reduced their alcohol use to zero during the first trimester. Age, race, education, marital status, parity, nausea and vomiting, gestational age and smoking were non-factors in score reduction.

This article reviews empirical findings regarding multiple questions relevant to the issue of free will among addicted smokers: Is smoking voluntary behavior? Can people quit smoking? Why don't people quit smoking? Why do smokers relapse when they try to quit? Do addicted smokers suffer from irresistible cravings? Are there some people who cannot quit? Are there conditions that make resistance impossible? Why would they smoke knowing it can kill them? The evidence reviewed here seems most consistent with the view that smokers retain control over their actions but cannot easily stop having frequent desires to smoke.,29450229,2017,"Addiction, cigarette smoking, and voluntary control of action: Do cigarette smokers lose their free will?"

This paper addresses two overlapping questions: Do addicts have the capacity to voluntarily quit drugs? And do individuals knowingly pursue courses of action that they realize are bad for them, such as excessive drug use?


Methods
I propose two testable versions of free will. First, the observation that activities differ in the degree to which they are susceptible to the influence of their consequences (e.g., costs and benefits) has proven a useful criterion for classifying behavior as voluntary or involuntary. Thus, we can ask if drug use in addicts is influenced by its consequences. For instance, do laws that promise legal sanctions for drug use reduce drug use in addicts? Second, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt proposed a definition of free will that takes into account desires and self-reflection. I propose that addicts who do not want to desire drugs and successfully stop craving drugs pass his test.


Results
Dependence on illicit drugs typically ends after about four to six years. Dependence on cigarettes and alcohol persists for much longer, but most smokers and alcoholics eventually voluntarily quit using. Smokers and heroin addicts can voluntarily regulate their drug cravings as a function of the availability of their drug of choice. They have the capacity to pass Frankfurt's test of free will.

362,"Certain people are at risk for using alcohol or other drugs excessively and for developing problems with their use. Their susceptibility might arise from a variety of factors, including their genetic make-up, brain chemistry, family background, personality and other psychological variables, and environmental and sociocultural variables. Moreover, after substance use has become established, there are additional cognitive-motivational variables (e.g., substance-related attentional bias) that contribute to enacting behaviors consistent with the person's motivation to acquire and use the substance. People who are at such risk are likely to choose to use addictive substances even though doing so entails negative consequences. In the sense of complete freedom from being determined by causal factors, we believe that there is no such thing as free will, but defined as ability to make choices from among multiple options, even though the choices are ultimately governed by natural processes, addicted individuals are free to choose. Although they might appear unable to exercise this kind of free will in decisions about their substance use, addictive behaviors are ultimately always goal-directed and voluntary. Such goal pursuits manifest considerable flexibility. Even some severely addicted individuals can cease their use when the value of continuing the use abruptly declines or when the subjective cost of continuing the use is too great with respect to the incentives in other areas of their lives. Formal treatment strategies (e.g., contingency management, Systematic Motivational Counseling, cognitive training) can also be used to facilitate this reversal.",29450231,2017,Free will in addictive behaviors: A matter of definition.

Participants were school children (mean age 13.5 years at Time 1) participating in a Randomized Controlled Trial in the UK, who completed a battery of questionnaires examining alcohol-use indicators, loneliness, self-efficacy and sensation seeking at Time 1 and at +12 months. Loneliness at Time 1 had a substantive, though largely indirect (i.e., via self-efficacy and sensation seeking covariates), impact on alcohol-related harm at +12 months. Furthermore, Loneliness interacted with gender in the prediction of context of alcohol use, where being female and experiencing loneliness put an individual at a greater risk of unsupervised drinking. Females experiencing loneliness were also 2.9 times as likely to have had a drink in the past 30 days, and around 2.5 times as likely to have ever consumed a full drink, when compared to their male peers. The current results indicate that loneliness is an important but complex factor in adolescent drinking. There are important implications for the development of interventions to prevent underage drinking, not least that it is not appropriate to consider all underage drinkers as socially marginalised. However, for those that are, the self-medication hypothesis is potentially relevant through emotional self-efficacy.",29450238,2017,The direct and indirect effect of loneliness on the development of adolescent alcohol use in the United Kingdom.
364,"Background
Fitness exercise is popular and associated with improved health and social status. Taken to extremes, however, exercise can become an addiction. One suggested symptom of exercise addiction is ""conflicts"" with family and friends. However, it may be difficult to recognize excessive exercise patterns if they are accepted and encouraged by relatives. The aim of this study was to explore if fitness exercisers with a high risk of addiction experienced the same level of exercise support as exercisers with a low risk of addiction. Furthermore, we wanted to examine if social support affected the subjective reporting of ""conflicts"".


Method
A total of 577 fitness exercisers completed the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and two questions asking about ""exercise support from family and friends"" and ""present eating disorder"".


Results
Exercisers at high risk of exercise addiction reported the same level of support from relatives as those at low risk. Exercisers with high levels of exercise support reported significantly fewer conflicts, even if they were at high risk of addiction. If an eating disorder was present, the level of exercise support was significantly reduced.


Conclusion
Exercise addiction might be difficult to identify with the general behavioral addiction symptom ""conflict"", since exercise is socially accepted even in subjects with high risk of exercise addiction. If an eating disorder is present, the exercise routines seem to be interpreted as socially undesirable. Screening for exercise addiction with the EAI should take into account that fitness exercisers rarely report conflicts, which could result in false negative cases.",29450243,2017,Is exercise addiction in fitness centers a socially accepted behavior?
365,"The UPPS-P model of impulsivity proposes that impulsivity comprises five distinct facets-negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and sensation seeking. The UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale has been used to measure these facets. The purpose of the current study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a Swedish version of the 20-item UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (SUPPS-P). The sample comprised 343 Swedish young adults (Mage = 24.21, SD = 2.01; 27% men, 2% other or undisclosed gender identity) who answered a questionnaire including the SUPPS-P; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21); and questions regarding their alcohol consumption and substance use. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a 5-factor, inter-correlated model, where each subscale of the SUPPS-P constitutes one latent variable. The convergent validity was established by replicating previously found correlations between the different impulsivity facets and depression, anxiety, frequency of alcohol consumption, and substance use. The internal consistency was acceptable for all the SUPPS-P subscales (Cronbach's α = 0.65-0.78, McDonald's ω = 0.65-0.79), except lack of perseverance (Cronbach's α = 0.60, McDonald's ω = 0.61). Thus, while the Swedish version of the SUPPS-P is suitable for assessing impulsivity in Swedish young adult samples, further research is needed to improve the psychometric properties of the lack of perseverance subscale.",29450246,2017,Validation of a Swedish version of the short UPPS-P impulsive behavior scale among young adults.

Few studies have estimated screen time among Arab adolescents, and no studies, to date, have published data on addiction to video games or Internet games among Arab adolescents. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of addiction to video games and its correlation with mental health in a sample of expatriate high school students from the Al-Qassim region of Saudi Arabia.


Methods
The survey was conducted in 2016 among 276 students enrolled in ninth through twelfth grades in the International Schools in Buraidah, Al-Qassim. Students who returned signed consent forms from their parents filled out a self-administered questionnaire that included validated scales on addiction to video games, general health, and lifestyle.


Results
The proportion between the sexes and the schools were roughly equal. Around 32% were overweight or obese, 75% had screen time ≥ 2 h/day, and 20% slept < 5 h/night. Sixteen per cent (16%) were addicted to video games and 54% had psychological distress. Addiction to video games was strongly associated with psychological distress (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.80, 9.47). Other significant correlates were female gender, higher screen time, and shorter sleep hours.


Conclusions
The proportion of students with psychological distress was high. Future studies should investigate other potential correlates of distress such personal traits, family relations, and academic performance.",29450245,2017,Video game addiction and psychological distress among expatriate adolescents in Saudi Arabia.
367,"Introduction
Change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST) are thought to reflect underlying motivation and be important mechanisms of behavior change (MOBCs). However, greater specificity and experimental rigor is needed to establish CT and ST as MOBCs. Testing the effects of self-directed language under laboratory conditions is one promising avenue. The current study presents a replication and extension of research examining the feasibility for using simulation tasks to elicit self-directed language.


Methods
First-year college students (N = 92) responded to the Collegiate Simulated Intoxication Digital Elicitation, a validated task for assessing decision-making in college drinking. Verbal responses elicited via free-response and structured interview formats were coded based on established definitions of CT and ST, with minor modifications to reflect the non-treatment context. Associations between self-directed language and alcohol use at baseline and eight months were examined. Additionally, this study examined whether a contextually-based measure of decision-making, behavioral willingness, mediated relationships between self-directed language and alcohol outcome.


Results
Healthy talk and unhealthy talk independently were associated with baseline alcohol use across both elicitation formats. Only healthy talk during the free-response elicitation was associated with alcohol use at follow up; both healthy talk and unhealthy talk during the interview elicitation were associated with 8-month alcohol use. Behavioral willingness significantly mediated the relationship between percent healthy talk and alcohol outcome.


Conclusions
Findings support the utility of studying self-directed language under laboratory conditions and suggest that such methods may provide a fruitful strategy to further understand the role of self-directed language as a MOBC.",29450249,2018,Towards an understanding of self-directed language as a mechanism of behavior change: A novel strategy for eliciting client language under laboratory conditions.
368,"Objective
To investigate the association of alcohol and cocaine use with urban violence (both as victim and as perpetrator) in a representative sample of the Brazilian population.


Method
The Second Brazilian Alcohol and Drugs Survey (II BNADS) interviewed 4607 individuals aged 14 years and older from the Brazilian household population including an oversample of 1157 adolescents (14 to 18 years old). The survey gathered information on alcohol, tobacco and illegal substances use as well as on risk factors for abuse and dependence, behaviors associated with the use of substances and the possible consequences, as urban violence indicators.


Results
Approximately 9.3% of the Brazilian population has been victim of at least one form of urban violence. This proportion increases to 19.7% among cocaine users and to 18.1% among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Perpetration of violence was reported by 6.2% of the sample. Cocaine use and AUD increased in almost four times the chances of being an aggressor. Being religious and married decreased the chances of being a victim and/or perpetrador of urban violence. Higher education also decreased the chances of involvement in both victimization or perpetration of violence. Both Parallel Mediation Models considering cocaine use as a predictor of urban violence (victimization or perpetration) were valid and alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms were mediators of this relationship.


Conclusions
This study presents relevant data of interest to Brazil as this country is one of the major consumer market of cocaine and also is among the most violent countries worldwide.",29450250,2018,Association between drug use and urban violence: Data from the II Brazilian National Alcohol and Drugs Survey (BNADS).

The expansion of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program requires more data about the factors affecting the effectiveness of treatment, especially behavioral data such as smoking and alcohol use among patients. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of tobacco and alcohol consumption and identify related factors among MMT patients in the Vietnamese rural mountainside.


Methods
We interviewed 241 MMT patients in two clinics in Tuyen Quang, a mountainous province in Vietnam. Patients were asked to report the smoking status (current smoker or not), nicotine dependence (by Fagerström test for nicotine dependence - FTND) and alcohol use (by using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - AUDIT-C). EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) and EQ-Visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) were employed to measure health-related quality of life. Multivariate logistic and Tobit regressions were used to identify the associated factors.


Results
The majority of respondents were current smokers (75.7%) and a low proportion were hazardous drinkers (18.3%). People receiving treatment in a rural clinic (OR = 0.45; 95%CI = 0.22-0.92) and had problems in usual activities (OR = 0.20; 95%CI = 0.06-0.70) were less likely to be smokers. Q-VAS score (Coef. = 0.03; 95%CI = 0.02-0.05) and having problems in mobility (Coef. = 0.72; 95%CI = 0.03-1.42) was found to be associated with the increase of nicotine dependence. In terms of alcohol drinking, people with other jobs were more likely to drink hazardously compared to unemployed patients (OR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.20-6.82). Similarly, patients having higher duration of MMT had higher likelihood of being hazardous drinkers (OR = 1.07; 95%CI = 1.01-1.13).


Conclusions
This study highlights the low rate of alcohol abusers but a considerably high proportion of current smokers among MMT patients in the rural mountainside area. Alcohol and tobacco counseling programs combined with social and family support also play an essential role in alcohol and tobacco control. In addition, implementing mass community-based behavioral change campaigns to reduce drug addiction-related stigmatization should also be prioritized.",29450252,2018,Alcohol and tobacco use among methadone maintenance patients in Vietnamese rural mountainside areas.
370,"Introduction
The proliferation of electronic devices, such as vape-pens, has provided alternative means for cannabis use. Research has found cannabis-vaping (i.e., vape-pen use) is associated with lower perceived risks and higher cannabis use. Knowledge of these products may increase likelihood of subsequent use. As policies for cannabis shift, beliefs that peers and family approve of this substance use (injunctive norms) increase and there has been an increase in vape-pen use among young adults (18-35 year olds); however, correlates thereof remain unknown. Young adults often engage in cross-substance use with cannabis and alcohol, making alcohol a potential correlate of cannabis vape-pen use and knowledge. Therefore, we examined alcohol use and other potential correlates of vape-pen use and knowledge among a sample of university students.


Methods
This secondary data analysis utilized surveys at multiple colleges in the U.S. (N = 270). Alcohol use, social anxiety, cannabis expectancies, injunctive and descriptive norms and facets of impulsivity were examined as correlates of vape-pen use and knowledge using bivariate correlations and logistic regressions.


Results
Alcohol use was correlated with cannabis vape-pen use and knowledge. Frequency of cannabis use, peer injunctive norms, and positive expectancies were associated with increased likelihood of vape-pen use. Lack of premeditation, a facet of impulsivity, was associated with cannabis vape-pen knowledge.


Conclusions
Given the unknown nature and consequences of cannabis vape-pens, the present findings offer valuable information on correlates of this behavior. Further, correlates of knowledge of vape-pens may point to areas for education and clinical intervention to prevent heavy cannabis vape-pen use.",29450254,2018,Correlates of cannabis vape-pen use and knowledge among U.S. college students.
371,"Relapse to smoking after initial abstinence is a major clinical challenge with significant public health consequences. At the brain and behavioral level, those who relapse to tobacco smoking have both greater cue-reactivity and lower inhibitory control than those who remain abstinent. Little is known about neural activation during inhibitory control tasks in the presence of drug-related cues. In the current study, tobacco smokers (SMK; n = 22) and non-smoking controls (CON; n = 19) completed a Go/NoGo task involving smoking cues during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Following the scan session, smokers were required to quit smoking, and maintenance of abstinence was evaluated as part of a 12-week smoking cessation trial. We evaluated pre-cessation brain activity during NoGo trials in smokers who were versus were not able to quit smoking. We then compared fMRI and inhibitory control measures between smokers and non-smokers. We did not find differences between SMK and CON in performance or activation to smoking or neutral cues. However, compared to SMK who relapsed, SMK who attained biochemically-validated abstinence at the end of the smoking cessation trial had greater neural activation in the anterior insula during NoGo trials specifically with smoking-related cues. Results indicate that within SMK, decreased inhibitory control activation during direct exposure to drug-related stimuli may be a marker of difficulty quitting and relapse vulnerability.",29450255,2018,Anterior insula activation during inhibition to smoking cues is associated with ability to maintain tobacco abstinence.
372,"Those who binge drink are at increased risk for alcohol-related consequences when compared to non-binge drinkers.

This study created and validated the Barriers to Alcohol Reduction (BAR) scale. Participants were college students (n = 230) who endorsed at least one instance of past-month binge drinking (4+ drinks for women or 5+ drinks for men). Using classical test theory, exploratory structural equation modeling found a two-factor structure of personal/psychosocial barriers and perceived program barriers. The sub-factors, and full scale had reasonable internal consistency (i.e., coefficient omega = 0.78 (personal/psychosocial), 0.82 (program barriers), and 0.83 (full measure)). The BAR also showed evidence for convergent validity with the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (r = 0.39, p < .001) and discriminant validity with Barriers to Physical Activity (r = -0.02, p = .81). Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis showed the two factors separately met the unidimensionality assumption, and provided further evidence for severity of the items on the two factors. Results suggest that the BAR measure appears reliable and valid for use in an undergraduate student population of binge drinkers.

373,"Background and Purpose: Corneal injury can result in dysfunction of corneal nociceptive signaling and corneal sensitization. Activation of the endocannabinoid system has been reported to be analgesic and anti-inflammatory. The purpose of this research was to investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids with reported actions at cannabinoid 1 (CB1R) and cannabinoid 2 (CB2R) receptors and/or noncannabinoid receptors in an experimental model of corneal hyperalgesia. Methods: Corneal hyperalgesia (increased pain response) was generated using chemical cauterization of the corneal epithelium in wild-type (WT) and CB2R knockout (CB2R-/-) mice. Cauterized eyes were treated topically with the phytocannabinoids Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8THC) or cannabidiol (CBD), or the CBD derivative HU-308, in the presence or absence of the CB1R antagonist AM251 (2.0 mg/kg i.p.), or the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (1 mg/kg i.p.). Behavioral pain responses to a topical capsaicin challenge at 6 h postinjury were quantified from video recordings. Mice were euthanized at 6 and 12 h postcorneal injury for immunohistochemical analysis to quantify corneal neutrophil infiltration. Results: Corneal cauterization resulted in hyperalgesia to capsaicin at 6 h postinjury compared to sham control eyes. Neutrophil infiltration, indicative of inflammation, was apparent at 6 and 12 h postinjury in WT mice. Application of Δ8THC, CBD, and HU-308 reduced the pain score and neutrophil infiltration in WT mice. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory actions of Δ8THC, but not CBD, were blocked by the CB1R antagonist AM251, but were still apparent, for both cannabinoids, in CB2R-/- mice. However, the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory actions of HU-308 were absent in the CB2R-/- mice. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of CBD were blocked by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635. Conclusion: Topical cannabinoids reduce corneal hyperalgesia and inflammation. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of Δ8THC are mediated primarily via CB1R, whereas that of the cannabinoids CBD and HU-308, involve activation of 5-HT1A receptors and CB2Rs, respectively.

374,"Cardiac arrests are often preceded by a period of physiological deterioration. Preventing potentially avoidable cardiac arrests therefore depends on reliable recognition of, and response to, those deteriorations. Our hospital's acute medical unit had one of the highest rates of cardiac arrest in our organisation at baseline. The aim was to reduce our unit's cardiac arrest rate by over 50%. Pareto chart analysis identified unreliable processes in the recognition and response to deteriorating patients. Process mapping exercises were performed, then the model for improvement and rapid cycle tests of change were used to develop standardised processes for clinical observations, recognising deteriorating patients and responding to hypoxia. Multidisciplinary learning from what went well, incorporating resilience engineering principles, helped to identify good practice and then test ways of making good practice happen more reliably. Learning from success also addressed some of the psychological barriers to change by encouraging pride in work and a positive focus within our unit. The cardiac arrest rate reduced from 4.3/1000 (October 2014 to February 2016) to 1.1/1000 (March 2016 to end of 2016), associated with improved reliability of the following process measures: reliability of clinical observations, documentation of target oxygen saturations, identification of hypoxia and completion of structured response to hypoxia.

However, research shows that between 28% and 52% of emergency medical services (EMS) providers usually seek psychological help in various EMS cultures, where 86% of them usually suffer from critical stress. Thus, we decided to design a quality improvement project that aims to improve the referral process by increasing cases referred to the PSU at SRCA in Riyadh Region by 75% in 2 months. A multidisciplinary team has been formed to analyse the problem using quality tools including, brainstorming, fishbone diagram and flow chart of the PSU processes. Several possible reasons have been identified, such as lack of awareness among the SRCA's employees about PSU and its services, and the concern about privacy and confidentiality during psychological consultations in the PSU, in addition to the long referring process to PSU. The team decided to test the following change ideas: increasing the awareness of employees about the PSU services, improving the privacy and confidentiality during the consultation using electronic channels, and finally re-engineering the referral process to make it lean and remove all the unnecessary steps. Several improvement interventions have been tested sequentially in three consecutive Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles on a weekly basis. The project findings demonstrated that the first change idea was successful but not reaching the target while the second change had led to huge impact exceeding our target but with short effect. On the other hand, although the third change idea of re-engineering the PSU referral process had led to negative result initially, over the following weeks of measurement the results turned to be positive and meeting our expectations. We concluded that re-engineering referral process is most effective improvement intervention among other change ideas in term of magnitude and sustainability of the effect on increasing the number of referral cases to the PSU. We recommend conducting further testing and measuring of these change ideas in other PSU across the SRCA to understand the diffident context in other regions of SRCA.",29450278,2017,Improving referral to psychological support unit at Saudi Red Crescent Authority in Riyadh Region.

Specialists have to discover other channels or embed attractive elements in the advertisements' messages to cut through the clutter and catch the consumers' attention. The evolution of the concept of service has changed from the commercial status to determining a lifestyle. Buying a service has led to a change in the consumer behavior. Consumers want to buy services that dazzle their senses, touch their hearts, and stimulate their minds, not as before, excellent or satisfying. Ophthalmology is the medical specialty that is the most oriented toward outpatient care, as hospitalization is required only in a small percentage of cases. The objective of this case study was to investigate the perception of Romanian adult consumers on ophthalmology services from an experiential marketing perspective, by using the Focus Group method. Ophthalmology requires a wide range of skills due to the diversity of consumers who demand specialized consultations. Experiential marketing is a valuable strategy that ophthalmologic organizations may use to target specific consumers. The purpose of this case study was to identify the perceptions of Romanian adults on experiential marketing campaigns and determine the degree to which these campaigns influenced their decisions of buying an ophthalmologic service. Using a snowball sampling technique we have sent a filter questionnaire to 40 people on the internet. The filter questionnaire consisted of questions about wearing eyeglasses, the period of wearing them, the last ophthalmologic consultation, the type of ophthalmologic clinic they were going to, age and education.

To explore the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behaviors, health insurance coverage, and use of SRH services of women in the United States (U.S.) by nativity, disaggregated by race and ethnicity.


STUDY DESIGN
We analyzed publicly-available and restricted data from the National Survey of Family Growth to assess differences and similarities between foreign-born and U.S.-born women, both overall and within Hispanic, non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, and NH Asian groups.


RESULTS
A larger proportion of foreign-born women than U.S.-born women lacked health insurance coverage. Foreign-born women utilized SRH services at lower rates than U.S.-born women; this effect diminished at the multivariate level, although race and ethnicity differences remained. Overall, foreign-born women were less likely to pay for SRH services with private insurance than U.S.-born women. Foreign-born women were less likely to use the most effective contraceptive methods than U.S.-born women, with some variation across race and ethnicity: NH white and NH black foreign-born women were less likely to use highly effective contraceptive methods than their U.S.-born counterparts, but among Hispanic women, the reverse was true.

380,"In E. coli chemosensory arrays, transmembrane receptors, a histidine autokinase CheA, and a scaffolding protein CheW interact to form an extended hexagonal lattice of signaling complexes. One interaction, previously assigned a crucial signaling role, occurs between chemoreceptors and the CheW-binding P5 domain of CheA. Structural studies showed a receptor helix fitting into a hydrophobic cleft at the boundary between P5 subdomains. Our work aimed to elucidate the in vivo roles of the receptor-P5 interface, employing as a model the interaction between E. coli CheA and Tsr, the serine chemoreceptor. Crosslinking assays confirmed P5 and Tsr contacts in vivo and their strict dependence on CheW. Moreover, the P5 domain only mediated CheA recruitment to polar receptor clusters if CheW was also present. Amino acid replacements at CheA.P5 cleft residues reduced CheA kinase activity, lowered serine response cooperativity and partially impaired chemotaxis. Pseudoreversion studies identified suppressors of P5 cleft defects at other P5 groove residues or at surface-exposed residues in P5 subdomain 1, which interacts with CheW in signaling complexes. Our results indicate that a high-affinity P5-receptor binding interaction is not essential for core complex function. Rather, P5 groove residues are probably required for proper cleft structure and/or dynamic behavior, which likely impact conformational communication between P5 subdomains and the strong binding interaction with CheW that is necessary for kinase activation. We propose a model for signal transmission in chemotaxis signaling complexes in which the CheW-receptor interface plays the key role in conveying signaling-related conformational changes from receptors to the CheA kinase.",29453948,2018,Noncritical signaling role of a kinase-receptor interaction surface in the Escherichia coli chemosensory core complex.
381,"Schistosomiasis is a snail-transmitted infectious disease caused by a long lasting infection with a blood fluke of the genus Schistosoma. S. haematobium and S. mansoni are the species endemic in Egypt. The country has been plagued and seriously suffered from schistosomiasis over the past 5000 years. Great strides had been done in controlling the disease since 1922. The history, epidemiology and the different control approaches were reviewed. Currently, Egypt is preparing towards schistosomiasis elimination by 2020. The new strategy depends on four main axes; large scale treatment in all areas of residual transmission by targeting entire populations with PZQ, intensified snail control, heath education and behavioral changes and expansion of the complementary public health interventions. While on the road towards elimination, we addressed here the important challenges, lessons and the key issues from the different control strategies to help the achievement of our goal. Notably, frangibility of the drug based control, emergence of resistance against PZQ, persistence of some hot spots areas, the need of further control efforts to the high risk individuals and community involvement in the control programs, reconsideration of diagnostic tests used in surveillance, and continous monitoring of the field to detect changes in the snail intermediate host. Importantly, the adaptation between the parasite and its intermediate snail host throughout water bodies in Egypt merits attention as Schistosoma infection can be introduced to the new reclaimed areas.

383,"Determination of intraguild interactions between entomopathogens and predators is important when attempting to use a combination of these two natural enemy groups for biological control of their shared arthropod pest species. This study assessed the effects of Beauveria bassiana on the predation and associated behavior of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, against Tetranychus urticae. The functional response tests showed that P. persimilis exhibited a Holling type II response on the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, when treated with either a B. bassiana or Tween-80 suspension. There were no significant differences between the treatments in the number of T. urticae consumed. The laboratory choice test indicated that P. persimilis displayed a significant avoidance response to B. bassiana on bean leaves immediately following spray application. They also spent significantly longer time in self-grooming behavior on leaf disks sprayed with fungal conidia than on discs treated with Tween-80. There were no significant differences in the predation rates on T. urticae eggs between the different treatments. The potted plant investigations indicated that P. persimilis showed significant aversion behavior to the initial fungal spray, but gradually dispersed over the entire bean plants. Observations using scanning electron microscopy revealed that fungal conidia were attached to the body of P. persimilis after mounting the leaf disk treated with B. bassiana, which would account for its varied behavioral responses. Our study suggests that fungal spray did not affect the predation capability of P. persimilis and poses a negligible risk to their behavior.",29453965,2018,Effects of Beauveria bassiana on predation and behavior of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis.
384,"Para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) is a synthetic drug chemically similar to the recreational drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") and often replaces MDMA in tablets that show an ""ecstasy"" logo. PMA displays a higher toxic potential than MDMA, but the behavioral profile of PMA has been scarcely studied in animal models. Here we evaluated the effects of PMA (2, 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg, i.p.) on agonist encounters between male mice using an ethopharmacological approach, the isolation-induced aggression model. Likewise, since PMA and MDMA share common mechanisms of action, we compared the behavioral profile of PMA with that induced by MDMA (8 mg/kg, i.p.) which behavioral effects in this model are well characterized. Individually housed mice were exposed to anosmic standard opponents 30 min after drug administration. The encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis. PMA (all doses) significantly reduced offensive behaviors (threat and attack), however, a detailed behavioral analysis suggests that the observed antiaggressive effect seems to be unspecific, showing a complex dose-dependent behavioral profile. Thus, antiaggresive actions observed after the administration of the lowest dose were accompanied by increases in social investigation, avoidance/flee behaviors and non-social explorations, together with a reduction of digging behavior. This pattern reflects both approach-contact behaviors and avoidance-flee behaviors. From 4 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, the increase in social investigation previously observed disappears, and there is a slight increase in immobility, together with a different behavioral pattern that suggests anxiogenic effects of PMA, similar to those reported after the administration of MDMA. The higher doses of PMA exhibit a behavioral profile very similar to that observed in animals treated with MDMA, with the exception of the immobility produced by PMA. These findings show for the first time the non-specific antiaggressive profile of PMA in the model of aggression induced by isolation in male mice.",29453997,2018,Effects of para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) on agonistic encounters between male mice.
385,"Stress tasks performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) elicit a relatively small cortisol response compared to stress tasks completed in a traditional behavioral laboratory, which may be due to apprehension of fMRI that elicits an anticipatory stress response. The present study investigated whether anticipatory stress is greater prior to research completed in an MRI environment than in a traditional behavioral laboratory. Anticipatory stress (indexed by cortisol) was greater prior to testing in the MRI environment than traditional behavioral laboratory. Furthermore, anticipation of fMRI elicited a cortisol response commensurate with the response to the stress task in the behavioral laboratory. However, in the MRI environment, post-stress cortisol was significantly lower than baseline cortisol. Taken together, these findings suggest the stress elicited by anticipation of fMRI may lead to acute elevations in cortisol prior to scanning, which may in turn disrupt the cortisol response to stress tasks performed during scanning.",29454000,2018,Anticipatory stress associated with functional magnetic resonance imaging: Implications for psychosocial stress research.
386,"Night Eating Syndrome (NES), as a diagnosis, presents as a combination of disordered eating, sleep and mood. Patients identified as having both NES and obesity demonstrate poorer outcomes in terms of weight loss compared to those with NES only. However, research focusing on psychological factors associated with NES remains relatively underdeveloped. This study aimed to explore the relationship between NES and the experience of emotion from the perspective of patients accessing a weight management service. Ten adults who met diagnostic criteria for moderate or full NES took part in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using a constructivist approach to grounded theory. A core concept to emerge from the analysis was termed 'emotional hunger'; reflecting an urge or need to satiate a set of underlying unmet emotional needs. It was underpinned by the following interrelated themes: (1) Cultivating a dependency on food; (2) Relying on food to regulate emotions; (3) Understanding the significance of night-time; (4) Acknowledging the consequences of night eating. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the relationship between NES and the experience of emotion from the perspective of patients attending a weight management service. Results have potential to inform future service development, particularly around the adoption of a more holistic approach to night eating behaviours.",29454015,2018,"Why i eat at night: A qualitative exploration of the development, maintenance and consequences of Night Eating Syndrome."
387,"The feeding strategies that parents use with their children shape their children's attitudes and behaviors toward food. The present research examined whether personality traits of the mother and the child are associated with the types of feeding strategies mothers use with their children. The present research also examined whether these characteristics are associated with the child's body mass index (BMI). Mothers (N = 2928) reported how often they used three feeding strategies (Restriction, Pressure to Eat, Monitoring) with the target child and their personality and the personality of the child. Both mother and child Conscientiousness were associated significantly with less use of Restriction and Pressure to Eat and more use of Monitoring. Child Openness and Agreeableness were likewise related to less use of Restriction and Pressure to Eat. Mother and child Conscientiousness were associated with child obesity: Children with obesity scored lower in Conscientiousness and also had mothers who scored lower on this trait; Restriction and Pressure to Eat partially mediated the association between mother Conscientiousness and child BMI. The present findings suggest that individual differences in both mother and child personality are associated with the use of three common feeding strategies in childhood and the child's weight.",29454016,2018,Mother and child personality traits associated with common feeding strategies and child body mass index.
388,"The Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) was designed to assess procedural pain in infants and is considered valid for assessing immunisation pain. The aim of this study was to assess the practical and psychometric properties of the MBPS when applied to other commonly performed procedures. Twenty-six clinicians independently applied the MBPS scale to segments of video collected from 100 children aged six to 42 months undergoing one of four procedures in the emergency department. Positive correlation between MBPS and VASobs pain (r = 0.74) was shown and inter- and intra-rater reliability coefficients were high (0.87 and 0.89, respectively). Construct validity was demonstrated by scale responsiveness to painful stimuli (4.6 times increase in scores across phases) and the capacity of the scale to distinguish between painful versus non-painful procedures, p < 0.001. However, mean baseline scores for procedures were not zero (likely a function of item descriptors for a 'zero' score) and the mean difference increased across phases for children with baseline scores greater than 3 was much lower than for children with scores less than 3, p = 0.0001. Finally, 28% of scores changed following the second viewing of a video segment. The MBPS appears reliable and sensitive to procedural pain when applied by clinicians. Results question the capacity of the scale to differentiate between pain- and non-pain related distress, the feasibility of this scale and the appropriateness of item descriptors for medical procedures.",29454046,2018,The Psychometric Properties of the MBPS Scale Used to Assess Procedural Pain.
389,"The aim of present study was to design a controlled release system using Cuminum cyminum essential oil loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CEO-CSNPs) and evaluate its effect on catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (POD) activity and ascorbic acid content of Agaricus bisporus fruit bodies during 20 days of storage at 4 °C. The success of encapsulation was evaluated through TEM, DLS, FT-IR and spectrophotometry and its release behavior was studied in buffer solutions with different pH. The CEO-CSNPs exhibited an average size of 30 to 80 nm with a spherical shape. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) were 4.46 to 17.89% and 2.47 to 6.68%, respectively. The highest CAT and GR activity was observed in samples packed with CEO-CSNPs after 15 days of storage. In contrast, POD activity reached a peak at the end of storage in control samples. Interestingly, after 20 days the level of POD increased 17.13% in CEO-CSNPs treatment, as compared with the initial level of the mentioned enzyme. At the end of storage, ascorbic acid content in samples treated with CEO-CSNPs was significantly higher than that detected in the control samples. In brief, application of CEO loaded chitosan nanoparticles in packages effectively increased the antioxidant activity in white button mushroom and showed promising results for extending the shelf life of treated samples.",29454053,2018,Development and characterization of nano biopolymer containing cumin oil as a new approach to enhance antioxidant properties of button mushroom.

Then CMKGM and chitosan (CS) were crosslinked and freeze-dried to prepare CMKGM/CS composite sponges with different proportions. The structure and micromorphology of CMKGM/CS sponges were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. The SEM results showed that the pore structure of the composite sponge gradually increased with the increase of CMKGM content. To assess the applicability of CMKGM/CS composite sponges as wound dressing, the swelling behavior, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), biocompatibility (cytotoxicity and hemolysis) were analyzed. The results indicated that CMKGM/CS composite sponges possessed high swelling ratio, proper WVTR and good biocompatibility, which might accelerate tissue regeneration. Meanwhile, in vivo experiments demonstrated that CMKGM/CS composite sponges could effectively heal full-layer wound of skin defects of male ICR mice.",29454058,2018,Carboxymethyl konjac glucomannan - Crosslinked chitosan sponges for wound dressing.

At present, nanomedicine (NM) development is hampered by methodological barriers for a better characterization and a wider understanding of their in vivo behavior. While regulatory agencies setup guidelines to support NM translation from bench to bedside, the gap is still hardly overcome by main nanomedicines. One lever for filling this gap is a better characterization, thus increasing the global knowledge about the NM itself but also validate the confidence in terms of batch to batch reproducibility of such complex nano-objects. Here, we review the current methodologies routinely used for clinical release of nanomedicine batches in compliance with official guidelines.

392,"The Drosophila melanogaster white-eyed w1118 line serves as a parental stock, allowing genetic recombination of any gene of interest along with a readily recognizable marker. w1118 flies display behavioral susceptibility to environmental stimulation such as light. It is of great importance to characterize the behavioral performance of w1118 flies because this would provide a baseline from which the effect of the gene of interest could be differentiated. Little work has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w1118 flies. Here we show that pulsed light stimulation increased the regularity of walking trajectories of w1118 flies in circular arenas. We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures. Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of crossing over the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed light stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect of mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic light stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w1118 flies and an unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying w1118 isogenic background.",29454066,2018,Walking behavior in a circular arena modified by pulsed light stimulation in Drosophila melanogaster w1118 line.
393,"A large number of animal models are currently used in appetite and obesity research. Because the worldwide incidence of obesity continues to climb, it is imperative that animal models sharing characteristics of human obesity and its co-morbidities be used appropriately in the quest for novel preventions or treatments. There is probably no animal model, at least in rodents, that recapitulates all aspects of ""common"" human obesity and its comorbidities, but rodent models allow insight into specific mechanisms of disease or its consequences. Frequently used obesity models can be partitioned into different categories, the major ones being a) based on mutations or manipulations of one or a few individual genes or b) those in genetically intact animals exposed to obesogenic environments such as, e.g., being maintained on high-fat diets or being raised in small litters. Characteristics of these models include distinct phenotypes of obesity, hyperphagia or changes in energy metabolism, and frequent comorbidities of obesity, like hyperglycemia, insulin resistance or diabetes-like syndromes. This review which is based on a presentation given during the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior in July 2017 points out some observations and characteristics of rodent models in obesity and diabetes research. The choice of rodent models discussed here is subjective and based on the author's own experience or on fruitful discussions with colleagues about the pros and cons of specific models. Hence, this review, by no means, is meant to give a complete picture of rodent models used in this type of research, but the review tries to bring up some issues which, in the author's mind, may also be relevant for models not discussed here. For example, by discussing specific mouse and rat models, similarities and differences between mice and rats will be discussed that need to be considered to interpret experimental findings cautiously and in the context of the respective animal model. Knowing which animal model to use means, knowing its limitations.",29454067,2018,Considering our methods: Methodological issues with rodent models of appetite and obesity research.
394,"BACKGROUND & AIMS
Aberrant oncogenic mRNA translation and protein O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) are general features during tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, whether and how these two pathways are interlinked remain unknown. Our previous study indicated that ribosomal RACK1 promoted the chemoresistance and growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to examine the role of RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation in oncogene translation and HCC carcinogenesis.


METHODS
The site(s) of RACK1 for O-GlcNAcylation was mapped by Mass spectrometry analysis. HCC cell lines were employed to examine the effects of RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation on the translation of oncogenic factors and behaviors of tumor cells in vitro. Transgenic knock-in mice were used to detect the role of RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation in modulating HCC tumorigenesis in vivo. The correlation of RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation with tumor progression and relapse were analyzed in clinical HCC samples.


RESULTS
We found that ribosomal RACK1 was highly modified by O-GlcNAc at Ser122. O-GlcNAcylation of RACK1 enhanced its protein stability, ribosome binding and interaction with PKCβII, leading to increased eIF4E phosphorylation and translation of potent oncogenes in HCC cells. Genetic ablation of RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation at Ser122 dramatically suppressed tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis in vitro and in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. Increased RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation was also observed in HCC patient samples and correlated with tumor development and recurrence after chemotherapy.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings demonstrate that RACK1 acts as key mediator linking O-GlcNAc metabolism to cap-dependent translation during HCC tumorigenesis. Targeting RACK1 O-GlcNAcylation provides promising means for HCC treatment.",29454068,2018,O-GlcNAcylation of RACK1 promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
395,"Neighborhood conditions may have an important impact on physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the older population. Most previous studies in this area are cross-sectional and report mixed findings regarding the effects of neighborhood environment on different types of physical activity. Moreover, little is known about the prospective relationship between neighborhood environment and sedentary behaviors. Our analysis included 136,526 participants from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (age 51-70). Neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation was measured with an index based on census variables and developed using principal component analysis. Physical activity and sedentary behaviors were measured both at baseline (1995-1996) and follow-up (2004-2006). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the prospective relationship between neighborhood deprivation and exercise, non-exercise physical activity, and sedentary behaviors, adjusting for baseline physical activity and sedentary behaviors as well as potential confounders. We found that more severe neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation was prospectively associated with reduced time for exercise (β Q5 vs Q1 (95% confidence interval), hour, -0.85 (-0.95, -0.75)) but increased time spent in non-exercise physical activities (1.16 (0.97, 1.34)), such as household activities, outdoor chores, and walking for transportation. Moreover, people from more deprived neighborhoods were also more likely to engage in prolonged (≥5 h/day) TV viewing (Odds ratio Q5 vs Q1 (95% confidence interval), 1.21 (1.15, 1.27)). In conclusion, neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation is associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in the older population.

396,"To increase capacities and control over health, it is necessary to foster assets (i.e. factors enhancing abilities of individuals or communities). Acting as a buffer, assets build foundations for overcoming adverse conditions and improving health. However, little is known about the distribution of assets and their associations with social position and health. In this study, we documented the distribution of health assets and examined whether these assets moderate associations between adverse social position and self-reported health. A representative population-based cross-sectional survey of adults in the Eastern Townships, Quebec, Canada (n = 8737) was conducted in 2014. Measures included assets (i.e. resilience, sense of community belonging, positive mental health, social participation), self-reported health (i.e. perceived health, psychological distress), and indicators of social position. Distribution of assets was studied in relation to gender and social position. Logistic regressions examined whether each asset moderated associations between adverse social position and self-reported health. Different distributions of assets were observed with different social positions. Women were more likely to participate in social activities while men were more resilient. Resilience and social participation were moderators of associations between adverse social position (i.e. living alone, lower household income) and self-reported health. Having assets contributes to better health by increasing capacities. Interventions that foster assets and complement current public health services are needed, especially for people in unfavorable situations. Health and social services decision-makers and practitioners could use these findings to increase capacities and resources rather than focusing primarily on preventing diseases and reducing risk factors.",29454078,2018,Looking for capacities rather than vulnerabilities: The moderating effect of health assets on the associations between adverse social position and health.
397,"Rats exposed to unexpected reward loss increase voluntary oral consumption of ethanol. Such consumption has been assumed to attenuate loss-induced negative affect (called emotional self-medication). To test this assumption, food-deprived male Wistar rats were exposed to 10 sessions of access to 32% sucrose followed by 5 sessions of access to 4% sucrose (reward downshift). A two-bottle preference test was initiated immediately after each consummatory session to assess ethanol intake. The experimental group received access to 2% ethanol and water, whereas the control group received access to two water bottles. On sessions 11, 12, and 15, immediately after the preference test, animals were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) for signs of anxiety. Sucrose consumption was reduced after the 32-to-4% sucrose downshift on sessions 11 and 12, but behavior recovered by session 15. Consummatory suppression was followed by increased ethanol intake in the preference test after sessions 11 and 12, but intake was reduced to preshift levels by session 15; no changes were observed in water controls. Finally, general activity (closed-arm entries and total arm entries) in the EPM increased in the ethanol group on session 12, but not on session 15, relative to water controls. The increase in ethanol consumption induced by reward downshift had measurable effects on activity as assessed in the EPM. These results show that voluntary oral 2% ethanol consumption after reward downshift can affect subsequent behavior, but fall short of providing unambiguous evidence that such ethanol consumption reduces negative affect.",29454084,2018,Augmented voluntary consumption of ethanol induced by reward downshift increases locomotor activity of male Wistar rats in the elevated plus maze.
398,"Although the possibility of using drug-loaded ophthalmic lens to promote sustained drug release has been thoroughly pursued, there are still problems to be solved associated to the different alternatives. In this work, we went back to the traditional method of drug loading by soaking in the drug solution and tried to optimize the release profiles by changing the temperature and the time of loading. Two materials commercially available under the names of CI26Y and Definitive 50 were chosen. CI26Y is used for intraocular lenses (IOLs) and Definitive 50 for soft contact lenses (SCLs). Three drugs were tested: an antibiotic, moxifloxacin, and two anti-inflammatories, diclofenac and ketorolac. Sustained drug release from CI26Y disks for, at least 15 days, was obtained for moxifloxacin and diclofenac increasing the loading temperature up to 60 °C or extending the loading time till two months. The sustained release of ketorolac was limited to about 8 days. In contrast, drug release from Definitive 50 disks could not be improved by changing the loading conditions. An attempt to interpret the impact of the loading conditions on the drug release behavior was done using solid-state NMR and differential scanning calorimetry. These studies suggested the establishment of reversible, endothermic interactions between CI26Y and the drugs, moxifloxacin and diclofenac. The loading temperature had a slight effect on the mechanical and optical properties of drug loaded CI26Y samples, which still kept adequate properties to be used as IOL materials. The in vivo efficacy of CI26Y samples, drug loaded at 60 °C for two weeks, was predicted using a simplified mathematical model to estimate the drug concentration in the aqueous humor. The estimated concentrations were found to comply with the therapeutic needs, at least, for moxifloxacin and diclofenac.",29454097,2018,Improving sustained drug delivery from ophthalmic lens materials through the control of temperature and time of loading.
399,"There is now converging evidence from studies in animals and humans that the medial temporal lobes (MTLs) harbor anatomically distinct processing pathways for object and scene information. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans suggest that this domain-specific organization may be associated with a functional preference of the anterior-lateral part of the entorhinal cortex (alErC) for objects and the posterior-medial entorhinal cortex (pmErC) for scenes. As MTL subregions are differentially affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases, the question was raised whether aging may affect the 2 pathways differentially. To address this possibility, we developed a paradigm that allows the investigation of object memory and scene memory in a mnemonic discrimination task. A group of young (n = 43) and healthy older subjects (n = 44) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings during this novel task, while they were asked to discriminate exact repetitions of object and scene stimuli from novel stimuli that were similar but modified versions of the original stimuli (""lures""). We used structural magnetic resonance images to manually segment anatomical components of the MTL including alErC and pmErC and used these segmented regions to analyze domain specificity of functional activity. Across the entire sample, object processing was associated with activation of the perirhinal cortex (PrC) and alErC, whereas for scene processing, activation was more predominant in the parahippocampal cortex and pmErC. Functional activity related to mnemonic discrimination of object and scene lures from exact repetitions was found to overlap between processing pathways and suggests that while the PrC-alErC pathway was more involved in object discrimination, both pathways were involved in the discrimination of similar scenes. Older adults were behaviorally less accurate than young adults in discriminating similar lures from exact repetitions, but this reduction was equivalent in both domains. However, this was accompanied by significantly reduced domain-specific activity in PrC in older adults compared to what was observed in the young. Furthermore, this reduced domain-specific activity was associated to worse performance in object mnemonic discrimination in older adults. Taken together, we show the fine-grained functional organization of the MTL into domain-specific pathways for objects and scenes and their mnemonic discrimination and further provide evidence that aging might affect these pathways in a differential fashion. Future experiments will elucidate whether the 2 pathways are differentially affected in early stages of Alzheimer's disease in relation to amyloid or tau pathology.",29454154,2018,Age-related functional changes in domain-specific medial temporal lobe pathways.

It has been documented that anxiety and depression are prevalent in patients with asthma and are associated with greater frequency of exacerbations, increased use of health-care resources, and poor asthma control.


OBJECTIVES
Our study examined not only the association of asthma diagnosis with symptoms of depression/anxiety and asthma control at baseline, but also over a 6-month period of specialist supervision.


METHODS
We enrolled 3,182 patients with moderate-severe asthma. All were evaluated with spirometry, ACT, and HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at baseline and at 6 months. Treatments were decided by specialists according to published guidelines.


RESULTS
At baseline, 24.2% and 12% of patients were diagnosed with anxiety and depression, respectively, according to HADS. After 6 months, anxiety and depression improved, affecting 15.3% and 8.1% of patients, respectively (p<0.001); mean FEV1 and asthma control also improved (FEV1 from 81.6±20.9% to 86±20.8%; ACT from 15.8 ±4.7 to 19.4± 4.4; both p<0.001). Patients with anxiety and depression used significantly more health-care resources and had more exacerbations. A multivariate analysis showed that patients with anxiety, depression, and lower FEV1 (OR 0.20, 0.34, 0.62; p<.001, respectively) were independently associated with poor asthma control. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that anxiety had a nearly four-fold greater influence over asthma control than depression (0.326 / 0.85 = 4.075) CONCLUSIONS: Under standardized asthma care and after a specific visit with the specialist, patients present significant improvement in these psychological disorders and exhibit better asthma control and functional parameters.",29454162,2018,"Anxiety, depression, and asthma control: Changes after standardized treatment."
401,"BACKGROUND
Studies have reliably identified an association between suicide attempts and executive functions such as decision making (DM) and inhibitory control (IC) in patients with mood disorders. As such, the present study aimed to investigate the association between inhibition, DM, impulsivity and the history of suicide attempts in individuals with bipolar (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD), identifying which assessment instruments may be most strongly associated with suicide in clinical samples.


METHODS
The sample included 80 control subjects and two groups of patients with BD and MDD, matched by age and education (26 with a history of suicide attempts [MD+], and 26 with no such history [MD-]). Participants completed behavioral and self-report measures of DM and IC, which were compared between groups using ANCOVA, followed by logistic regression for patients with mood disorders only, and the presence or absence of a history of suicide as the outcome.


RESULTS
Cognitive performance did not differ between groups. The MD+ group showed significantly higher motor and attentional impulsivity on the BIS-11 than the MD- and control groups. A regression analysis containing these scores showed that motor impulsivity was the only significant predictor of a history of suicide (OR = 1.14; 95%CI 1.00-1.30).


CONCLUSIONS
Self-reported motor impulsivity was a significant predictor of suicide. These findings underscore the importance of self-report measures in neuropsychological assessment, and their contributions to the management and prognosis of patients with mood disorders. Lastly, they point to the role of impulsivity as a target for interventions and public policy on suicide prevention.",29454164,2018,Self-reported inhibition predicts history of suicide attempts in bipolar disorder and major depression.

In the United States, the prevalence of tobacco use among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) is higher compared to their non-SGM counterparts. Tobacco harm perceptions have gone largely unexamined as a potential mechanism supporting disproportionate tobacco use among this population. The purpose of this study was to examine differences between SGM and non-SGM young adults in harm perceptions of various tobacco products and tobacco use behavior and whether low tobacco-related harm perceptions moderate the relationship between identifying as a SGM and tobacco use behavior.


METHODS
This study used data from Wave 10 of the Truth Initiative Young Adult Cohort Study, a sample of U.S. young adults (ages 18-34). Data were collected from September to October 2016 and the study sample included 3089 individuals. Demographics, past 30-day use of cigarettes, little cigars/cigarillos/bidis and electronic cigarettes were assessed. Absolute and relative harm perceptions of these products were also examined.


RESULTS
Identifying as a SGM and low tobacco harm perceptions were found to be positively associated with past 30-day tobacco use. There was no interaction between SGM status and harm perceptions on past 30-day tobacco use CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm that SGM young adults continue to disproportionately use tobacco products, compared to non-SGM young adults.

Most of the tested compounds showed a good inhibitor activity with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, with two of them (1b and 1j) exhibiting also high selectivity toward HO-2. These results were obtained by the idea of potholing the entire volume of the principal hydrophobic western region with an appropriate ligand volume. Molecular modeling studies showed that these molecules bind to the HO-1 in the consolidated fashion where the imidazolyl moiety coordinates the heme iron while the aromatic groups are stabilized by hydrophobic interaction in the western region of the binding pocket.

404,"PURPOSE
This study is intended to provide an overview of diagnostic and treatment services for patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) across China.


METHODS
Using a questionnaire devised by the PNES Task Force of Neuropsychiatry Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), we conducted a survey among Chinese health professionals at the Sixth Advanced International Course: Clinical Epileptology. Descriptive analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Responses from 102 eligible clinicians were analysed. Responses were received from urban areas in 20 provinces/municipalities around China. Most respondents were neurologists. The results showed that hospitals in urban China were mostly well-equipped, and that health professionals' understanding of PNES largely reflected current international expert opinion. However, many of the participants would not actually make the diagnosis, and most provided neither follow-up nor treatment (especially psychotherapy) for patients with PNES. Only about one third of the patients diagnosed with PNES were estimated to receive at least one appointment for psychological treatment. In the opinion of the respondents, tacit trauma (neglect and stress) play an important role in the development of PNES. The main obstacles to patients with PNES accessing health services for their condition were thought to be lack of knowledge or awareness among health professionals, patients and society.

Because HIV-infected youth are at high risk of STIs and little is known about the impact of STIs on immune activation in HIV-infected youth, we conducted an exploratory study examining the association between STIs and systemic inflammation and immune activation among HIV-infected adolescents.


STUDY DESIGN
Forty-nine behaviorally infected U.S. youth ages 18-24 years with baseline CD4+ T-cells >350 who maintained viral suppression on therapy by week 48 were included. Evaluation for STIs (herpes simplex virus [HSV], Chlamydia trachomatis, syphilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) was conducted as standard of care and reported on case report forms. Measures of T-cell subsets, systemic immune activation, and soluble factors were examined at week 48 for differences between participants with an STI diagnosis during the 48 weeks compared to those without an STI.


RESULTS
Forty-three participants (88%) were male; 57% had baseline CD4+ T-cell counts >500 cells/mm3. Eighteen youth were reported to have ≥1 STI. At week 48, participants with STIs demonstrated lower CD4+ T-cell counts (any STI vs. no STI, p = 0.024; HSV vs. no STI, p = 0.022) and evidence of increased systemic immune activation, including higher CD57 intensity, higher HLA-DR intensity, and lower CD28 percentage, when compared to those without STIs. There were no differences in soluble factors between STI groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Results indicate novel activation of CD4+ T-cells among HIV-infected youth who have STIs other than HSV, which may contribute to disease progression.",29454196,2018,Sexually transmitted infections and immune activation among HIV-infected but virally suppressed youth on antiretroviral therapy.
406,"Current traffic law enforcement places an emphasis on reducing accident risk from human factors such as drunk driving and speeding. Among the various strategies implemented, demerit points and license sanction systems have been widely used as punitive and educational measures. Limitations, however, exist in previous studies in terms of estimating the interaction effects of demerit points and license sanctions. To overcome such limitations, this work focused on identifying the interaction effects of demerit points and license sanctions on driver traffic violation behavior. The interaction deterrent effects were assessed by using a Cox's proportional hazard model to provide a more accurate and unbiased estimation. For this purpose, five years of driver conviction data was obtained from the Korea National Police Agency (KNPA). This data included personal characteristics, demerit point accumulation and license sanction status. The analysis showed that accumulated demerit points had specific deterrent effects. Additionally, license revocation showed consistent and significant deterrent effects, greater than those for suspension. Male drivers under their 30s holding a motorcycle license were identified as the most violation-prone driver group, suggesting that stricter testing for the acquisition of a motorcycle driver's license is needed.",29454240,2018,Deterrent effects of demerit points and license sanctions on drivers' traffic law violations using a proportional hazard model.
407,"OBJECTIVE
To estimate the prevalence of frailty in older adults in the IMIAS population, to examine associations between lifelong domestic violence and frailty and possible pathways to explain these associations.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study with 2002 men and women in the International Mobility in Aging Study, aged between 65 and 74 years old living in five cities of Tirana (Albania), Natal (Brazil), Kingston and Saint-Hyacinthe (Canada), and Manizales (Colombia). Domestic physical and psychological violence by family and intimate partner was assessed by the Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream (HITS) scale. Fried's phenotype was adopted to define frailty. Logistic regressions were fitted to estimate between frailty and lifelong violence. Mediation analyses using the Preacher and Hayes method was used to examine potential health pathways.


RESULTS
Frailty prevalence varies across cities, being lowest in Saint-Hyacinthe and Kingston, and highest in women in Natal. Women had a higher prevalence in Tirana and Natal. Adjusting for age, sex, education and research city, those reporting childhood physical abuse (CPA) had higher odds of frailty (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.01; 2.78); those who had been exposed to psychological violence by their intimate partner had also higher odds of frailty (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.37; 3.12). CPA effect on frailty was totally mediated by chronic conditions and depression symptoms. Effects of psychological violence by intimate partner were partially mediated by chronic conditions and depression symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Childhood physical abuse and psychological violence during adulthood leave marks on life trajectory, being conducive to adverse health outcomes and frailty in old age.",29454241,2018,Frailty and life course violence: The international mobility in aging study.

409,"PURPOSE
This was a phase-II, randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled study aimed to evaluate neurocognitive effects of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with refractory focal-onset seizures (FOS).


METHODS
Children (6-16years old) with FOS were randomized (2:1) to ESL or placebo. Treatment started at 10mg/kg/day, was up-titrated up to 30mg/kg/day (target dose), and maintained for 8weeks, followed by one-year open-label follow-up. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to the end of maintenance period in the composite Power of Attention assessed with the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) system. Behavioral and emotional functioning and quality of life (QOL), secondary endpoints, were assessed with Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM). Efficacy was evaluated through changes in standardized seizure frequency (SF), responder rate, and proportion of seizure-free patients. Safety was evaluated by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).


RESULTS
One hundred and twenty-three patients were randomized. A noninferiority analysis failed to reject the null hypothesis that the change from baseline in the Power of Attention score in the ESL group was at least 121ms inferior to the placebo group for all age groups. The CDR scores showed no differences between placebo and ESL in Power of Attention (1868.0 vs 1759.5), Continuity of Attention (1.136 vs -1.786), Quality of Working Memory (-0.023 vs -0.024), and Speed of Memory (-263.4 vs -249.6). Nonsignificant differences between placebo and ESL were seen for CHQ-PF50, CBCL scores, and Raven's SPM. Episodic Memory Index showed significant negative effect on ESL. Efficacy results favored the ESL group (SF least square [LS] means 1.98 vs 4.29). The TEAEs had a similar incidence between treatment groups (41.0% vs 47.5%).

Additionally, ESL was effective in reducing seizure frequency and was well-tolerated.",29454255,2018,Effects of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate on neurocognitive functioning in children with refractory focal-onset seizures.
410,"Neuroinflammation is documented to be the major culprit of Alzheimer's disease. Lycopene (LYC), a fat soluble carotenoid, exhibits neuroprotective function in several neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effects of LYC to countering systemic inflammation-induced amyloidogenesis and memory deficiency remain to be elucidated. In current study, 3-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were treated with 0.03% LYC (w/w, mixed into normal chow) for 5 weeks. The mice were then treated by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.25mg/kg) for 9 days. It was found that LYC inhibited LPS-induced memory loss by behavior tests including Y-maze test and Morris water test. Meanwhile, LYC prevented LPS-induced accumulation of Aβ, levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and suppressed neuronal β-secretase BACE1 and elevated the expressions of α-secretase ADAM10. Furthermore, LYC down-regulated the expression of IBA-1 (a marker of microglia activation), reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators and inhibited oxidative stress in LPS-treated mice. Moreover, LYC suppressed the phosphorylation of MAPKs, NFκB, and activated Nrf2 signaling pathways in LPS-treated BV2 microglial cells. Therefore, our study indicated that LYC could ameliorate LPS-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairments possibly through mediating MAPKs, NFκB and Nrf2 signaling pathways, indicating that LYC might be a nutritional preventive strategy in neuroinflammation-related diseases such as AD.",29454265,2018,Supplementation of lycopene attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairments via mediating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
411,"Cd-induced stress response of Phanerochaete chrysosporium during the biodegradation of BDE-47 was investigated in this study, with the goal of elucidating the tolerance behavior and the detoxification mechanisms of P. chrysosporium to resist the Cd stress in the course of BDE-47 biodegradation, which has implications for expanding the application of P. chrysosporium in the bioremediation of Cd and BDE-47 combined pollution. The results suggested that single BDE-47 exposure did not induce obvious oxidative stress in P. chrysosporium, but coexistent Cd significantly triggered ROS generation, both intracellular ROS level and H2O2 content showed positive correlation with Cd concentration. The activities of SOD and CAT were enhanced by low level of Cd (≤ 1 mg/L), but Cd of higher doses (＞1 mg/L) depressed the expression of these two antioxidant enzymes at the later exposure period (3-5 days). The intracellular content of GSH along with GSH/GSSG ratio also exhibited a bell-shaped response with a maximum value at Cd of 1 mg/L. Furthermore, Cd-induced ROS generation resulted in the lipid peroxidation, as indicated by a noticeable increment of MDA content found after 3 days. Moreover, the study also indicated that Cd less than 1 mg/L promoted the production of extracellular protein and quickened the decrease of pH value in the medium, while excessive Cd (＞1 mg/L) would lead to inhibition. These findings obtained demonstrated that P. chrysosporium had a certain degree of tolerance to Cd within a specific concentration range via regulating the antioxidant levels, inducing the synthesis of extracellular protein as well as stimulating the production of organic acids, and 1 mg/L is suggested to be the tolerance threshold of this strains under Cd stress during BDE-47 biodegradation.",29454270,2018,"Cadmium-induced stress response of Phanerochaete chrysosporium during the biodegradation of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47)."
412,"BACKGROUND
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but serious psychiatric disorder, but current treatments are inadequate for approximately half of the patients with MDD. Thus, better methods of treatment are urgently needed. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like effects and potential mechanism of Apocynum venetum leaf extract (AVLE) in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The CUMS rat model of depression was used to investigate the antidepressant-like activity and relevant mechanism of AVLE (30, 60, and 125 mg/kg, i.g.). Behavioral tests, including sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), and forced swimming test (FST) were conducted to assess anhedonic, despairing, and spontaneous behaviors, respectively. The activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was evaluated by measuring the serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) concentrations. The underlying mechanism was further explored by assessing oxidative stress parameters, cell apoptosis, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the rat hippocampus exposed to CUMS.


RESULTS
The AVLE (36, 60, 125 mg/kg) treatment exerted antidepressant-like effects in CUMS-exposed rats similar to fluoxetine (10 mg/kg). The AVLE treatment reduced the serum CORT and ACTH levels in CUMS rats. It also increased the activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) and decreased the ROS generation levels and the lipid peroxidation marker MDA in the rat hippocampus subjected to CUMS. Additionally, it suppressed the apoptosis of hippocampus cells by modulating Bcl-2/Bax pathways and improved the hippocampal BDNF expressions of CUMS rats.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggested that AVLE exerted antidepressant-like effects in CUMS rats, which was possibly mediated by the prevention of oxidative stress, the inhibition of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and the upregulation of the hippocampal BDNF level.",29454288,2018,Apocynum venetum leaf extract reverses depressive-like behaviors in chronically stressed rats by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis.
413,"BACKGROUND
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an essential skill and ethical obligation for all practicing health professions clinicians because of its strong association with improved health outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that faculty who prepare these clinicians lack proficiency to teach EBP.


OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study was to describe; 1) health profession faculty beliefs about and confidence in their ability to teach and implement EBP, 2) use of EBP for education, 3) organizational culture and readiness for EBP; and to determine whether relationships exist among these variables.


DESIGN
This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive survey design.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
College of Nursing (CON) and College of Health Professions (CHP) faculty from a university located in the Northeast, United States. Faculty were defined as anyone teaching a course for the CON or CHP during the fall of 2016.


METHODS
Faculty were invited to complete an electronic survey measuring EBP beliefs, EBP use, and EBP organizational culture and readiness. The survey was comprised of three tools developed specifically for health professions educators in 2010 by Fineout-Overholt & Melnyk.


RESULTS
Sixty-nine faculty returned usable surveys (25.5% response rate). Mean EBP beliefs score was 89.49 (SD = 10.94) indicating respondents had a firm belief in and confidence in their ability to implement and teach EBP. Mean EBP use was 32.02 (SD = 20.59) indicating that respondents taught and implemented EBP between 1 and 3 times in the last 8-weeks. Mean EBP culture and readiness score was 90.20 (SD = 15.23) indicating essential movement toward a sustainable culture of college-wide integration of EBP. Mean scores for beliefs/confidence were higher for full-time clinical faculty compared to other groups [F(2, 55) = 0.075, p = 0.928; ηp2 = 0.003)]. Adjunct faculty reported higher EBP behaviors expected by health profession educators in the last 8-weeks compared to other groups [F(2, 55) = 0.251, p = 0.779; ηp2. =0.009)]. Adjunct faculty had the highest mean scores on OCRSIEP-E followed by full-time clinical faculty. These group differences in OCRSIEP-E were statistically significant [F(2, 49) = 7.92, p = 0.001; ηp2 = 0.244)]. OCRSIEP-E was significantly different between full-time tenure/tenure track faculty (M = 78.0, SD = 12.58) and full-time clinical faculty (M = 91.37, SD = 14.79, p = 0.027) and between full-time tenure/tenure track faculty and adjunct faculty (M = 97.19, SD = 12.39, p = 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Faculty adoption of EBP as a foundational pillar of teaching is essential. Research is needed to define the scope of the problem internationally. Organizations need to set standards for faculty teaching in the health professions to be EBP proficient.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a coactivator of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and required for NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory responses. Here we evaluated PARP inhibition as a means of suppressing post-stroke inflammation and improving outcome after stroke. Rats were subjected to bilateral carotid occlusion-reperfusion, and treatment with the PARP inhibitor N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide (PJ34) was begun 48 h later. PJ34 was found to rapidly suppress the ischemia-induced microglial activation and astrogliosis. Behavioral tests performed 6 to 8 weeks after ischemia showed deficits in spatial memory and learning that were lessened by the PJ34 treatment. Immunohistochemical evaluation of hippocampus at 8 weeks after ischemia showed increased neuronal density in CA1 layer of PJ34-treated animals relative to vehicle-treated animals. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling showed formation of new neurons in hippocampal CA1 area in PJ34-treated animals, but not in vehicle-treated animals.

1,"PURPOSE
The purpose of the study was to examine the association between spirituality and depression among patients with type 2 diabetes.


METHODS
This study included 201 adult participants with diabetes from an indigent clinic of an academic medical center. Participants completed validated surveys on spirituality and depression. The Daily Spiritual Experience (DSE) Scale measured a person's perception of the transcendent (God, the divine) in daily life. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale assessed depression. Linear regression analyses examined the association of spirituality as the predictor with depression as the outcome, adjusted for confounding variables.


RESULTS
Greater spirituality was reported among females, non-Hispanic blacks, those with lower educational levels, and those with lower income. The unadjusted regression model showed greater spirituality was associated with less depression. This association was mildly diminished but still significant in the final adjusted model. Depression scores also increased (greater depression risk) with females and those who were unemployed but decreased with older age and non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity.


CONCLUSIONS
Treatment of depression symptoms may be facilitated by incorporating the spiritual values and beliefs of patients with diabetes.

2,"PURPOSES
The purposes of this study were to assess differences in lifestyle behaviors and other health-related factors between black and white adults with pre-diabetes and to identify predictors for lifestyle behaviors.


METHODS
Using the 2007 and 2009 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual cross-sectional survey of randomly selected samples from each state, black (n = 1156) and white (n = 9539) adults with pre-diabetes were compared on lifestyle behaviors, general health practices, perceptions of health, chronic diseases, and access to care. Predictors for participating in regular physical activity and adequate intake of fruits and vegetables were identified for each racial and gender group using multiple regression procedures.


RESULTS
Less than 40% of the adults with pre-diabetes participated in regular physical activity, and less than a quarter had adequate intake of fruits and vegetables; only 20% met the body weight recommendations. Compared to whites, blacks were more likely to be overweight/obese (86% vs 79%) and less likely to engage in regular physical activity (29% vs 40%). Except for adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, each racial and gender group had different predictors for regular physical activity. For black males, the predictors included impaired physical health and coronary heart disease/stroke. For black females, the predictors were younger age and routine checkup.

3,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to examine the association between self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and problem-solving skills in response to detected hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia among patients with type 2 diabetes.


METHODS
Data were obtained from the American Association of Diabetes Educators Outcome System, implemented in 8 diabetes self-management education programs in western Pennsylvania. SMBG was measured by asking patients how often they checked, missed checking, or checked blood glucose later than planned. Problem-solving skill was measured by asking how often they modified their behaviors after detecting high or low blood glucose.


RESULTS
Most patients checked their blood glucose at least once per day. However, when blood glucose was high or low, many of them reported doing nothing, and only some of them resolved the problem. There were significant associations between self-monitoring of blood glucose and problem-solving skills for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and time since diagnosis.

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a short-duration, culturally tailored, community-based diabetes self- management program (CTCDSP) for Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes delivered at a non-clinic-affiliated community center.


METHODS
Forty-one Korean adults with type 2 diabetes participated in a 2-session CTCDSP delivered by a bilingual nurse practitioner at a Korean community center. Outcome measures included biological, behavioral, and general health well-being; diabetes knowledge; and self-efficacy assessed at baseline, post-education, and 3-month follow-up. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to explore mean differences in outcomes across the 3 assessment points.


RESULTS
From baseline to 3-month follow-up assessment, participants exhibited significant improvement on several physiological and behavioral measures. Mean levels of hemoglobin A1c and waist circumference decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein levels increased. Additionally, participants reported an increase in weekly feet checks, and there was a trend increase in participants' reported frequency of exercise activities. The feasibility of the CTCDSP was established, and participant satisfaction with the program was high.

5,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between magnitude of weight loss and improvement in percentage A1C (A1C%) among overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing weight reduction.


METHODS
Case records of patients enrolled in 2 university-based weight management programs were reviewed. Patients were sampled if they had a diagnosis of DM and had at least 1 documented A1C% reduction from their baseline value. Weight loss treatment was individualized and consisted of a calorie-restricted diet, a behavior modification plan, and a plan for increasing physical activity. Patient weights were measured at bimonthly visits. A1C% was measured every 3 months.


RESULTS
Seventy-two patients formed the study cohort. Mean baseline body mass index was 35.1 kg/m(2), mean age was 52.6 years, and 59% were males. Mean starting A1C% was 8.6. Patients achieved significant mean weight loss (10.7 kg) at study exit. Weight loss of 6.5 kg (4.5% of baseline body weight), 12.2 kg (8.7%), and 15.9 kg (10.3%) was required to reduce A1C% by 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively, and it took a mean of 5.6, 8.7, and 10.1 months, respectively, to achieve this. After adjustment for antidiabetic medication intake, for every 10% weight loss, the predicted reduction in A1C% was 0.81.


CONCLUSIONS

6,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study is to assess factors related to diabetes medication nonadherence in a sample of predominantly Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin adults residing along the US-Mexico border.


METHODS
As part of a randomized controlled trial, 302 patients randomly sampled from a clinic roster completed a baseline interview. Medication nonadherence was assessed with the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Consistent with the framework proposed by Venturini et al, four factors were examined: patient-related attributes, drug regimen characteristics and complexity, health status, and patient-provider interaction characteristics.


RESULTS
Sixty percent of the patients were classified as nonadherent. Men, those who engaged in diabetes control behaviors less frequently, and individuals with depression were more likely to be classified as nonadherent. Among those who were Spanish-dominant, education and self-rated health also were significantly and negatively related to medication adherence; patients with a high school education or greater and those who more positively rated their health were more likely to be classified as nonadherent compared to those with less than a high school education and those who rated their health as poor.


CONCLUSIONS
Results reflect potentially higher medication nonadherence rates for Latinos with type 2 diabetes living in rural communities along the US-Mexico border. Additionally, this study supports the need to address strategies to support medication adherence, including addressing depression, for diabetes control.

7,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in terms of how youths conceptualized the effect of T2DM on daily life, adjustment to the illness, and motivation related to diabetes self-care management. The aims of the study were to gather essential information in order to develop appropriate intervention techniques and inform future studies intended to understand the psychosocial experiences of youths with T2DM.


METHODS
Eight adolescents diagnosed with T2DM were recruited from an outpatient pediatric diabetes clinic at a Midwestern children's hospital. A qualitative interview was developed, which was scheduled to last about 30 to 45 minutes. Data were analyzed using the consensual qualitative research methodology, wherein qualitative coders developed core ideas and themes related to the adolescent experience of T2DM.


RESULTS
Three main themes were identified, including how the youths conceptualized the impact of T2DM, adjustment to self-care, and motivation to perform self-care behaviors. Knowledge related to the cause of T2DM and adjustment to completing self-care behaviors was varied among youths. Few adolescents spoke about motivation sources, although when mentioned, it typically involved witnessing negative health consequences in family members or friends with T2DM.


CONCLUSIONS
The data represent essential initial information related to youths with T2DM, which will help guide in developing future studies designed to understand the psychosocial experiences of youths with T2DM and appropriate intervention techniques.

METHODS
Women with diabetes (n = 22) in Cape Town, South Africa, participated in a 12-week program focused on providing and applying knowledge of health routines to manage diabetes. Women were linked with a buddy via a mobile phone for support and were questioned daily about a health behavior via text message. Women were assessed at recruitment and then 3 and 6 months later by a trained interviewer using a mobile phone for data collection. The women were evaluated on technology uptake, reduction of body mass index, blood glucose levels, and increases in positive coping and general health-seeking behaviors.


RESULTS
Women exchanged 16 739 text messages to buddies and received 3144 texts from the project. Women responded to 29% of texted questions (n = 1321/14 582). Women attended at least 9 of 12 possible intervention sessions; a third attended all 12 sessions (n = 8/22). Between baseline and 3 months, women increased their sleep and reported a higher level of positive action and social support coping, yet blood glucose increased by 3.3 points. From 3 to 6 months, spiritual hope decreased and diastolic blood pressure increased. One year later, the 22 women continue to attend meetings.

A systematic mixed-studies review was undertaken to review the quantitative and qualitative research on the parental experience of having a child with T1DM. A total of 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.


RESULTS
The prevalence of parental psychological distress across all studies ranged from 10% to 74%, with an average of 33.5% of parents reporting distress at diagnosis and 19% of parents reporting distress 1 to 4 years after diagnosis. Parental psychological distress in parents of children with T1DM, regardless of how it was defined, was associated with higher child self-report of stress and depressive symptoms, more problematic child behavior, and lower child self-report of quality of life. Parental psychological distress also had negative effects on diabetes management. Themes of the qualitative synthesis indicated that parents perceived T1DM as a difficult diagnosis that contributed to significant family disruption. Adjustment occurred over time; however, ongoing stress was experienced.


CONCLUSIONS
Screening for psychological distress in parents of children with T1DM is indicated, and preventive interventions are needed.",22581804,2012,Psychological experience of parents of children with type 1 diabetes: a systematic mixed-studies review.
10,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of a culturally grounded, community-based diabetes prevention program among obese Latino adolescents.


METHODS
Fifteen obese Latino adolescents (body mass index [BMI] percentile = 96.3 ± 1.1, age = 15.0 ± 0.9 years) completed a 12-week intervention that included weekly lifestyle education classes delivered by bilingual/bicultural promotoras and three, 60-minute physical activity sessions per week. Participants were assessed for anthropometrics (height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference), cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity/inactivity, nutrition behaviors, and insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.


RESULTS
The intervention resulted in significant decreases in BMI z score, BMI percentile, and waist circumference; increases in cardiorespiratory fitness; and decreases in physical inactivity and dietary fat consumption. In addition to these changes, the intervention led to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and reductions in 2-hour glucose levels.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support the feasibility and efficacy of a community-based diabetes prevention program for high-risk Latino youth. Translational approaches that are both culturally grounded and biologically meaningful represent a novel and innovative strategy for closing the obesity-related health disparities gap.",22585870,2012,Effects of a culturally grounded community-based diabetes prevention program for obese Latino adolescents.
11,"PURPOSE
The lack of research concerning treatment for individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and comorbid eating disorders (ED) contributes to the gulf between the psychosocial needs of individuals with the two conditions and the treatment they receive. Empirical evidence has established that the prognosis of patients with this comorbid diagnosis (ED-DM) is poor in the absence of a specialized DM treatment specifically adapted to ED. In individuals with DM, comorbid ED is associated with numerous complications. Despite these interactions, current knowledge about the comorbid diagnosis is limited, and eating disorders in patients with diabetes often remain undiagnosed. This article presents standard procedures for assessment and optimal therapeutic interventions for patients with ED and DM.


CONCLUSION
In patients with diabetes, problematic eating behaviors and symptoms should be assessed routinely. When an eating disorder is detected, diabetes management needs to be adapted, binge eating or medication misuse needs to be addressed, and eating disorder specialists should be included in the multidisciplinary team.",22585871,2012,Comorbid diabetes and eating disorders in adult patients: assessment and considerations for treatment.
12,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of training peers to function as lifestyle coaches and to deliver a church-based lifestyle modification program.


METHODS
We recruited 6 African-American adults to participate in an 8-hour peer lifestyle coach (PLC) training program followed by a subsequent 2-hour booster session. The PLC training program addressed several key areas, including: (1) developing empowerment-based facilitation, active listening, and behavior change skills; (2) learning self-management strategies (eg, reading food labels, counting calories); (3) practicing session delivery; and (4) interpreting clinical lab results. Training evaluation was conducted retrospectively (immediately following the delivery of the diabetes prevention intervention rather than after the 8-hour training session) and measured program satisfaction and efficacy from the perspective of participants.


RESULTS
Peer lifestyle coaches' confidence levels for performing core skills (eg, asking open-ended questions, 5-step behavioral goal-setting process) and advanced skills (eg, addressing resistance, discussing sensitive topics) were uniformly high. Similarly, PLCs were very satisfied with the length of training, balance between content and skills development, and preparation for leading group- and individual-based support activities.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest that it is feasible to customize a PLC training program that is acceptable to participants and that equips participants with the knowledge and skills to facilitate a church-based diabetes prevention intervention.",22609761,2012,Training peers to deliver a church-based diabetes prevention program.
13,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between body image, health beliefs, and health behavior in patients with diabetes classified according to body mass index (BMI).


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted in a community hospital between January and April 2010. One-hundred-sixty-eight patients with diabetes were enrolled. Main measure was the previously published and validated Health Belief Questionnaire. Data were analyzed and compared between two groups, one with BMI ≥ 24 Kg/m(2) and another with BMI < 24 Kg/m(2).


RESULTS
Perceived body image affected health behavior of patients with BMI ≥ 24 Kg/m(2) but did not affect health behavior in patients with BMI < 24 Kg/m(2). Multivariate analysis found a positive association between health behavior and appearance evaluation and between health behavior and health evaluation in high BMI group. No significant association was found between body image and health behavior in the low BMI group. Patients with high BMI had lower body image than patients with low BMI as demonstrated by results of appearance evaluation, health evaluation, prevention behavior, and benefits.


CONCLUSIONS
Perceived body image and health beliefs are associated with self-reported health behavior among patients with diabetes with BMI measurement greater than 24 Kg/m(2). Diabetes educators may apply the findings of this study and the Health Belief Questionnaire to instruct and monitor patients with diabetes about self management behaviors.",22814357,2012,Association of body image and health beliefs with health behaviors in patients with diabetes: a cross-sectional study.
14,"OBJECTIVE
To determine changes in cortical neural networks as defined by resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging during voluntary modulation of tinnitus with orofacial maneuvers.


STUDY DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


SETTING
Academic medical center.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Participants were scanned during the maneuver and also at baseline to serve as their own control. The authors chose, a priori, 58 seed regions to evaluate previously described cortical neural networks by computing temporal correlations between all seed region pairs. Seed regions whose correlations significantly differed between rest and maneuver (P < .05, uncorrected) entered into a second-stage analysis of computing the correlation coefficient between the seed region and time courses in each of the remaining brain voxels. A threshold-free cluster enhancement permutation analysis evaluated the distribution of these correlation coefficients after transformation to Fisher z scores and registration to a surface-based reconstruction using Freesurfer.


RESULTS
The median age for the 16 subjects was 54 years (range, 27-72 years), and all had subjective, unilateral or bilateral, nonpulsatile tinnitus for 6 months or longer. In 9 subjects who could voluntarily increase the loudness of their tinnitus, there were no significant differences in functional connectivity in any cortical networks. A separate analysis evaluated results from 3 patients who decreased the loudness of their tinnitus. Four subjects were excluded because of excessive motion in the scanner.


CONCLUSION
The absence of significant differences in functional connectivity due to voluntary orofacial maneuvers that increased tinnitus loudness failed to confirm prior reports of altered cerebral blood flows during somatomotor behaviors.",22675003,2012,Functional connectivity during modulation of tinnitus with orofacial maneuvers.
15,"PURPOSE
To explore the need for self-monitoring and self-care education in heart failure patients with diabetes (HF- DM patients) by describing cognitive and affective factors to provide guidance in developing effective self-management education.


METHODS
A cross-sectional correlation design was employed using baseline patient data from a study testing a 12-week patient and family dyad intervention to improve dietary and medication-taking self-management behaviors in HF patients. Data from 116 participants recruited from metropolitan Atlanta area were used. Demographic and comorbidities, physical function, psychological distress, relationship with health care provider, self-efficacy (medication taking and low sodium diet), and behavioral outcomes (medications, dietary habits) were assessed. Descriptive statistics and a series of chi-square tests, t tests, or Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare HF patients with and without DM.


RESULTS
HF-DM patients were older and heavier, had more comorbidities, and took more daily medications than HF patients. High self-efficacy on medication and low-sodium diet was reported in both groups with no significant difference. Although HF-DM patients took more daily medications than HF, both groups exhibited high HF medication-taking behaviors. The HF-DM patients consumed significantly lower total sugar than HF patients but clinically higher levels of sodium.


CONCLUSIONS
Diabetes educators need to be aware of potential conflicts of treatment regimens to manage 2 chronic diseases. Special and integrated diabetes self-management education programs that incorporate principles of HF self-management should be developed to improve self-management behavior in HF-DM patients.",22722611,2012,Educational needs for improving self-care in heart failure patients with diabetes.
16,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to identify the impact that cancer and its treatment had on diabetes self-management and to identify common issues that individuals with diabetes encounter while undergoing chemotherapy.


METHODS
This exploratory study utilized a baseline self-administered written survey and an 8-week telephone follow-up survey that included 2 open-ended questions. Forty-three adults aged 50 or older with diabetes and a solid tumor cancer receiving chemotherapy were recruited from 8 community outpatient cancer centers in Michigan and Ohio. Descriptives, t tests, and correlations were utilized to analyze the data. Content analysis was used to analyze the data from the open-ended questions.


RESULTS
After a minimum of 8 weeks of chemotherapy, patients performed significantly fewer diabetes self-management behaviors. The majority of individuals experienced a moderate to high impact on their ability to perform diabetes self-management activities while receiving chemotherapy. Exercise, ability to eat and drink, and monitoring blood sugars were most affected. Three themes identifying patient issues were noted: self-management issues, health issues, and prioritization.


CONCLUSIONS
Cancer treatment and cancer-related symptoms can have a negative impact on diabetes self-management behaviors in adults with diabetes who are undergoing chemotherapy. Diabetes self-management education is targeted to improve health outcomes in patients with diabetes and cancer and addresses the ""cause"" not just the ""source"" of the problem needs to be developed. Further research needs to be done to address issues related to glycemic control and health-related outcomes in this population.",22983823,2012,Perceived impact of cancer treatment on diabetes self-management.
17,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between fatigue and physiological, psychological, and lifestyle phenomena in women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in order to establish the magnitude and correlates of fatigue in women with T2DM and explore the interrelationships between fatigue and specific diabetes-related factors that may be associated with increased levels of fatigue. These factors included physiological factors (glucose control, diabetes symptoms), psychological factors (diabetes emotional distress, depressive symptoms in general), and lifestyle factors (body mass index, physical activity).


METHODS
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. Women who reported conditions known to cause fatigue were excluded. Physiological measures included fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1C (A1C), glucose variability, and body mass index (BMI). Women completed questionnaires about health, fatigue levels, diabetes symptoms, diabetes emotional distress, depressive symptoms, physical activity, and current diabetes self-care practices. A subset of the women wore a Medtronic Gold CGM sensor for 3 days for assessment of glucose variability.


RESULTS
Eighty-three women aged 40 to 65 years with T2DM completed the study. Fatigue was significantly related to diabetes symptoms, diabetes emotional distress, depressive symptoms, higher BMI, and reduced physical activity. There was no relationship between fatigue and FBG or A1C. The strongest explanatory factors for fatigue were diabetes symptoms, depressive symptoms, and BMI, which accounted for 48% of the variance in fatigue scores. Glucose variability was not significantly associated with fatigue in these women.


CONCLUSIONS
Fatigue is a persistent clinical complaint among women with T2DM and may signal the presence of physiological, psychological, and lifestyle-related phenomena that could undermine diabetes health outcomes.",22713262,2012,Fatigue in women with type 2 diabetes.
18,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this study was to explore potential factors affecting the self-management behaviors of Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (KIT2Ds).


METHODS
A qualitative descriptive design guided this study. Semistructured interviews lasting 45 to 60 minutes were conducted with 20 KIT2Ds in the participants' preferred language; in all cases, this was Korean. Each interview was audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using conventional content analysis. Data analysis was performed in two steps. The data written in Korean were initially analyzed by 3 bilingual researchers. A qualitative researcher then participated in the analysis to refine the findings for presentation to an English-speaking audience while staying true to the data and preserving the nuanced Korean meanings.


RESULTS
The mean age of the sample was 64. 5 ± 11.6 years (9 men and 11 women). The mean years of staying in the United States and age at diabetes mellitus diagnosis were 23.6 ± 9.7 years and 52.5 ± 12.3 years, respectively. Three major ideas were identified: (1) issues on treatment regimen related to medications and diet, (2) resources that helped or hindered ability to manage diabetes, and (3) the physician-patient relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
Important cultural nuances need to be addressed to better prepare KIT2Ds to manage their diabetes more effectively. A culture-specific program should extend beyond a diabetes self-management education delivered in Korean language. Rather, content and education methods need to consider acculturation effects on diabetes management behaviors.",23019236,2012,Understanding cultural issues in the diabetes self-management behaviors of Korean immigrants.

20,"Foraging animals have distinct exploration and exploitation behaviors that are organized into discrete behavioral states. Here, we characterize a neuromodulatory circuit that generates long-lasting roaming and dwelling states in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), each initiate and extend one behavioral state. Serotonin promotes dwelling states through the MOD-1 serotonin-gated chloride channel. The spontaneous activity of serotonergic neurons correlates with dwelling behavior, and optogenetic modulation of the critical MOD-1-expressing targets induces prolonged dwelling states. PDF promotes roaming states through a Gαs-coupled PDF receptor; optogenetic activation of cAMP production in PDF receptor-expressing cells induces prolonged roaming states. The neurons that produce and respond to each neuromodulator form a distributed circuit orthogonal to the classical wiring diagram, with several essential neurons that express each molecule. The slow temporal dynamics of this neuromodulatory circuit supplement fast motor circuits to organize long-lasting behavioral states.",23972393,2013,Serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF initiate and extend opposing behavioral states in C. elegans.
21,"Most eukaryotic cells express small regulatory RNAs. The purpose of one class, the somatic endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), remains unclear. Here, we show that the endo-siRNA pathway promotes odor adaptation in C. elegans AWC olfactory neurons. In adaptation, the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3, which acts in AWC, is loaded with siRNAs targeting odr-1, a gene whose downregulation is required for adaptation. Concomitant with increased odr-1 siRNA in AWC, we observe increased binding of the HP1 homolog HPL-2 at the odr-1 locus in AWC and reduced odr-1 mRNA in adapted animals. Phosphorylation of HPL-2, an in vitro substrate of the EGL-4 kinase that promotes adaption, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral adaptation. Thus, environmental stimulation amplifies an endo-siRNA negative feedback loop to dynamically repress cognate gene expression and shape behavior. This class of siRNA may act broadly as a rheostat allowing prolonged stimulation to dampen gene expression and promote cellular memory formation.

22,"Retinal photoreceptors entrain the circadian system to the solar day. This photic resetting involves cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated upregulation of Per genes within individual cells of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Our detailed understanding of this pathway is poor, and it remains unclear why entrainment to a new time zone takes several days. By analyzing the light-regulated transcriptome of the SCN, we have identified a key role for salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in clock re-setting. An entrainment stimulus causes CRTC1 to coactivate CREB, inducing the expression of Per1 and Sik1. SIK1 then inhibits further shifts of the clock by phosphorylation and deactivation of CRTC1. Knockdown of Sik1 within the SCN results in increased behavioral phase shifts and rapid re-entrainment following experimental jet lag. Thus SIK1 provides negative feedback, acting to suppress the effects of light on the clock. This pathway provides a potential target for the regulation of circadian rhythms.",23993098,2013,The CRTC1-SIK1 pathway regulates entrainment of the circadian clock.
23,"Adiponectin is a cytokine reported as a determinant of poor prognosis in women with breast cancer. However, because data regarding its role in breast cancer have been obtained primarily from studies employing overweight or obese women, the adiponectin profile in non-obese women is poorly understood. In this study, we determined adiponectin levels in plasma from non-obese women with breast cancer and investigated a possible correlation with systemic inflammatory status. We determined the plasma adiponectin levels as well as biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in 80 women. Our results revealed that plasma adiponectin levels were affected by chemotherapy, estrogen receptor status, and disease progression. Adiponectin was positively correlated with antioxidant levels, without affecting either the metastatic behavior of disease or patient outcome. These findings highlight adiponectin as a novel player in the endocrine signaling that modulates the oxidative inflammatory response in human breast cancer, and contribute to the understanding of the role of adiponectin in pathological conditions in non-obese women.",24095646,2014,Clinical insights from adiponectin analysis in breast cancer patients reveal its anti-inflammatory properties in non-obese women.
24,"In V-style ski jumping, aerodynamic forces are predominant performance factors and athletes have to solve difficult optimization problems in parts of a second in order to obtain their jump length maximum and to keep the flight stable. Here, a comprehensive set of wind tunnel data was used for optimization studies based on Pontryagin's minimum principle with both the angle of attack α and the body-ski angle β as controls. Various combinations of the constraints αmax and βmin(t) were analyzed in order to compare different optimization strategies. For the computer simulation studies, the Olympic hill profiles in Esto-Sadok, Russia (HS 106m, HS 140m), and in Harrachov, Czech Republic, host of the Ski Flying World Championships 2014 (HS 205m) were used. It is of high importance for ski jumping practice that various aerodynamic strategies, i.e. combinations of α- and β-time courses, can lead to similar jump lengths which enables athletes to win competitions using individual aerodynamic strategies. Optimization results also show that aerodynamic behavior has to be different at different hill sizes (HS). Optimized time courses of α and β using reduced drag and lift areas in order to mimic recent equipment regulations differed only in a negligible way. This indicates that optimization results presented here are not very sensitive to minor changes of the aerodynamic equipment features when similar jump length are obtained by using adequately higher in-run velocities. However, wind tunnel measurements with athletes including take-off and transition to stabilized flight, flight, and landing behavior would enable a more detailed understanding of individual flight style optimization.",24388531,2014,"Flight style optimization in ski jumping on normal, large, and ski flying hills."
25,"Collagen is a ubiquitous protein with remarkable mechanical properties. It is highly elastic, shows large fracture strength and enables substantial energy dissipation during deformation. Most of the connective tissue in humans consists of collagen fibrils composed of a staggered array of tropocollagen molecules, which are connected by intermolecular cross-links. In this study, we report a three-dimensional coarse-grained model of collagen and analyze the influence of enzymatic cross-links on the mechanics of collagen fibrils. Two representatives immature and mature cross-links are implemented in the mesoscale model using a bottom-up approach. By varying the number, type and mechanical properties of cross-links in the fibrils and performing tensile test on the models, we systematically investigate the deformation mechanisms of cross-linked collagen fibrils. We find that cross-linked fibrils exhibit a three phase behavior, which agrees closer with experimental results than what was obtained using previous models. The fibril mechanical response is characterized by: (i) an initial elastic deformation corresponding to the collagen molecule uncoiling, (ii) a linear regime dominated by molecule sliding and (iii) the second stiffer elastic regime related to the stretching of the backbone of the tropocollagen molecules until the fibril ruptures. Our results suggest that both cross-link density and type dictate the stiffness of large deformation regime by increasing the number of interconnected molecules while cross-links mechanical properties determine the failure strain and strength of the fibril. These findings reveal that cross-links play an essential role in creating an interconnected fibrillar material of tunable toughness and strength.",25153614,2015,"Influence of cross-link structure, density and mechanical properties in the mesoscale deformation mechanisms of collagen fibrils."
26,"PURPOSE
The extent to which reducing cost-related barriers affects diabetes outcomes and medication adherence among uninsured patients is not known. The purpose of these analyses was to understand the clinical impact and cost considerations of a prescription assistance program targeting low-income, minority patients with diabetes and at high risk for cost-related medication nonadherence.


METHODS
Patients received diabetes medications without copayments for 12 months. Change in diabetes control was calculated by using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level at follow-up compared with baseline. Clinical data were collected from the electronic health record. Medication adherence for diabetes medications was estimated by using proportion of days covered (PDC). Incremental acquisition and per-patient costs, based on actual hospital medication costs, were calculated for different baseline HbA1c levels.


FINDINGS
Patients with baseline HbA1c levels ≥7%, ≥8%, and ≥9% experienced mean HbA1c reductions of 0.82% (P = 0.008), 1.02% (P = 0.010), and 1.47% (P = 0.010), respectively, during the 12-month period. The average PDC was 70.55%; 45.24% had a PDC ≥80%, indicating an adequate level of medication adherence. Medication adherence ≥80% was associated with ethnicity (P = 0.015), whereas mean PDC was associated with number of diabetes medication classes used (P = 0.031). Acquisition cost for 1242 prescriptions filled by 103 patients was $13,365.82, representing per-patient costs of $132.39; however, as baseline targets increased, acquisition costs decreased and per-patient costs increased from $10,682.59 and $169.56 to $6509.91 and $192.27, respectively.


IMPLICATIONS
Clinically significant reductions in HbA1c levels were achieved for all patients, although greater reductions were achieved with modest per-patient cost increases when considering patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Incorporating a multifactorial intervention to address cost-related medication nonadherence with a behavior change component may yield greater reductions in HbA1c with improved diabetes outcomes and meaningful hospital-based cost savings.",25282579,2014,Clinical outcomes and incremental costs from a medication adherence pilot intervention targeting low-income patients with diabetes at risk of cost-related medication nonadherence.
27,"PURPOSE
In the United States, many individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pay for their medications using private health insurance coverage. As in other drug classes, private insurers are actively seeking to influence use and costs, particularly for newer and costlier medications. The approaches that insurers use may have important effects on patients' access to medications. This article examines approaches (eg, copayments, prior authorization, and step therapy) that commercial health plans are using to manage newer medications used to treat ADHD and changes in approaches since 2003.


METHODS
Data are from a nationally representative survey of commercial health plans in 60 market areas regarding alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health services in 2010. Responses were obtained from 389 plans (89% response rate), reporting on 925 insurance products. For each of 6 branded ADHD medications, respondents were asked whether the plan covered the medication and, if so, on what copayment tier each medication was placed and whether it was subject to prior authorization or step therapy. Measures of management approach were constructed for each medication and for the group of medications. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to test for association of the management approach with various health plan characteristics.


FINDINGS
There was considerable variation across these 6 medications in how tightly they were managed by health plans, with newer medications being subject to more stringent management. The proportion of insurance products relying solely on copayment tiering to manage new ADHD medications appears to have decreased since 2003. Less than half of insurance products (43%) managed these 6 medications solely by use of tier 3 or 4 placement, and most of the remainder (48%) used other restrictions (with or without tier 3 or 4 placement). The average insurance product restricted access to at least 3 of the 6 brand-only medications examined, whether through copayment tier placement or other approaches. More ADHD medications were left unrestricted in health maintenance organization products than in preferred provider organization ones, products with internal or hybrid-internal contracts for behavioral health, those not contracting with pharmacy benefits managers, and those with for-profit ownership.


IMPLICATIONS
Many plans have supplemented copayment tiering with other approaches, such as prior authorization and step therapy, to influence use and decrease costs. It may be that plans have found copayments to be less effective in redirecting use in this medication class. The effect on clinical outcomes was not examined in this study but should be prioritized using other data sources.",25450473,2014,Management of newer medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in commercial health plans.
28,"BACKGROUND
The Massachusetts Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (MA-CORD) project is a 2-year, multilevel, multisector community intervention to prevent and control obesity among children 2-12 years of age from two predominantly low-income communities in Massachusetts. MA-CORD includes evidence-based interventions in multiple sectors, including community health centers, early care and education centers, schools, afterschool programs, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, and the broader community. Currently, implementation of MA-CORD is complete and the final year of data collection is in progress. Here, the MA-CORD evaluation plan is described and baseline data are presented.


METHODS/DESIGN
The impact of MA-CORD on children's BMI, lifestyle behaviors, obesity-related care, and quality of life will be assessed using sector-specific, pre/post, time-series, and quasi-experimental designs. Change in the primary outcomes will be compared for intervention and comparison communities. Additionally, change in mean BMI and obesity prevalence in intervention school districts will be compared to similar districts throughout the state.


RESULTS
At baseline in 2012, approximately 16% of preschool-aged and 25% of school-aged children were obese. Moreover, 15-40% of children consumed no vegetables on the previous day, 25-75% drank a sugar-sweetened beverage on the previous day, up to 87% had insufficient physical activity, 50-75% had a television in the room where they slept, and 50-80% obtained insufficient sleep.


CONCLUSIONS
There is ample room for improvement in BMI and health behaviors in children in MA-CORD communities. If successful, MA-CORD may serve as a model for multilevel, multisector approaches to childhood obesity prevention and control.",25575095,2015,Evaluation overview for the Massachusetts Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (MA-CORD) project.

Our objective was to evaluate associations between environmental and lifestyle factors and both protective dietary patterns (e.g., intake of fruits and vegetables) and harmful dietary patterns (e.g., consumption of salty snacks and fast food). Surveys were individually and orally administered to 105 foreign-born Latina mothers living in rural locations in a Midwestern state.

32,"The living and working arrangements of migrant farmworkers in North Carolina are shaped by grower provided housing, codified by the US Department of Labor's H-2A temporary worker program. Growers typically dictate all facets about residences, living conditions, and even food acquirements. Farmworker camps likely contribute to aggression because of the forced relationships among a small group of people that live, work and recreate together for extended time periods. Participants in the study consisted of 371 farmworkers living in 183 camps. The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale was used to assess aggression among migrant farmworkers. Results indicated that aggressive acts were prevalent among the farmworkers, but the frequency of aggressive acts was low. The most common aggressive act was minor psychological aggression. Results also indicated that alcohol misuse was a common characteristic for both victims and perpetrators and the majority of aggressive acts occurred later in the agricultural season.",26022146,2016,Aggression Among Male Migrant Farmworkers Living in Camps in Eastern North Carolina.
33,"This study examined the relationships among the constructs of acculturative stress, depression, English language use, health literacy, and social support and the influence of these factors on health-seeking behaviors of Filipino Australians. Using a self-administered questionnaire, 552 respondents were recruited from November 2010 to June 2011. Structural equation modelling was used to examine relationships. A direct and negative relationship between health-seeking behaviors and depression, and an indirect relationship with acculturative stress, was observed mediated through depression. Social support had an important moderating influence on these effects. Although there was an inverse relationship between age and English language usage and depression, age was positively related to health-seeking behavior. Despite their long duration of stay, Filipino Australian migrants continue to experience acculturative stress and depression leading to lower health-seeking behaviors. This study highlights the importance of screening for acculturative stress and depression in migrants and fostering social support.",26050239,2016,Health-Seeking Behaviors of Filipino Migrants in Australia: The Influence of Persisting Acculturative Stress and Depression.
34,"Entorhinal cortex (EC) projections to the hippocampus run along the perforant path and activate the hippocampal area CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG), which, in turn, drives CA3. Because cortical trauma damages the source of inputs to the hippocampus, we hypothesize that such an event can be reflected in immediate alterations of the hippocampal oscillatory activity. We here explore whether acute, localized disruption of EC-EC connectivity is involved in the generation or modulation of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the hippocampus. We conducted in vitro electrophysiological recordings in CA3 and DG of combined EC-hippocampal transversal slices prepared from intact brains and from brains with a spatially defined, transversal cut of the EC made in situ, 2h before in vitro recordings commenced. We also determined if pharmacological manipulations of the adenosine system modulated the fast oscillatory activity. EC-hippocampal slices prepared from brains, in which a transversal lesion of the EC was uni- or bilaterally conducted in situ, displayed spontaneous epileptiform events with superimposed ripples (150-250 Hz) and fast ripples (>250 Hz), whereas those obtained from non-lesioned brains did not have spontaneous HFOs. However, in the latter, high frequency stimulation applied to the perforant path produced ripple activity in area CA3. Spontaneous fast ripples were prevented by conducting the slicing procedure and incubating the slices both in a Na(+)-free medium and in a low Ca(++)-high Mg(++) medium for an hour before recording commenced, under normal Na(+) concentration. Activation of A1, but not A2, receptors produced a strong inhibition of the incidence and spectral power of fast ripples but did not change their intrinsic frequency. Our data show that the disruption of EC-to-EC connections can immediately disinhibit hippocampal CA3 area to generate HFOs on top of epileptiform events, probably constituting an irritating focus long before overt epileptic activity can be detected behaviorally. Therefore, the activation of the adenosinergic system can possibly be regarded as an immediate intervention strategy to avoid epileptogenesis.",26072121,2015,Entorhinal cortex lesions result in adenosine-sensitive high frequency oscillations in the hippocampus.
35,"BACKGROUND
The connection between religion/spirituality and deviance, like substance abuse, was first made by Durkheim who defined socially expected behaviors as norms. He explained that deviance is due in large part to their absence (called anomie), and concluded that spirituality lowers deviance by preserving norms and social bonds. Impairments in brain reward circuitry, as observed in Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS), may also result in deviance and as such we wondered if stronger belief in spirituality practice and religious belief could lower relapse from drugs of abuse.


METHODS
The NIDA Drug Addiction Treatment Outcome Study data set was used to examine post hoc relapse rates among 2,947 clients who were interviewed at 12 months after intake broken down by five spirituality measures.


RESULTS
Our main findings strongly indicate, that those with low spirituality have higher relapse rates and those with high spirituality have higher remission rates with crack use being the sole exception. We found significant differences in terms of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and marijuana relapse as a function of strength of religious beliefs (x2 = 15.18, p = 0.028; logistic regression = 10.65, p = 0.006); frequency of attending religious services (x2 = 40.78, p < 0.0005; logistic regression = 30.45, p < 0.0005); frequency of reading religious books (x2 = 27.190, p < 0.0005; logistic regression = 17.31, p < 0.0005); frequency of watching religious programs (x2 = 19.02, p = 0.002; logistic regression = ns); and frequency of meditation/prayer (x2 = 11.33, p = 0.045; logistic regression = 9.650, p = 0.002). Across the five measures of spirituality, the spiritual participants reported between 7% and 21% less alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana use than the non-spiritual subjects. However, the crack users who reported that religion was not important reported significantly less crack use than the spiritual participants. The strongest association between remission and spirituality involves attending religious services weekly, the one marker of the five that involves the highest social interaction/social bonding consistent with Durkheim's social bond theory.


CONCLUSIONS
Stronger spiritual/religious beliefs and practices are directly associated with remission from abused drugs except crack. Much like the value of having a sponsor, for clients who abuse drugs, regular spiritual practice, particularly weekly attendance at the religious services of their choice is associated with significantly higher remission. These results demonstrate the clinically significant role of spirituality and the social bonds it creates in drug treatment programs.",26052556,2015,NIDA-Drug Addiction Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS) Relapse as a Function of Spirituality/Religiosity.
36,"There is unmet contraceptive need among Haitian immigrants and Haitian-American women (Haitian women). The study explored associations of three measures of acculturation with contraceptive/reproductive health history among Haitian women residing in the Little Haiti community of Miami. This was a cross-sectional, exploratory study among 57 Haitian women. We conducted descriptive univariate analyses, then bivariate analyses to investigate the association of acculturation with reproductive health risk behavior including contraceptive use, tampon use, and parity, as well as interest in a female-initiated barrier contraceptive method. The most commonly ever-used contraceptive methods were male condoms (78.9 %) and oral contraceptives (OC 19.3 %). Women who primarily spoke Créole at home were less likely than those who did not to use OC (11.9 vs. 42.9 %, p = .01). Among women who resided in the U.S. ≥10 years, tampon use was 51.9 % compared to 16.7 % among those who were in the U.S. for less time (p = .005). Among U.S. born women, 60 % were tampon users compared to 22.7 % among those born in Haiti (p = .05). Women not speaking primarily Créole at home (p = .06) and those born in U.S. (p = .008) had fewer children. Contraceptive use was low among Haitian women but influenced by acculturation, where greater acculturation was associated with protective reproductive health behavior. Despite traditional norms discouraging contraceptive use, and little experience with female barriers, Haitian women indicated an interest in learning about and using a female-initiated barrier contraceptive. Increasing contraceptive uptake of potential multipurpose technologies is a potential point of intervention for decreasing HIV/STI transmission in this at-risk population.",26087716,2016,"An Exploratory Study of Acculturation and Reproductive Health Among Haitian and Haitian-American Women in Little Haiti, South Florida."

38,"Current instruments used to aid in the diagnosis of psychological disorders have limited effectiveness with clients from Asian backgrounds. The Vietnamese Depression Interview (VDI) is a diagnostic instrument created to assess the presence of current and lifetime history of major depressive disorder specifically among Vietnamese refugees and immigrants. The purpose of the present study is to provide a description of the VDI, while also noting it as a reliable and valid means by which to assess depression in Vietnamese individuals. Using the Longitudinal, Expert, and All Data (LEAD; Spitzer in Compr Psychiatry 24:399-411, 1983) standard and the VDI, experienced clinicians conducted the diagnosis process with 127 Vietnamese refugees and immigrants. Assessment of the reliability and validity of the VDI yielded good to excellent AUC and kappa values, indicating the reliability of the VDI and the agreement between the LEAD procedure and the VDI. These study results imply that the VDI performs successfully as a diagnostic instrument specifically created for Vietnamese refugees and immigrants in their native language.

39,"Drawing on the life course perspective and the assumptive world theory, this paper examines whether pre-migration trauma exposure is associated with psychological distress through post-migration perceived discrimination for Asian American immigrants. The study is based on cross-sectional data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (N = 1639). Structural equation model is used to estimate the relationship between pre-migration trauma, post-migration perceived discrimination, and psychological distress. Additional models are estimated to explore possible variations across ethnic groups as well as across different types of pre-migration trauma experience. Pre-migration trauma exposure is associated with higher levels of psychological distress, both directly and indirectly through higher level of perceived discrimination, even after controlling for demographic/acculturative factors and post-migration trauma exposure. This pattern holds for the following sub-types of pre-migration trauma: political trauma, crime victimization, physical violence, accidental trauma, and relational trauma. Multi-group analyses show that this pattern holds for all Asian immigrant subgroups except the Vietnamese. Studies of immigrant mental health primarily focus on post-migration stressors. Few studies have considered the link between pre- and post-migration contexts in assessing mental health outcomes. The study illustrates the usefulness of bridging the pre- and post-migration context in identifying the mental health risks along the immigrant life course.",26319042,2016,Pre-migration Trauma Exposure and Psychological Distress for Asian American Immigrants: Linking the Pre- and Post-migration Contexts.

Findings indicate that for mothers (n = 144) and daughters (n = 149), self-reported anxiety levels decreased from baseline to follow up (p = 0.001). For mothers at follow up (n = 147), results indicate that affiliation to Latino culture is negatively associated with anxiety (p = 0.018). Conversely, employment and partner relationship stress are positively associated with anxiety (p = 0.05 and p = 0.016 respectively). In addition, self-reported anxiety is positively associated with alcohol intake (p = 0.002) and employment (p = 0.007). For daughters(n = 149), partner relationship stressors, anxiety and alcohol intake decreased significantly from baseline to follow up at a p = 0.01, p = 0.01, p = 0.05 respectively. In addition, for daughters at baseline (n = 160), affiliation to U.S. culture is positively associated with self-reported anxiety (p = 0.01). Employment is negatively associated with alcohol consumption (p = 0.027). At follow up (n = 152), daughters' partner relationship stress is positively associated with self- reported anxiety (p = 0.049).

Applying health theories, such as the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Integrated Health Coaching (IHC), may help optimize tooth brushing technique in those with suboptimal skills. Some motor activities, including tooth brushing, may over time become rote and unconscious actions, such that an existing habit can inhibit new learning, i.e., exert proactive interference on learning the new skill. Proactive interference may impede the acquisition of new tooth brushing skills; thus, in this report, we: (1) Review how the habit of tooth brushing is formed; (2) Postulate how proactive interference could impede the establishment of proper tooth brushing retraining; (3) Discuss the merits of this hypothesis; and (4) Provide guidance for future work in this topic within the context of an approach to behavior change that integrates IMB, MI and IHC methodology.",26457238,2015,Drilling Deeper into tooth brushing skills: Is proactive interference an under-recognized factor in oral hygiene behavior change?
42,"This paper examines before and after perceived stress scores (PSS) of Hispanic women participating in a brief community health promotion program. Scores declined dramatically and significantly after the intervention, approximating those of Hispanics nationally. Post PSS were significantly correlated with language preference (Spanish), educational level, employment, having gone to jail or been in detention, and income. In the regression model, language preference and income were significant. We suggest emotional fear at the onset of participation in the program may exert an influence on pre-PSS scores, and that increased familiarity/rapport with program staff and having social psychological needs met may ameliorate this fear. Preference for Spanish, the language spoken at home for the majority of participants, may indicate a resistance to acculturating to mainstream culture, and, consequently, create a buffer against perceived stress.",26472548,2016,Psychological Stress of Hispanics Living on the Border.

Twenty Latina workers in North Carolina with at least one child under age 12 completed in-depth interviews focused on their work organization, domestic responsibilities, work-family conflict, health, and family health. Using a systematic qualitative analysis, these women described a demanding work organization that is contingent and exploitative, with little control or support. They also described demanding domestic roles, with gendered and unequal division of household work. The resulting work-family conflict affects their mental and physical health, and has negative effects on the care and health of their families.

45,"It is thought that rewarding experiences with drugs create strong contextual associations and encourage repeated intake. In turn, repeated exposures to drugs of abuse make lasting alterations in the brain function of vulnerable individuals, and these persistent alterations likely serve to maintain the maladaptive drug seeking and taking behaviors characteristic of addiction/dependence(2). In rodents, reward experience and contextual associations are frequently measured using the conditioned place preference assay, or CPP, wherein preference for a previously drug-paired context is measured. Behavioral sensitization, on the other hand, is an increase in a drug-induced behavior that develops progressively over repeated exposures. Since sensitized behaviors can often be measured after several months of drug abstinence, depending on the dose and length of initial exposure, they are considered observable correlates of lasting drug-induced plasticity. Researchers have found these assays useful in determining the neurobiological substrates mediating aspects of addiction as well as assessing the potential of different interventions in disrupting these behaviors.

46,"Accumulating evidence suggests that an abnormal accumulation of iron in the substantia nigra (SN) is one of the defining characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD). Accordingly, the potential neuroprotection of Fe chelators is widely acknowledged for the treatment of PD. Although desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator widely used in clinical settings, has been reported to improve motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal survival in animal models of PD, DFO has poor penetration to cross the blood-brain barrier and elicits side effects. We evaluated whether an intranasal administration of DFO improves the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal axis and investigated the molecular mechanisms of intranasal DFO treatment in preventing MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. Treatment with DFO efficiently alleviated behavioral deficits, increased the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, and decreased the action of astrocytes in the SN and striatum in an MPTP-induced PD mouse model. Interestingly, we found that DFO up-regulated the expression of HIF-1α protein, TH, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) and down-regulated the expression of α-synuclein, divalent metal transporter with iron-responsive element (DMT1+IRE), and transferrin receptor (TFR). This was accompanied by a decrease in iron-positive cells in the SN and striatum of the DFO-treated group. We further revealed that DFO treatment significantly inhibited the MPTP-induced phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and differentially enhanced the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/P38 kinase. Additionally, the effects of DFO on increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio were further validated in vitro and in vivo. In SH-SY5Y cells, the DFO-mediated up-regulation of HIF-1α occurred via the activation of the ERK and P38MAPK signaling pathway. Collectively, the present data suggest that intranasal DFO treatment is effective in reversing MPTP-induced brain abnormalities and that HIF-1-pathway activation is a potential therapy target for the attenuation of neurodegeneration.",26996132,2016,Deferoxamine-mediated up-regulation of HIF-1α prevents dopaminergic neuronal death via the activation of MAPK family proteins in MPTP-treated mice.
47,"Age-associated health decline presents a significant challenge to healthcare, although there are few animal models that can be used to test potential treatments. Here, we show that there is a significant reduction in both spinal cord motor neurons and motor function over time in the aging rat. One explanation for this motor neuron loss could be reduced support from surrounding aging astrocytes. Indeed, we have previously shown using in vitro models that aging rat astrocytes are less supportive to rat motor neuron function and survival over time. Here, we test whether rejuvenating the astrocyte niche can improve the survival of motor neurons in an aging spinal cord. We transplanted fetal-derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the aging rat spinal cord and found that the cells survive and differentiate into astrocytes with a much higher efficiency than when transplanted into younger animals, suggesting that the aging environment stimulates astrocyte maturation. Importantly, the engrafted astrocytes were able to protect against motor neuron loss associated with aging, although this did not result in an increase in motor function based on behavioral assays. We also transplanted hNPCs genetically modified to secrete glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) into the aging rat spinal cord, as this combination of cell and protein delivery can protect motor neurons in animal models of ALS. During aging, GDNF-expressing hNPCs protected motor neurons, though to the same extent as hNPCs alone, and again had no effect on motor function. We conclude that hNPCs can survive well in the aging spinal cord, protect motor neurons and mature faster into astrocytes when compared to transplantation into the young spinal cord. While there was no functional improvement, there were no functional deficits either, further supporting a good safety profile of hNPC transplantation even into the older patient population.",27032721,2016,Human neural progenitors differentiate into astrocytes and protect motor neurons in aging rats.
48,"The opioidergic neuropeptides dynorphin (DYN) and enkephalin (ENK) and the D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors (D1R, D2R) are involved in the striatal control of motor and behavioral function. In Parkinson's disease, motor disturbances such as ""on-off"" motor fluctuations and involuntary movements (dyskinesia) are severe complications that often arise after chronic l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) treatment. Changes in the striatal expression of preproENK (PPENK), proDYN (PDYN), D1R, and D2R mRNA have been observed in parkinsonian animals treated with l-DOPA. Enhanced opioidergic transmission has been found in association with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, but the connection of PPENK, PDYN, D1R, and D2R mRNA expression with locomotor activity remains unclear. In this study, we measured PPENK, PDYN, D1R and D2R mRNA levels by in situ hybridization in the striatum of 6-OHDA hemi-parkinsonian rats treated with l-DOPA (PD+l-DOPA group), along with two control groups (PD+saline and naive+l-DOPA). We found different levels of expression of PPENK, PDYN, D1R and D2R mRNA across the experimental groups and correlated the changes in mRNA expression with dyskinesia and locomotor variables assessed by open field test during several phases of l-DOPA treatment. Both PDYN and PPENK mRNA levels were correlated with the severity of dyskinesia, while PPENK mRNA levels were also correlated with the frequency of contralateral rotational movements and with locomotor variables. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between D1R mRNA expression and D2R mRNA expression in the PD+l-DOPA group. These findings suggest that, in parkinsonian animals treated with l-DOPA, high levels of PPENK are a prerequisite for a locomotor sensitization to l-DOPA treatment, while PDYN overexpression is responsible only for the development of dyskinesia.",27072528,2016,Enkephalin and dynorphin neuropeptides are differently correlated with locomotor hypersensitivity and levodopa-induced dyskinesia in parkinsonian rats.
49,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans can result in permanent tissue damage and has been linked to cognitive impairment that lasts years beyond the initial insult. Clinically effective treatment strategies have yet to be developed. Transplantation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) has the potential to restore cognition lost due to injury, however, the vast majority of rodent TBI/hNSC studies to date have evaluated cognition only at early time points, typically <1month post-injury and cell transplantation. Additionally, human cell engraftment and long-term survival in rodent models of TBI has been difficult to achieve due to host immunorejection of the transplanted human cells, which confounds conclusions pertaining to transplant-mediated behavioral improvement. To overcome these shortfalls, we have developed a novel TBI xenotransplantation model that utilizes immunodeficient athymic nude (ATN) rats as the host recipient for the post-TBI transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived NSCs and have evaluated cognition in these animals at long-term (≥2months) time points post-injury. We report that immunodeficient ATN rats demonstrate hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits (Novel Place, Morris Water Maze), but not non-spatial (Novel Object) or emotional/anxiety-related (Elevated Plus Maze, Conditioned Taste Aversion) deficits, at 2-3months post-TBI, confirming that ATN rats recapitulate some of the cognitive deficits found in immunosufficient animal strains. Approximately 9-25% of transplanted hNSCs survived for at least 5months post-transplantation and differentiated into mature neurons (NeuN, 18-38%), astrocytes (GFAP, 13-16%), and oligodendrocytes (Olig2, 11-13%). Furthermore, while this model of TBI (cortical impact) targets primarily cortex and the underlying hippocampus and generates a large lesion cavity, hNSC transplantation facilitated cognitive recovery without affecting either lesion volume or total spared cortical or hippocampal tissue volume. Instead, we have found an overall increase in host hippocampal neuron survival in hNSC transplanted animals and demonstrate that a correlation exists between hippocampal neuron survival and cognitive performance. Together, these findings support the use of immunodeficient rodents in models of TBI that involve the transplantation of human cells, and suggest that hNSC transplantation may be a viable, long-term therapy to restore cognition after brain injury.",27079998,2016,Transplantation of human neural stem cells restores cognition in an immunodeficient rodent model of traumatic brain injury.
50,"Although aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are commonly used therapies for breast cancer, their use is limited because they produce arthralgia in a large number of patients. To determine whether AIs produce hypersensitivity in animal models of pain, we examined the effects of the AI, letrozole, on mechanical, thermal, and chemical sensitivity in rats. In ovariectomized (OVX) rats, administering a single dose of 1 or 5mg/kg letrozole significantly reduced mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds, without altering thermal sensitivity. Repeated injection of 5mg/kg letrozole in male rats produced mechanical, but not thermal, hypersensitivity that extinguished when drug dosing was stopped. A single dose of 5mg/kg letrozole or daily dosing of letrozole or exemestane in male rats also augmented flinching behavior induced by intraplantar injection of 1000nmol of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). To determine whether sensitization of sensory neurons contributed to AI-induced hypersensitivity, we evaluated the excitability of neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglia of male rats chronically treated with letrozole. Both small and medium-diameter sensory neurons isolated from letrozole-treated rats were more excitable, as reflected by increased action potential firing in response to a ramp of depolarizing current, a lower resting membrane potential, and a lower rheobase. However, systemic letrozole treatment did not augment the stimulus-evoked release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from spinal cord slices, suggesting that the enhanced nociceptive responses were not secondary to an increase in peptide release from sensory endings in the spinal cord. These results provide the first evidence that AIs modulate the excitability of sensory neurons, which may be a primary mechanism for the effect of these drugs to augment pain behaviors in rats.",27072527,2016,Aromatase inhibitors augment nociceptive behaviors in rats and enhance the excitability of sensory neurons.

52,"Exposure to stressful life events plays a central role in the development of mood disorders in vulnerable individuals. However, the mechanisms that link mood disorders to stress are poorly understood. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has long been implicated in positive regulation of depression and anxiety, while its precursor (proBDNF) recently showed an opposing effect on such mental illnesses. P75(NTR) and sortilin are co-receptors of proBDNF, however, the role of these receptors in mood regulation is not established. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of sortilin in regulating mood-related behaviors and its role in the proBDNF-mediated mood abnormality in mice. We found that sortilin was up-regulated in neocortex (by 78.3%) and hippocampus (by 111%) of chronically stressed mice as assessed by western blot analysis. These changes were associated with decreased mobility in the open field test and increased depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test. We also found that sortilin deficiency in mice resulted in hyperlocomotion in the open field test and increased anxiety-like behavior in both the open field and elevated plus maze tests. No depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test and no deficit in spatial cognition in the Morris water maze test were found in the Sort1-deficient mice. Moreover, the intracellular and extracellular levels of mature BDNF and proBDNF were not changed when sortilin was absent in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we found that both WT and Sort1-deficient mice injected with proBDNF in lateral ventricle displayed increased depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test but not anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. The present study suggests that sortilin functions as a negative regulator of mood performance and can be a therapeutic target for the treatment of mental illness.",27118371,2016,Mice with Sort1 deficiency display normal cognition but elevated anxiety-like behavior.
53,"Dysregulation of the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway has been associated with the progression of Huntington's disease (HD). In particular, elevated levels of the kynurenine metabolites 3-hydroxy kynurenine (3-OH-Kyn) and quinolinic acid (Quin), have been reported in the brains of HD patients as well as in rodent models of HD. The production of these metabolites is controlled by the activity of kynurenine mono-oxygenase (KMO), an enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of 3-OH-Kyn from Kyn. In order to determine the role of KMO in the phenotype of mouse models of HD, we have developed a potent and selective KMO inhibitor termed CHDI-340246. We show that this compound, when administered orally to transgenic mouse models of HD, potently and dose-dependently modulates the Kyn pathway in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system. The administration of CHDI-340246 leads to an inhibition of the formation of 3-OH-Kyn and Quin, and to an elevation of Kyn and Kynurenic acid (KynA) levels in brain tissues. We show that administration of CHDI-340246 or of Kyn and of KynA can restore several electrophysiological alterations in mouse models of HD, both acutely and after chronic administration. However, using a comprehensive panel of behavioral tests, we demonstrate that the chronic dosing of a selective KMO inhibitor does not significantly modify behavioral phenotypes or natural progression in mouse models of HD.",27163548,2016,The novel KMO inhibitor CHDI-340246 leads to a restoration of electrophysiological alterations in mouse models of Huntington's disease.
54,"Neonatal or early-life seizures (ELS) are often associated with life-long neurophysiological, cognitive and behavioral deficits, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these deficits remain poorly understood. Newborn, post-migratory cortical neurons sprout ciliary buds (procilia) that mature into primary cilia. Disruption of the growth or signaling capabilities of these cilia has been linked to atypical neurite outgrowth from neurons and abnormalities in neuronal circuitry. Here, we tested the hypothesis that generalized seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or kainic acid (KA) during early postnatal development impair neuronal and/or glial ciliogenesis. Mice received PTZ (50 or 100mg/kg), KA (2mg/kg), or saline either once at birth (P0), or once daily from P0 to P4. Using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, the cilia of neurons and glia were examined at P7, P14, and P42. A total of 83 regions were analyzed, representing 13 unique neocortical and hippocampal regions. Neuronal cilia were identified by co-expression of NeuN and type 3 adenylyl cyclase (ACIII) or somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3), while glial cilia were identified by co-expression of GFAP, Arl13b, and gamma-tubulin. We found that PTZ exposure at either P0 or from P0 to P4 induced convulsive behavior, followed by acute and lasting effects on neuronal cilia lengths that varied depending on the cortical region, PTZ dose, injection frequency, and time post-PTZ. Both increases and decreases in neuronal cilia length were observed. No changes in the length of glial cilia were observed under any of the test conditions. Lastly, we found that a single KA seizure at P0 led to similar abnormalities in neuronal cilia lengths. Our results suggest that seizure(s) occurring during early stages of cortical development induce persistent and widespread changes in neuronal cilia length. Given the impact neuronal cilia have on neuronal differentiation, ELS-induced changes in ciliogenesis may contribute to long-term pathology and abnormal cortical function.",27181411,2016,Neonatal seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol or kainic acid disrupt primary cilia growth on developing mouse cortical neurons.
55,"Despite progress in elucidating mechanisms of depression, the efficacy of different treatments remains inadequate. Recent small-scale clinical studies suggested anti-depressant treatment using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum or subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC), yet controlled, multi-center trials were unsuccessful. We recently suggested the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as an important intersection for treating depression. We also found that stimulation of the VTA of a genetic rat model of depression (Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats) with a programmed pattern designed to mimic the burst firing of normal rats decreases depressive-like behavior. Herein, we examined the possibility of reaching the VTA - located deep in the brain stem - through its direct connection to the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which parallels the human SCC. Thus, we compared treatment of FSLs with modified versions of DBS - either chronic-intermittent low-frequency electrical stimulation of the vmPFC, or patterned acute electrical stimulation (pAES), which integrates transcranial magnetic stimulation properties, namely, bursts of pulse trains and low frequency stimulation, applied to the VTA. We found that stimulation of the vmPFC (20Hz, 15min/day, 10days) improved depressive-like behavior and VTA local field potential (LFP) activity of FSLs, yet it had only a partial long-term effect on behavior. In particular, vmPFC stimulation decreased theta band activity, which correlated with the improvement in depressive-like behavior of all treated FSLs at day 1, and in ~50% of treated FSLs at day 28 post treatment. pAES of the VTA (10Hz, 20min) caused significant, long-term improvement of depressive-like behavior of FSLs, concurrently with normalizing intra-VTA LFP activity, and increasing VTA LFP synchronicity and hippocampal BDNF mRNA levels. Thus, although low-frequency electrical stimulation of the PFC alters VTA activity, leading to attenuation of depressive-like manifestations, a specific stimulation pattern affecting VTA cell programming is important for long-term efficacy.",27181412,2016,Electrical stimulation of the vmPFC serves as a remote control to affect VTA activity and improve depressive-like behavior.
56,"Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) and its long term consequences are a major health concern among veterans. Despite recent work enhancing our knowledge about bTBI, very little is known about the contribution of the blast wave alone to the observed sequelae. Herein, we isolated its contribution in a mouse model by constraining the animals' heads during exposure to a shockwave (primary blast). Our results show that exposure to primary blast alone results in changes in hippocampus-dependent behaviors that correspond with electrophysiological changes in area CA1 and are accompanied by reactive gliosis. Specifically, five days after exposure, behavior in an open field and performance in a spatial object recognition (SOR) task were significantly different from sham. Network electrophysiology, also performed five days after injury, demonstrated a significant decrease in excitability and increase in inhibitory tone. Immunohistochemistry for GFAP and Iba1 performed ten days after injury showed a significant increase in staining. Interestingly, a threefold increase in the impulse of the primary blast wave did not exacerbate these measures. However, we observed a significant reduction in the contribution of the NMDA receptors to the field EPSP at the highest blast exposure level. Our results emphasize the need to account for the effects of primary blast loading when studying the sequelae of bTBI.",27246999,2016,Primary blast injury causes cognitive impairments and hippocampal circuit alterations.
57,"Tissue damage is one of the major etiological factors in the emergence of chronic/persistent pain, although mechanisms remain enigmatic. Using incision of the back skin of adult rats as a model for tissue damage, we observed sensitization in a nociceptive reflex enduring to 28days post-incision (DPI). To determine if the enduring behavioral changes corresponded with a long-term impact of tissue damage on sensory neurons, we examined the temporal expression profile of injury-regulated genes and the electrophysiological properties of traced dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. The mRNA for the injury/stress-hub gene Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) was upregulated and peaked within 4 DPI, after which levels declined but remained significantly elevated out to 28 DPI, a time when the initial incision appears healed and tissue-inflammation largely resolved. Accordingly, stereological image analysis indicated that some neurons expressed ATF3 only transiently (mostly medium-large neurons), while in others it was sustained (mostly small neurons), suggesting cell-type-specific responses. In retrogradely-traced ATF3-expressing neurons, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) protein levels and isolectin-B4 (IB4)-binding were suppressed whereas Growth Associated Protein-43 (GAP-43) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) protein levels were enhanced. Electrophysiological recordings from DiI-traced sensory neurons 28 DPI showed a significant sensitization limited to ATF3-expressing neurons. Thus, ATF3 expression is revealed as a strong predictor of single cells displaying enduring pain-related electrophysiological properties. The cellular injury/stress response induced in sensory neurons by tissue damage and indicated by ATF3 expression is positioned to contribute to pain which can occur after tissue damage.",27264359,2016,Cutaneous tissue damage induces long-lasting nociceptive sensitization and regulation of cellular stress- and nerve injury-associated genes in sensory neurons.
58,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a significant number of patients not adequately responding to treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical technique currently investigated for medically-refractory psychiatric disorders. Here, we use the poly I:C rat model of schizophrenia to study the effects of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (Nacc) DBS on two behavioral schizophrenia-like deficits, i.e. sensorimotor gating, as reflected by disrupted prepulse inhibition (PPI), and attentional selectivity, as reflected by disrupted latent inhibition (LI). In addition, the neurocircuitry influenced by DBS was studied using FDG PET. We found that mPFC- and Nacc-DBS alleviated PPI and LI abnormalities in poly I:C offspring, whereas Nacc- but not mPFC-DBS disrupted PPI and LI in saline offspring. In saline offspring, mPFC-DBS increased metabolism in the parietal cortex, striatum, ventral hippocampus and Nacc, while reducing it in the brainstem, cerebellum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Nacc-DBS, on the other hand, increased activity in the ventral hippocampus and olfactory bulb and reduced it in the septal area, brainstem, periaqueductal gray and hypothalamus. In poly I:C offspring changes in metabolism following mPFC-DBS were similar to those recorded in saline offspring, except for a reduced activity in the brainstem and hypothalamus. In contrast, Nacc-DBS did not induce any statistical changes in brain metabolism in poly I:C offspring. Our study shows that mPFC- or Nacc-DBS delivered to the adult progeny of poly I:C treated dams improves deficits in PPI and LI. Despite common behavioral responses, stimulation in the two targets induced different metabolic effects.",27302677,2016,Deep brain stimulation improves behavior and modulates neural circuits in a rodent model of schizophrenia.
59,"INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders consisting of delayed or impaired language development and difficulties in social interactions. The very high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD originates from the interaction between environmental risk factors and susceptible genetic loci, leading to epigenetic DNA methylation. Advances in system biology are becoming strategic for implementing knowledge on the ASD aetiology and for the early diagnosis of the disease after birth.


AREAS COVERED
We overhauled the value of either targeted or untargeted metabolomics studies in autism for identifying the most relevant metabolic pathways and key metabolites implicated in the disease, with special emphasis to mammalian-microbial metabolites. The most discriminant metabolites in ASD belong to amino acid metabolism, antioxidant status, nicotinic acid metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism. Expert commentary: Most published studies point out the role of metabolites derived from the gut microbiota: they can modulate the behavioral phenotype of the autistic children, greatly influencing host metabolic pathways and the immune system, shaping the individual susceptibility to the disease. Pitfalls and caveats in metabolomics results across studies have been additionally recognized and discussed leading to the conclusion that metabolomics studies in ASD are far to be definitive and univocal.",27310602,2016,Metabolomics of autism spectrum disorders: early insights regarding mammalian-microbial cometabolites.
60,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the influence of the sonic hedgehog (shh) pathway and its receptor smoothened (smo), on the survival and functionality of dopaminergic (DA) neurons.


BACKGROUND
During early development, shh induces the differentiation of DA neurons. However, it is unknown whether shh signaling is required in the maturation or maintenance of DA neurons during later development and adulthood due to the lethality of traditional shh knockout models.


METHODS
We utilized the cre-loxP system to achieve late developmental stage and cell type-specific deletion of the shh receptor, smo, in DA neurons by crossing DATcre (dopamine transporter) mice with Smo(loxP/loxP) mice. We assessed for differences between knockout (ko) and wildtype (wt) mice using combined histochemistry, gene expression analysis, and behavioral evaluation. Number and size of DA neurons in ventral midbrain and the DA neural terminal density in striatum were measured using unbiased stereological quantification. The survival of DA neurons under neurotoxin challenge was examined in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) Parkinson's disease animal model and the more subtle function under challenge of the dopaminergic system was examined by methamphetamine single- and repeated challenge in wt and ko mice.


RESULTS
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neuronal counts and neuronal size in substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) showed no difference between wt and DAT-Smo ko mice in young (5months) or aged (22months) mice. There was also no difference in the striatal DA projections between wt and ko mice in both age groups. In unilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesions modeling Parkinson's disease, using stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA intrastriatally led to loss of dopaminergic neurons in SN and diminished TH positive projections in striatum. However, there was no differences in survival of DA neurons between wt and ko mice. DAT-Smo ko mice demonstrated hyperactivity compared to wt mice at 5months, but showed no difference in activity at 22months. When injected with a one-time bolus of methamphetamine (METH), despite the higher basal locomotion activity, DAT-Smo ko mice showed a diminished response to a single METH challenge. In METH sensitization testing, ko mice showed decreased sensitization compared to wt mice without evidence of a delayed shift in dynamics of sensitization. Gene expression analysis showed decreased gene expression of smo, Gli 1 (known target gene of smo) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the SN. Gene expression was not altered in striatum for the genes examined in this study including dopamine receptor genes, neurotropic genes such as Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7).


CONCLUSION
Our study showed the smo receptor function is not required for the maturation and survival of DA neurons during late development, aging or under stress challenge. However, smo function has an influence on behavior in young adult mice and in responses of mice to a drug that modulates DA neurochemistry through regulation of gene expression in DA neurons. Since young adult DAT-smo ko mice show hyperactivity and altered response to a psychostimulant drug (METH), this may indicate the involvement of the shh pathway in the development of functional changes that manifest as alterations in DA pathway dynamics.",27317298,2016,Effect of the sonic hedgehog receptor smoothened on the survival and function of dopaminergic neurons.
61,"BACKGROUND
Antipsychotic-treated youth have increased risk for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Behavioral weight loss treatments show promise in reducing obesity and diabetes risk in antipsychotic treated adults, but have received no study in antipsychotic treated youth.


OBJECTIVE
We describe a rationale for behavioral weight loss interventions in high-weight antipsychotic treated youth, and report behavioral, anthropomorphic, and metabolic findings from a case series of obese antipsychotic-treated adolescents participating in a short-term, family-based behavioral weight loss intervention.


METHODS
We adapted the Traffic Light Plan, a 16-week family-based weight loss intervention that promotes healthy energy balance using the colors of the traffic light to categorize the nutritional value of foods and intensity of physical activity, adapting a social ecological framework to address health behavior change in multiple social contexts. The intervention was administered to three obese adolescents with long-term antipsychotic medication exposure. Efficacy of the intervention was evaluated with a battery of anthropomorphic and metabolic assessments including weight, body mass index percentile, whole body adiposity, liver fat content, and fasting plasma glucose and lipids. Participants and their parents also filled out a treatment satisfaction questionnaire upon study completion.


RESULTS
Two males and 1 female (all aged 14 years) participated. All 3 participants attended all 16 sessions, and experienced beneficial changes in adiposity, fasting lipids and liver fat content associated with weight stabilization or weight loss. Adolescents and their parents all reported a high level of satisfaction with the treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
Family-based behavioral weight loss treatment can be feasibly delivered and is acceptable to antipsychotic-treated youth and their families. Randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of behavioral weight loss interventions in antipsychotic treated youth and their families.",27347489,2016,Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment in Antipsychotic Treated Youth.
62,"Alterations in the neuro-immune balance play a major role in the pathophysiology of chronic neuropathic pain. MicroRNAs (miRNA) can regulate both immune and neuronal processes and may function as master switches in chronic pain development and maintenance. We set out to analyze the role of miR-132-3p, first in patients with peripheral neuropathies and second in an animal model of neuropathic pain. We initially determined miR-132-3p expression by measuring its levels in white blood cells (WBC) of 30 patients and 30 healthy controls and next in sural nerve biopsies of 81 patients with painful or painless inflammatory or non-inflammatory neuropathies based on clinical diagnosis. We found a 2.6 fold increase in miR-132-3p expression in WBC of neuropathy patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.001). MiR-132-3p expression was also slightly up-regulated in sural nerve biopsies from neuropathy patients suffering from neuropathic pain compared to those without pain (1.2 fold; p<0.001). These promising findings were investigated further in an animal model of neuropathic pain, the spared nerve injury model (SNI). For this purpose miR-132-3p expression levels were measured in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord of rats. Subsequently, miR-132-3p expression was pharmacologically modulated with miRNA antagonists or mimetics, and evoked pain and pain aversion were assessed. Spinal miR-132-3p levels were highest 10days after SNI, a time when persistent allodynia was established (p<0.05). Spinal administration of miR-132-3p antagonists via intrathecal (i.t.) catheters dose dependently reversed mechanical allodyina (p<0.001) and eliminated pain behavior in the place escape avoidance paradigm (p<0.001). Intrathecal administration of miR-132-3p mimetic dose-dependently induced pain behavior in naïve rats (p<0.001). Taken together these results indicate a pro-nociceptive effect of miR-132-3p in chronic neuropathic pain.",27349406,2016,Increased miR-132-3p expression is associated with chronic neuropathic pain.
63,"BACKGROUND
During inflammation, leukocytes are captured by the selectin family of adhesion receptors lining blood vessels to facilitate exit from the bloodstream. E-selectin is upregulated on stimulated endothelial cells and binds to several ligands on the surface of leukocytes. Selectin:ligand interactions are mediated in part by the interaction between the lectin domain and Sialyl-Lewis x (sLe(x)), a tetrasaccharide common to selectin ligands. There is a high degree of homology between selectins of various species: about 72 and 60 % in the lectin and EGF domains, respectively. In this study, molecular dynamics, docking, and steered molecular dynamics simulations were used to compare the binding and dissociation mechanisms of sLe(x) with mouse and human E-selectin. First, a mouse E-selectin homology model was generated using the human E-selectin crystal structure as a template.


RESULTS
Mouse E-selectin was found to have a greater interdomain angle, which has been previously shown to correlate with stronger binding among selectins. sLe(x) was docked onto human and mouse E-selectin, and the mouse complex was found to have a higher free energy of binding and a lower dissociation constant, suggesting stronger binding. The mouse complex had higher flexibility in a few key residues. Finally, steered molecular dynamics was used to dissociate the complexes at force loading rates of 2000-5000 pm/ps(2). The mouse complex took longer to dissociate at every force loading rate and the difference was statistically significant at 3000 pm/ps(2). When sLe(x)-coated microspheres were perfused through microtubes coated with human or mouse E-selectin, the particles rolled more slowly on mouse E-selectin.


CONCLUSIONS
Both molecular dynamics simulations and microsphere adhesion experiments show that mouse E-selectin protein binds more strongly to sialyl Lewis x ligand than human E-selectin. This difference was explained by a greater interdomain angle for mouse E-selectin, and greater flexibility in key residues. Future work could introduce similar amino acid substitutions into the human E-selectin sequence to further modulate adhesion behavior.",27368167,2016,Comparison of human and mouse E-selectin binding to Sialyl-Lewis(x).
64,"Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of medically-intractable epilepsy. While seizures in TLE originate in structures such as hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal cortex, they propagate through a crucial relay: the midline/intralaminar thalamus. Prior studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of midline thalamus attenuates limbic seizures. Here, we examined a recently developed technology, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), as a means of chemogenetic silencing to attenuate limbic seizures. Adult, male rats were electrically kindled from the amygdala, and injected with virus coding for inhibitory (hM4Di) DREADDs into the midline/intralaminar thalamus. When treated with the otherwise inert ligand Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10mg/kg, electrographic and behavioral seizure manifestations were suppressed in comparison to vehicle. At higher doses, we found complete blockade of seizure activity in a subset of subjects. CNO displayed a sharp time-response profile, with significant seizure attenuation seen 20-30min post injection, in comparison to 10 and 40min post injection. Seizures in animals injected with a control vector (i.e., no DREADD) were unaffected by CNO administration. These data underscore the crucial role of the midline/intralaminar thalamus in the propagation of seizures, specifically in the amygdala kindling model, and provide validation of chemogenetic silencing of limbic seizures.",27404844,2016,Chemogenetic silencing of the midline and intralaminar thalamus blocks amygdala-kindled seizures.
65,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia frequently responsible for cognitive decline in the elderly. The etiology and molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis remain inconclusive. Aging and vascular factors are important independent causes and contributors to sporadic AD. Clinical imaging studies showed that cerebral blood flow decreases before cognitive impairment in patients with AD. To investigate the effect of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on cognitive impairment and morphological features, we developed a new manner of CCH mouse model by narrowing bilateral common carotid arteries. Mice started to manifest spatial memory deficits 1month after the surgery and exhibited behavioral changes in a time-dependent manner. Mice also presented memory deficits accompanied with morphological changes at the neuronal and synaptic levels. CCH damaged the normal neuronal morphology and significantly reduced the expression level of PSD95. CCH activated astrocytes, increased the co-expression of GFAP and AQP4, and destroyed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, CCH facilitated intracellular and extracellular Aβ deposition by up-regulating γ-secretase and β-secretase levels. Our results showed good reproducibility of post-CCH pathological processes, which are characterized by neuronal apoptosis, axonal abnormalities, glial activation, BBB damage, amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction; these processes may be used to decipher the complex interplay and pathological process between CCH and AD. This study provides laboratory evidence for the prevention and treatment of cognitive malfunction and AD.",27421879,2016,Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induces memory deficits and facilitates Aβ generation in C57BL/6J mice.
66,"Cariprazine, a dopamine D3/D2 receptor partial agonist with preference for D3 receptors, has demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials in schizophrenia. This multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine for relapse prevention in adults with schizophrenia; total study duration was up to 97weeks. Schizophrenia symptoms were treated/stabilized with cariprazine 3-9mg/d during 20-week open-label treatment consisting of an 8-week, flexible-dose run-in phase and a 12-week fixed-dose stabilization phase. Stable patients who completed open-label treatment could be randomized to continued cariprazine (3, 6, or 9mg/d) or placebo for double-blind treatment (up to 72weeks). The primary efficacy parameter was time to relapse (worsening of symptom scores, psychiatric hospitalization, aggressive/violent behavior, or suicidal risk); clinical measures were implemented to ensure safety in case of impending relapse. A total of 264/765 patients completed open-label treatment; 200 eligible patients were randomized to double-blind placebo (n=99) or cariprazine (n=101). Time to relapse was significantly longer in cariprazine- versus placebo-treated patients (P=.0010, log-rank test). Relapse occurred in 24.8% of cariprazine- and 47.5% of placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio [95% CI]=0.45 [0.28, 0.73]). Akathisia (19.2%), insomnia (14.4%), and headache (12.0%) were reported in ≥10% of patients during open-label treatment; there were no cariprazine adverse events ≥10% during double-blind treatment. Long-term cariprazine treatment was significantly more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia. The long-term safety profile in this study was consistent with the safety profile observed in previous cariprazine clinical trials.

68,"BACKGROUND
The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of four weeks of an oral health optimized diet on periodontal clinical parameters in a randomized controlled trial.


METHODS
The experimental group (n = 10) had to change to a diet low in carbohydrates, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, and rich in vitamins C and D, antioxidants and fiber for four weeks. Participants of the control group (n = 5) did not change their dietary behavior. Plaque index, gingival bleeding, probing depths, and bleeding upon probing were assessed by a dentist with a pressure-sensitive periodontal probe. Measurements were performed after one and two weeks without a dietary change (baseline), followed by a two week transitional period, and finally performed weekly for four weeks.


RESULTS
Despite constant plaque values in both groups, all inflammatory parameters decreased in the experimental group to approximately half that of the baseline values (GI: 1.10 ± 0.51 to 0.54 ± 0.30; BOP: 53.57 to 24.17 %; PISA: 638 mm(2) to 284 mm(2)). This reduction was significantly different compared to that of the control group.


CONCLUSION
A diet low in carbohydrates, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, rich in vitamins C and D, and rich in fibers can significantly reduce gingival and periodontal inflammation.

69,"Mental disorders are a leading cause of disability, morbidity, and mortality among civilian and military populations. Most available treatments have limited efficacy, particularly in disorders where symptoms vary over relatively short time scales. Targeted modulation of neural circuits, particularly through open-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS), showed initial promise but has failed in blinded clinical trials. We propose a new approach, based on targeting neural circuits linked to functional domains that cut across diagnoses. Through that framework, which includes measurement of patients using six psychophysical tasks, we seek to develop a closed-loop DBS system that corrects dysfunctional activity in brain circuits underlying those domains. We present convergent preliminary evidence from functional neuroimaging, invasive human electrophysiology, and human brain stimulation experiments suggesting that this approach is feasible. Using the Emotional Conflict Resolution (ECR) task as an example, we show that emotion-related networks can be identified and modulated in individual patients. Invasive and non-invasive methodologies both identify a network between prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala. Further, stimulation in cingulate and amygdala changes patients' performance in ways that are linked to the task's emotional content. We present preliminary statistical models that predict this change and allow us to track it at a single-trial level. As these diagnostic and modeling strategies are refined and embodied in an implantable device, they offer the prospect of a new approach to psychiatric treatment and its accompanying neuroscience.",27485972,2017,Treating refractory mental illness with closed-loop brain stimulation: Progress towards a patient-specific transdiagnostic approach.

71,"A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how populations of neurons coordinate and cooperate in order to give rise to perception, cognition, and action. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are an attractive model with which to understand these mechanisms in humans, primarily due to the strong homology of their brains and the cognitively sophisticated behaviors they can be trained to perform. Using electrode recordings, the activity of one to a few hundred individual neurons may be measured electrically, which has enabled many scientific findings and the development of brain-machine interfaces. Despite these successes, electrophysiology samples sparsely from neural populations and provides little information about the genetic identity and spatial micro-organization of recorded neurons. These limitations have spurred the development of all-optical methods for neural circuit interrogation. Fluorescent calcium signals serve as a reporter of neuronal responses, and when combined with post-mortem optical clearing techniques such as CLARITY, provide dense recordings of neuronal populations, spatially organized and annotated with genetic and anatomical information. Here, we advocate that this methodology, which has been of tremendous utility in smaller animal models, can and should be developed for use with NHPs. We review here several of the key opportunities and challenges for calcium-based optical imaging in NHPs.

The key findings drawn from the analysis include the following: (1) in general, people who experienced racial discrimination have higher distrust and weaker social capital than those without perceived discrimination and both distrust and social capital are ultimately related to self-rated stress. (2) The direct relationship between perceived discrimination and self-rated stress is found for all race/ethnicity groups (except non-Hispanic other races) and it does not vary across groups. (3) The two pathways can be applied to non-Hispanic White and Black, but for Hispanic and non-Hispanic other races, we found little evidence for the social capital pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
For non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic, perceived discrimination is negatively related to self-rated stress. This finding highlights the importance of reducing interpersonal discriminatory behavior even for non-Hispanic White. The health care system distrust pathway can be used to address the racial health disparity in stress as it holds true for all four race/ethnicity groups. On the other hand, the social capital pathway seems to better help non-Hispanic White and Black to mediate the adverse effect of perceived discrimination on stress.",27852107,2018,A multi-group path analysis of the relationship between perceived racial discrimination and self-rated stress: how does it vary across racial/ethnic groups?

76,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the importance of distinguishing between primary and secondary racial identification in analyzing health disparities in a multiracial population.


METHODS
A cross-sectional analysis of 2012 Hawaii Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (H-BRFSS). As part of the survey, respondents were asked to identify all their races, and then which race they considered to be their primary race. We introduce two analytic approaches to investigate the association between multiracial status and general health: (1) including two separate dichotomous variables for each racial group (primary and secondary race; for example, 'primary Native Hawaiian' and, separately, 'secondary Native Hawaiian'), and (2) including one combined variable for anyone choosing a particular racial group, whether as primary or secondary race ('combined race'; e.g. Native Hawaiian). Linear regression then compares the multiracial health disparities identified by the two approaches, adjusted for age and gender.


RESULTS
The 2012 H-BRFSS had 7582 respondents. The four most common self-identified primary racial/ethnic groups were White, Japanese, Filipino, and Native Hawaiian. Native Hawaiians were the largest multiracial group with over 80% self-identifying as multiracial. Health disparities for Native Hawaiians, Portuguese and Puerto Ricans were attenuated by 10% after accounting for multiracial status. Populations that self-identified secondarily as Japanese, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and other PI had significantly poorer self-reported health.


CONCLUSION
The analysis illustrates the importance of accounting for multiracial populations in health disparities research and demonstrates the ability of two approaches to identify multiracial health disparities in data sets with limited sample sizes. The 'primary and secondary race' approach might work particularly well for a multicultural population like Hawaii.",27905209,2018,Distinguishing between primary and secondary racial identification in analyses of health disparities of a multiracial population in Hawaii.
77,"Many victims of blast-induced traumatic brain injury are occupants of military vehicles targeted by land mines. Recently improved vehicle designs protect these individuals against blast overpressure, leaving acceleration as the main force potentially responsible for brain injury. We recently developed a unique rat model of under-vehicle blast-induced hyperacceleration where exposure to acceleration as low as 50G force results in histopathological evidence of diffuse axonal injury and astrocyte activation, with no evidence of neuronal cell death. This study investigated the effects of much higher blast-induced accelerations (1200 to 2800G) on neuronal cell death, neuro-inflammation, behavioral deficits and mortality. Adult male rats were subjected to this range of accelerations, in the absence of exposure to blast overpressure, and evaluated over 28days for working memory (Y maze) and anxiety (elevated plus maze). In addition, brains obtained from rats at one and seven days post-injury were used for neuropathology and neurochemical assays. Sixty seven percent of rats died soon after being subjected to blasts resulting in 2800G acceleration. All rats exposed to 2400G acceleration survived and exhibited transient deficits in working memory and long-term anxiety like behaviors, while those exposed to 1200 acceleration G force only demonstrated increased anxiety. Behavioral deficits were associated with acute microglia/macrophage activation, increased hippocampal neuronal death, and reduced levels of tight junction- and synapse- associated proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure of rats to high underbody blast-induced G forces results in neurologic injury accompanied by neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation and evidence for neurosynaptic alterations.",27923561,2017,Neuropathology and neurobehavioral alterations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury to occupants of vehicles targeted by underbody blasts.
78,"It has been observed by in vivo imaging that damaged neuronal structures can be reversibly restored after ischemic insults with the application of timely therapeutic interventions. However, what degree of neuronal damage can be restored and the time frame for reversible recovery of neuronal structures remain unclear. Here, transcranial two-photon imaging, histological staining and electron microscopy were used to investigate the reversible recovery of neuronal structures from dendrites to soma after different durations of global cerebral ischemia in mice. Intravital imaging revealed that the damage to dendritic structures was reversible when ischemia time was <1h, but they became difficult to restore after >3h of ischemia. Data from fixed YFP brain slice and Golgi staining indicated that the damage of dendritic structures progressively extended to deeper dendritic shafts with the extension of ischemia time. Furthermore, longer duration of ischemia caused an increasing number of degenerating neurons. Importantly, significant chromatin margination and karyopyknosis of neuron were observed after 6h of ischemia. These data suggested that neuronal structures could be reversibly restored when ischemia time was <1h, but irreversible and progressive damage to neurons occurred with longer duration of ischemia. Consistently, behavioral performance of post-ischemic animals experienced an ischemia time-dependent recovery. Taken together, our data suggested that recovery of neuronal structures following ischemia was dependent on the duration of ischemia, and prevention of neuronal loss is a key target for therapeutic interventions in ischemic stroke.",27940018,2017,Reversible recovery of neuronal structures depends on the degree of neuronal damage after global cerebral ischemia in mice.
79,"The habenula is activated in response to stressful and aversive events, resulting in exploratory inhibition. Although possible mechanisms for habenula activation have been proposed, the effects of chronic stress on the habenular structure have never been studied. Herein, we assessed changes in volume, cell density and dendritic structure of habenular cells after chronic stress exposure using stereological and 3D morphological analysis. This study shows for the first time that there is a hemispherical asymmetry in the medial habenula (MHb) of the adult rat, with the right MHb containing more neurons than its left counterpart. Additionally, it shows that chronic stress induces a bilateral atrophy of both the MHb and the lateral habenula (LHb). This atrophy was accompanied by a reduction of the number of neurons in the right MHb and the number of glial cells in the bilateral LHb, but not by changes in the dendritic arbors of multipolar neurons. Importantly, these structural changes were correlated with elevated levels of serum corticosterone and increased anxious-like behavior in stressed animals. To further assess the role of the habenula in stress-related anxiety, bilateral lesions of the LHb were performed; interestingly, in lesioned animals the chronic stress protocol did not trigger increases in circulating corticosterone or anxious-like behavior. This study highlights the role of the habenula in the stress responses and how its sub-regions are structurally impacted by chronic stress with physiological and behavioral consequences.",27940019,2017,The habenula as a critical node in chronic stress-related anxiety.
80,"Neurotrophic factors are essential for neuronal survival, plasticity, and development and have been implicated in the action mechanism of antidepressants. In this study, we assessed the neurotrophic factor-inducing and neuroprotective properties of antidepressants. In the first part of the study, we found that fluoxetine, imipramine, and milnacipran (i.p., 20 mg/kg/day for 1 week or 3 weeks) upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum and substantia nigra both at 1 week and 3 weeks. In contrast, an increase in the glial-derived neurotrophic factor was more obvious at 3 weeks after the antidepressants treatment. Specifically, it was found that fluoxetine and imipramine are more potent in raising the levels of neurotrophic factors than milnacipran. Furthermore, antidepressants elevated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated-protein kinase (ERK1/2) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt. In the second part of the study, we compared the neuroprotective effects of fluoxetine, imipramine, and milnacipran in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease. Pretreament with fluoxetine, imipramine or milnacipran for 3 weeks reduced MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and microglial activation in the nigrostriatal pathway. Neurochemical analysis by HPLC exhibited that antidepressants attenuated the depletion of striatal dopamine. In consistent, beam test showed that behavioral impairment was ameliorated by antidepressants. Neuroprotective effects were more prominent in the fluoxetine or imipramine treatment group than in milnacipran treatment group. Finally, we found that neuroprotection of the antidepressants against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells was attenuated by ERK or Akt inhibitor. These results indicate that neuroprotection by antidepressants might be associated with the induction of neurotrophic factors, and antidepressant could be a potential therapeutic intervention for treatment of Parkinson's disease.",27975170,2018,Neuroprotective Effects of Antidepressants via Upregulation of Neurotrophic Factors in the MPTP Model of Parkinson's Disease.
81,"BACE1 encodes for the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 or β-secretase. Genetic deletion of Bace1 leads to behavioral alterations and affects midbrain dopaminergic signaling and memory processes. In order to further understand the role of BACE1 in brain function and behavior, we performed microarray transcriptome profiling and gene pathway analysis in the hippocampus of BACE1-deficient mice compared to wild type. We identified a total of 91 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), mostly enriched in pathways related to the immune and inflammation systems, particularly IL-9 and NF-κB activation pathways. Serum levels of IL-9 were elevated in BACE1-deficient mice. Our network analysis supports an intimate connection between immune response via NF-κB and BACE1 signaling through the NRG1/Akt1 pathway. Our findings warrant future mechanistic studies to determine if BACE1 signaling and the IL-9 pathway interact to alter behavior and brain function.

82,"Rodent models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) reproduce secondary injury sequela and cognitive impairments observed in patients afflicted by a TBI. Impaired neurotransmission has been reported in the weeks following experimental TBI, and may be a contributor to behavioral dysfunction. The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, the machinery facilitating vesicular docking and fusion, is a highly-conserved mechanism important for neurotransmission. Following TBI, there is a reduction in both the formation of the SNARE complex and the abundance of multiple SNARE proteins, including the chaperone protein cysteine string protein α (CSPα). Treatment with lithium in naïve rats reportedly increases the expression of CSPα. In the context of TBI, brain-injured rats treated with lithium exhibit improved outcome in published reports, but the mechanisms underlying the improvement are poorly understood. The current study evaluated the effect of lithium administration on the abundance of SNARE proteins and SNARE complex formation, hemispheric tissue loss, and neurobehavioral performance following controlled cortical impact (CCI). Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to CCI or sham injury, and treated daily with lithium chloride or vehicle for up to 14days. Administration of lithium after TBI modestly improved spatial memory at 14days post-injury. Semi-quantitative immunoblot analysis of hippocampal lysates revealed that treatment with lithium attenuated reductions in key SNARE proteins and SNARE complex formation at multiple time points post-injury. These findings highlight that treatment with lithium increased the abundance of synaptic proteins that facilitate neurotransmission and may contribute to improved cognitive function after TBI.",28011122,2017,Lithium increases hippocampal SNARE protein abundance after traumatic brain injury.

This study examined associations of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) with adolescents' immigration status and language spoken at home and with friends.


METHODS
Participants (N = 2475) were included from Wave 1 of the NEXT Generation Health Study, a nationally representative 10th-grade cohort study starting in 2009. PA included recommended moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and vigorous PA (VPA); SB included screen viewing and social-media use. Linear and logistic regressions were conducted controlling for complex survey variables.


RESULTS
Adolescents with non US-born compared with US-born parents were less likely to engage in VPA (odds ratio = 0.60, p ≤ .05, 95% CI = 0.38-0.96). Parent country of origin and language spoken were not significantly associated with recommended MVPA engagement.

84,"Zonisamide (ZNS), an anticonvulsant drug exhibiting symptomatic effects in Parkinson's disease (PD), was recently reported to exert neuroprotection in rodent models. One of the proposed neuroprotective mechanisms involves increased protein expression of xCT, the specific subunit of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc-, inducing glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Here, we investigated the outcome of ZNS treatment in a mouse model of PD based on intranigral proteasome inhibition, and whether the observed effects would be mediated by system xc-. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (LAC) was administered intranigrally to male C57BL/6J mice receiving repeated intraperitoneal injections of either ZNS 30mgkg-1 or vehicle. Drug administration was initiated three days prior to stereotaxic LAC injection and was maintained until six days post-surgery. One week after lesion, mice were behaviorally assessed and investigated in terms of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration and molecular changes at the level of the basal ganglia, including expression levels of xCT. ZNS reduced the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons following LAC injection and the degree of sensorimotor impairment. ZNS failed, however, to modulate xCT expression in basal ganglia of lesioned mice. In a separate set of experiments, the impact of ZNS treatment on system xc- was investigated in control conditions in vivo as well as in vitro. Similarly, ZNS did not influence xCT or glutathione levels in naive male C57BL/6J mice, nor did it alter system xc- activity or glutathione content in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ZNS treatment provides neuroprotection and behavioral improvement in a PD mouse model based on proteasome inhibition via system xc- independent mechanisms.",28024798,2017,Zonisamide attenuates lactacystin-induced parkinsonism in mice without affecting system xc<sup/>.
85,"Status epilepticus (SE) in rats, along with chronic epilepsy, leads to the development of behavioral impairments resembling depressive disorder and/or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), thus reflecting respective comorbidities in epilepsy patients. Suppressed neurotransmitter tone in the raphe nucleus (RN)-prefrontal cortex (PFC) serotonergic pathway and in the locus coeruleus (LC)-PFC noradrenergic pathway underlies depressive- and impulsive-like behavioral deficits respectively. We examined possible mechanisms leading to the monoamine dysfunction in brainstem efferents, namely modulatory effects of the neuropeptide galanin on serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) signaling. SE was induced in young adult male Wistar rats by LiCl and pilocarpine. Epileptic rats were categorized vis-à-vis behavioral deficits as not impaired, ""depressed"" and ""impulsive"". Depressive- and impulsive-like behaviors were examined in the forced swimming test (FST). The strength of serotonergic transmission in RN-PFC and of noradrenergic transmission in LC-PFC was analyzed using in vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Galanin receptor type 1 (GalR1)/type 2 (GalR2) antagonist M40, and a preferential GalR2 antagonist M871 were administered over 3days locally into either RN or LC by means of ALZET osmotic minipumps connected to locally implanted infusion cannulas. Intra-RN injection of M40 improved serotonergic tone and depressive-like behavior in epileptic ""depressed"" rats. Intra-LC injection of M40 improved noradrenergic tone and impulsive-like behavior in epileptic ""impulsive"" rats. The effects of M40 were only observed in impaired subjects. The treatment did not modify neurotransmission and behavior in naïve and epileptic not impaired rats; in ""depressed"" rats the effects were limited to serotonergic transmission and immobility, while in ""impulsive"" rats - to noradrenergic transmission and struggling behavior. Intra-RN administration of M871 exacerbated depressive-like behavior, but had no effects on any other of the examined parameters in any category of animals. These findings suggest that endogenous galanin, acting through GalR1 may be involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy-associated depression and ADHD via inhibiting RN-PFC serotonergic and LC-PFC noradrenergic transmissions respectively.",28013000,2017,Galanin contributes to monoaminergic dysfunction and to dependent neurobehavioral comorbidities of epilepsy.
86,"The role of microglia in the pathophysiology of injury to the developing brain has been extensively studied. In children under the age of 4 who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI), markers of microglial/macrophage activation were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid and were associated with worse neurologic outcome. Minocycline is an antibiotic that decreases microglial/macrophage activation following hypoxic-ischemia in neonatal rodents and TBI in adult rodents thereby reducing neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits. In study 1, 11-day-old rats received an impact to the intact skull and were treated for 3days with minocycline. Immediately following termination of minocycline administration, microglial reactivity was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus (p<0.001) and was accompanied by an increase in the number of fluoro-Jade B profiles (p<0.001) suggestive of a reduced clearance of degenerating cells; however, this effect was not sustained at 7days post-injury. Although microglial reactivity was reduced in the white matter tracts (p<0.001), minocycline treatment did not reduce axonal injury or degeneration. In the thalamus, minocycline treatment did not affect microglial reactivity, axonal injury and degeneration, and neurodegeneration. Injury-induced spatial learning and memory deficits were also not affected by minocycline. In study 2, to test whether extended dosing of minocycline may be necessary to reduce the ongoing pathologic alterations, a separate group of animals received minocycline for 9days. Immediately following termination of treatment, microglial reactivity and neurodegeneration in all regions examined were exacerbated in minocycline-treated brain-injured animals compared to brain-injured animals that received vehicle (p<0.001), an effect that was only sustained in the cortex and hippocampus up to 15days post-injury (p<0.001). Whereas injury-induced spatial learning deficits remained unaffected by minocycline treatment, memory deficits appeared to be significantly worse (p<0.05). Sex had minimal effects on either injury-induced alterations or the efficacy of minocycline treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate the differential effects of minocycline in the immature brain following impact trauma and suggest that minocycline may not be an effective therapeutic strategy for TBI in the immature brain.",28038986,2017,Differential effects of minocycline on microglial activation and neurodegeneration following closed head injury in the neonate rat.
87,"How and which aspects of neural activity give rise to subjective perceptual experience-i.e. conscious perception-is a fundamental question of neuroscience. To date, the vast majority of work concerning this question has come from vision, raising the issue of generalizability of prominent resulting theories. However, recent work has begun to shed light on the neural processes subserving conscious perception in other modalities, particularly audition. Here, we outline a roadmap for the future study of conscious auditory perception and its neural basis, paying particular attention to how conscious perception emerges (and of which elements or groups of elements) in complex auditory scenes. We begin by discussing the functional role of the auditory system, particularly as it pertains to conscious perception. Next, we ask: what are the phenomena that need to be explained by a theory of conscious auditory perception? After surveying the available literature for candidate neural correlates, we end by considering the implications that such results have for a general theory of conscious perception as well as prominent outstanding questions and what approaches/techniques can best be used to address them.This article is part of the themed issue 'Auditory and visual scene analysis'.",28044014,2017,A roadmap for the study of conscious audition and its neural basis.
88,"Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) attenuate inflammation and improve neurological outcome in response to traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we found that NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokines were activated in human brains after TBI. Rats treated with ω-3 FAs had significantly less TBI-induced caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion than those with vehicle. G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) was observed to be involved in this anti-inflammation. GW1100, a GPR40 inhibitor, eliminated the anti-inflammatory effect of ω-3 FAs after TBI. β-Arrestin-2 (ARRB2), a downstream scaffold protein of GPR40, was activated to inhibit inflammation via directly binding with NLRP3 in the ω-3 FAs treatment group. Interestingly, we also observed that ω-3 FAs prevented NLRP3 mitochondrial localization, which was reversed by GW1100. Furthermore, ω-3 FAs markedly ameliorated neuronal death and behavioral deficits after TBI, while GW1100 significantly suppressed this effect. Collectively, these data indicate that the GPR40-mediated pathway is involved in the inhibitory effects of ω-3 FAs on TBI-induced inflammation and ARRB2 is activated to interact with NLRP3.",28077335,2017,Omega-3 fatty acids regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevent behavior deficits after traumatic brain injury.
89,"Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a disabling motor complication occurring in Parkinson's disease patients (PD) after long-term l-DOPA treatment. Although its etiology remains unclear, there is accumulating evidence that LID relies on an excessive dopamine receptor transmission, particularly at the downstream signaling of D1 receptors. We previously reported that the pharmacological blockade of 5-alpha reductase (5AR), the rate limiting enzyme in neurosteroids synthesis, rescued a number of behavioral aberrations induced by D1 receptor-selective and non-selective agonists, without inducing extrapyramidal symptoms. Thus, the present study was designed to verify whether the 5AR inhibitor finasteride (FIN) may counteract the dyskinesias induced by dopaminergic agonists in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. First, we assessed the acute and chronic effect of different doses of FIN (30-60mg/kg) on LID, in male 6-OHDA-lesioned dyskinetic rats. Thereafter, to fully characterize the therapeutic potential of FIN on LID and its impact on l-DOPA efficacy, we assessed abnormal involuntary movements and forelimb use in hemiparkinsonian male rats chronically injected with FIN (30-60mg/kg/24days) either prior to- or concomitant with l-DOPA administration. In addition, to investigate whether the impact of FIN on LID may be ascribed to a modulation of the D1- or D2/D3-receptor function, dyskinesias were assessed in l-DOPA-primed 6-OHDA-lesioned rats that received FIN in combination with selective direct dopaminergic agonists. Finally, we set to investigate whether FIN may produce similar effect in female hemiparkinsonian rats, as seen in males. The results indicated that FIN administrations significantly dampened LID in all tested treatment regimens, without interfering with the ability of l-DOPA to ameliorate forelimb use in the stepping test. The antidyskinetic effect appears to be due to modulation of both D1- and D2/D3-receptor function, as FIN also reduced abnormal involuntary movements induced by the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF-82958 and the D2/D3 receptor agonist ropinirole. Significant dampening of LID was also observed in female rats, although only at the higher tested dose. Clinical investigations are warranted to assess whether similar protection from dyskinesia is seen in PD patients.",28131725,2017,The 5-alpha reductase inhibitor finasteride reduces dyskinesia in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.
90,"Intrastriatal injection of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) protein has been shown to provide neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) - lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. Here, we used an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector to deliver the human MANF (hMANF) gene into the rat striatum 10days after a 6-OHDA lesion to examine long-term effects of hMANF on nigral dopaminergic neurons and mechanisms underlying MANF neuroprotection. Intrastriatal injection of AAV9-hMANF vectors led to a robust and widespread expression of the hMANF gene in the injected striatum up to 24weeks. Increased levels of hMANF protein were also detected in the ipsilateral substantia nigra. The hMANF gene transfer promoted the survival of nigral dopaminergic neurons, regeneration of striatal dopaminergic fibers and an upregulation of striatal dopamine levels, resulting in a long-term improvement of rotational behavior up to 16weeks after viral injections. By using SH-SY5Y cells, we found that intra- and extracellular application of MANF protected cells against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity via inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results suggest that AAV9-mediated hMANF gene delivery into the striatum exerts long-term neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in parkinsonian rats, and provide insights into mechanisms responsible for MANF neuroprotection.",28131727,2017,Long-term protective effects of AAV9-mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor gene transfer in parkinsonian rats.
91,"Gene selection is a demanding task for microarray data analysis. The diverse complexity of different cancers makes this issue still challenging. In this study, a novel evolutionary method based on genetic algorithms and artificial intelligence is proposed to identify predictive genes for cancer classification. A filter method was first applied to reduce the dimensionality of feature space followed by employing an integer-coded genetic algorithm with dynamic-length genotype, intelligent parameter settings, and modified operators. The algorithmic behaviors including convergence trends, mutation and crossover rate changes, and running time were studied, conceptually discussed, and shown to be coherent with literature findings. Two well-known filter methods, Laplacian and Fisher score, were examined considering similarities, the quality of selected genes, and their influences on the evolutionary approach. Several statistical tests concerning choice of classifier, choice of dataset, and choice of filter method were performed, and they revealed some significant differences between the performance of different classifiers and filter methods over datasets. The proposed method was benchmarked upon five popular high-dimensional cancer datasets; for each, top explored genes were reported.

92,"Nitric oxide (NO)-dependent pathways and cerebrovascular dysfunction have been shown to contribute to the cognitive decline and neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but whether they represent initial factors or later changes of the disease is still a matter of debate. In this work, we aimed at investigating whether and to what extent neuronal-derived NO signaling and related neurovascular coupling are impaired along aging in the hippocampus of the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease (3xTg-AD). We performed a longitudinal study combining behavior studies, in vivo simultaneous measurements of NO concentration gradients and cerebral blood flow (CBF), along with detection of NO synthase (NOS) and markers of nitroxidative stress. Our results revealed an impairment in the neurovascular coupling along aging in the 3xTg-AD mice which preceded obvious cognitive decline. This impairment was characterized by diminished CBF changes in response to normal or even increased NO signals and associated with markers of nitroxidative stress. The results suggest that impairment in neurovascular coupling is primarily due to cerebrovascular dysfunction, rather than due to dysfunctional NO signaling from neurons to blood vessels. Overall, this work supports cerebrovascular dysfunction as a fundamental underlying process in AD pathology.",28161255,2017,Neurovascular uncoupling in the triple transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease: Impaired cerebral blood flow response to neuronal-derived nitric oxide signaling.
93,"PURPOSE
Knowledge on the meaning of quality of life in individuals with spinal cord injury in developing countries is limited. This study aims to explore the meaning and components of quality of life for individuals with spinal cord injury in a rural area in Indonesia.


METHOD
Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 12 individuals with paraplegia (8 males, 4 females) aged 24-67 years. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes that constitute meaning and components of quality of life.


RESULTS
Quality of life was not an easily understood concept, while ""life satisfaction"" and ""happiness"" were. Life satisfaction was associated with a person's feeling when achieving goals or dreams and related to fulfillment of needs. Thirteen components of life satisfaction were identified and categorized into five domains as follows: (1) participation: earning income and work, being useful to others, community participation, and having skills and knowledge, (2) social support: social support, social relationship, (3) relationship with God: injury is God's will, praying, (4) independence: being independent, mobility and accessibility, and health, and (5) psychological resources: accepting the condition, maintaining goals and motivation.


CONCLUSIONS
Social, cultural and religious influences were prominent in the perception of life satisfaction. The measurement of quality of life for individuals with spinal cord injury in Indonesia needs to consider locally perceived meaning and components of quality of life. Implications for Rehabilitation Financial, social and health needs of individuals with spinal cord injury in Indonesia must be immediately addressed. To increase financial independence, rehabilitation professionals should equip individuals with spinal cord injury with adequate self-employment skills.

94,"CHIMERA (Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration) is a recently described animal model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that primarily produces diffuse axonal injury (DAI) characterized by white matter inflammation and axonal damage. CHIMERA was specifically designed to reliably generate a variety of TBI severities using precise and quantifiable biomechanical inputs in a nonsurgical user-friendly platform. The objective of this study was to define the lower limit of single impact mild TBI (mTBI) using CHIMERA by characterizing the dose-response relationship between biomechanical input and neurological, behavioral, neuropathological and biochemical outcomes. Wild-type male mice were subjected to a single CHIMERA TBI using six impact energies ranging from 0.1 to 0.7J, and post-TBI outcomes were assessed over an acute period of 14days. Here we report that single TBI using CHIMERA induces injury dose- and time-dependent changes in behavioral and neurological deficits, axonal damage, white matter tract microgliosis and astrogliosis. Impact energies of 0.4J or below produced no significant phenotype (subthreshold), 0.5J led to significant changes for one or more phenotypes (threshold), and 0.6 and 0.7J resulted in significant changes in all outcomes assessed (mTBI). We further show that linear head kinematics are the most robust predictors of duration of unconsciousness, severity of neurological deficits, white matter injury, and microgliosis following single TBI.

Patient-tailored strategies are strongly advocated to reduce unnecessary treatment while maximizing the oncological outcomes of patient who need active treatment in the primary, adjuvant or salvage setting. Recently, tissue-based biomarkers or genomic tests have become available to improve the clinical decision-making. Areas covered: In this review, the authors present recent evidence about these tissue-based biomarkers, discussing the application of each of them in the clinical setting, focusing on the tests aimed to provide a better risk stratification and to guide decision-making after the diagnosis of PCa (i.e. OncotypeDXⓇ, ProlarisⓇ, ProMarkⓇ, Ki-67, DecipherⓇ, PTEN, PORTOS, AR-V7 and DNA repair gene mutations). Expert commentary: Even if the clinicopathologic features are still the most frequently-used predictors of disease progression, these tools can be helpful in decision-making at every stage of the PCa management. Actually, OncotypeDXⓇ, ProlarisⓇ and DecipherⓇ are recommended in the clinical setting by guidelines at different steps of PCa management. Consequently, further studies are indispensable to better tailor the right therapy for the right patient and at the right time.",28277880,2017,Genomic tests to guide prostate cancer management following diagnosis.
96,"PURPOSE
Knowledge on what contributes to job satisfaction of people with intellectual disabilities is limited. Using self-determination theory, we investigated whether fulfillment of basic psychological needs (i.e., autonomy, relatedness, competence) affected job satisfaction, and explored associations between workplace participation, need fulfillment and job satisfaction.


METHOD
A total of 117 persons with intellectual disabilities, recruited from a Dutch care organization, were interviewed on need fulfillment at work and job satisfaction. Data on workplace participation was obtained from staff. Questionnaires were based on well-established instruments.


RESULTS
Basic psychological need fulfillment predicted higher levels of job satisfaction. Level of workplace participation was not associated with need fulfillment or job satisfaction.


CONCLUSIONS
Allowing workers with intellectual disabilities to act with a sense of volition, feel effective, able to meet challenges, and connected to others is essential and contributes to job satisfaction. It is needed to pay attention to this, both in selection and design of workplaces and in support style. Implications for rehabilitation Knowledge on factors that contribute to job satisfaction is necessary to improve employment situations and employment success of people with intellectual disabilities. In order to achieve job satisfaction, it is essential that workplaces allow for fulfillment of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence of people with intellectual disabilities. People with intellectual disabilities are able to report on their needs and satisfaction, and it is important that their own perspective is taken into account in decisions regarding their employment situation.",28288522,2018,Job satisfaction of people with intellectual disabilities: the role of basic psychological need fulfillment and workplace participation.
97,"In several countries, personal income tax permits tax credits for out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure. Tax credits benefit taxpayers at all income levels by reducing their net tax liability and modify the price of out-of-pocket expenditure. To the extent that consumer demand is price elastic, they may influence the amount of eligible healthcare expenditure for which taxpayers may claim a credit. These effects influence, in turn, income distributions and taxpayers' health status and therefore income-related inequality in health. Redistributive consequences of tax credits have been widely investigated. However, little is known about the ability of tax credits to alleviate health inequality. In this paper, we study the potential effects that tax credits for health expenses may have on income-related inequality in health status with reference to the Italian institutional setting. The analysis is performed using a tax-benefit microsimulation model that reproduces the personal income tax and incorporates taxpayers' behavioral responses to changes in tax credit rate. Our results suggest that the current healthcare tax credit design tends to favor the richest part of the population.",28299492,2018,Do healthcare tax credits help poor-health individuals on low incomes?
98,"Exclusionary immigration policies, as a form of structural racism, have led to a sizeable undocumented population that is largely barred from access to resources in the United States. Existing research suggests that undocumented immigration status detrimentally impacts mobility, yet few studies have tested the impacts of legal status on psychological wellbeing. Most importantly, we know little about how changes to legal status impact wellbeing. Announced in 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program allows eligible undocumented youth to apply for temporary lawful status. Drawing on cross-sectional survey data from 487 Latino immigrant young adults in California collected in 2014 and 2015, we analyze the predictors of three specialized outcomes related to immigrants' psychological wellbeing-distress, negative emotions, and deportation worry before and after a transition from undocumented to lawfully present status. Results show that retrospective reports of past psychological wellness, when all respondents were undocumented, are predicted primarily by socioeconomic status. However, reports of current psychological wellness are predicted by DACA status. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the positive emotional consequences of transitioning out of undocumented status for immigrant young adults.",28318760,2018,From undocumented to lawfully present: Do changes to legal status impact psychological wellbeing among latino immigrant young adults?
99,"Ts1Cje mice have a segmental trisomy of chromosome 16 that is orthologous to human chromosome 21 and display Down syndrome-like cognitive impairments. Despite the occurrence of affective and emotional impairments in patients with Down syndrome, these parameters are poorly documented in Down syndrome mouse models, including Ts1Cje mice. Here, we conducted comprehensive behavioral analyses, including anxiety-, sociability-, and depression-related tasks, and biochemical analyses of monoamines and their metabolites in Ts1Cje mice. Ts1Cje mice showed enhanced locomotor activity in novel environments and increased social contact with unfamiliar partners when compared with wild-type littermates, but a significantly lower activity in familiar environments. Ts1Cje mice also exhibited some signs of decreased depression like-behavior. Furthermore, Ts1Cje mice showed monoamine abnormalities, including increased extracellular dopamine and serotonin, and enhanced catabolism in the striatum and ventral forebrain.

100,"l-DOPA remains the benchmark treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms, but chronic use leads to l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). The serotonin (5-HT) system has been established as a key modulator of LID and 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR) stimulation has been shown to convey anti-dyskinetic effects. However, 5-HT1AR agonists often compromise clinical efficacy or display intrinsic side effects and their site(s) of actions remain debatable. Recently, highly selective G-protein biased 5-HT1AR agonists, F13714 and F15599, were shown to potently target 5-HT1A auto- or hetero-receptors, respectively. The current investigation sought to identify the signaling mechanisms and neuroanatomical substrates by which 5-HT1AR produce behavioral effects. In experiment 1, hemi-parkinsonian, l-DOPA-primed rats received systemic injections of vehicle, F13714 (0.01 or 0.02mg/kg), or F15599 (0.06 or 0.12mg/kg) 5min prior to l-DOPA (6mg/kg), after which LID, motor performance and 5-HT syndrome were rated. Both compounds significantly reduced LID, without affecting motor performance, however, acute administration of F13714 significantly induced 5-HT syndrome at anti-dyskinetic doses. In experiment 2, we elucidated the role of striatal 5-HT1AR in the effects of F13714 and F15599. Hemi-parkinsonian, l-DOPA-primed rats received bilateral intra-striatal microinjections of either F13714 (0, 2 or 10μg/side) or F15599 (0, 10 or 30μg/side) 5min prior to systemic l-DOPA (6mg/kg). Intra-striatal effects mimicked systemic effects, suggesting that striatal 5-HT1AR sub-populations play an important role in the anti-LID and pro-5-HT syndrome profiles of F13714 and F15599. Finally, in experiment 3, we examined the effects of F13714 and F15599 on D1 receptor (D1R) agonist-induced dyskinesia by administering either compound 5min prior to SKF 38393 (2mg/kg). While F13714 resulted in a mild delay in D1R-mediated dyskinesia, F15599 had no effect. Collectively these data suggest that the F-series compounds articulate their anti-LID effects through activation of a diverse set of striatal 5-HT1A hetero-receptor populations.",28342749,2017,Characterizing the differential roles of striatal 5-HT1A auto- and hetero-receptors in the reduction of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
101,"A neurochemical target at which cannabinoids interact to have global effects on behavior is brain noradrenergic circuitry. Acute and repeated administration of a cannabinoid receptor synthetic agonist is capable of increasing multiple indices of noradrenergic activity. This includes cannabinoid-induced 1) increases in norepinephrine (NE) release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); 2) desensitization of cortical α2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects; 3) activation of c-Fos in brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons; and 4) increases in anxiety-like behaviors. In the present study, we sought to examine adaptations in adrenoceptor expression and function under conditions of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1r) deletion using knockout (KO) mice and compare these to wild type (WT) controls. Electrophysiological analysis of α2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mPFC slices in WT mice showed a clonidine-induced α2-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in mPFC cell excitability coupled with an increase in input resistance. In contrast, CB1r KO mice showed an α2-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in mPFC cell excitability. We then examined protein expression levels of α2- and β1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the mPFC as well as TH expression in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mice deficient in CB1r. Both α2- and β1-adrenoceptors exhibited a significant decrease in expression levels in CB1r KO mice when compared to WT in the mPFC, while a significant increase in TH was observed in the LC. To better define whether the same cortical neurons express α2A-adrenoceptor and CB1r in mPFC, we utilized high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. We localized α2A-adrenoceptors in a knock-in mouse that expressed a hemoagglutinin (HA) tag downstream of the α2A-adrenoceptor promoter. Although the α2A-adrenoceptor was often identified pre-synaptically, we observed co-localization of CB1r with α2-adrenoceptors post-synaptically in the same mPFC neurons. Finally, using receptor binding, we confirmed prior results showing that α2A-adrenoceptor is unchanged in mPFC following acute or chronic exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, but is increased, following chronic treatment followed by a period of abstinence. Taken together, these data provide convergent lines of evidence indicating cannabinoid regulation of the cortical adrenergic system.",28341460,2017,"Cortical adrenoceptor expression, function and adaptation under conditions of cannabinoid receptor deletion."
102,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the gene huntingtin. There is no treatment to prevent or delay the disease course of HD currently. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as key determinants of the disease progression in HD. Therefore, counteracting mutant huntingtin (mHtt)-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction appears as a new approach to treat this devastating disease. Interestingly, mild mitochondrial uncoupling improves neuronal resistance to stress and facilitates neuronal survival. Mild mitochondrial uncoupling can be induced by the proper dose of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a proton ionophore that was previously used for weight loss. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic administration of DNP at three doses (0.5, 1, 5mg/kg/day) on mHtt-induced behavioral deficits and cellular abnormalities in the N171-82Q HD mouse model. DNP at a low dose (1mg/kg/day) significantly improved motor function and preserved medium spiny neuronal marker DARPP32 and postsynaptic protein PSD95 in the striatum of HD mice. Further mechanistic study suggests that DNP at this dose reduced oxidative stress in HD mice, which was indicated by reduced levels of F2-isoprostanes in the brain of HD mice treated with DNP. Our data indicated that DNP provided behavioral benefit and neuroprotective effect at a weight neutral dose in HD mice, suggesting that the potential value of repositioning DNP to HD treatment is warranted in well-controlled clinical trials in HD.",28359739,2017,"2,4 DNP improves motor function, preserves medium spiny neuronal identity, and reduces oxidative stress in a mouse model of Huntington's disease."
103,"PURPOSE
To measure self-efficacy in a group of individuals who have undergone a lower-limb amputation and investigate the relationship between self-efficacy and prosthetic-specific outcomes including prosthetic use, mobility, amputation-related problems and global health. A second purpose was to examine if differences exist in outcomes based upon the type of prosthetic knee unit being used.


METHOD
Cross-sectional study using the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale and the Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation (Q-TFA). Forty-two individuals participated in the study. Twenty-three used a non-microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joint (non-MPK) and 19 used a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joint (MPK).


RESULTS
The study sample had quite high GSE scores (32/40). GSE scores were significantly correlated to the Q-TFA prosthetic use, mobility and problem scores. High GSE scores were related to higher levels of prosthetic use, mobility, global scores and negatively related to problem score. No significant difference was observed between individuals using a non-MPK versus MPK joints.


CONCLUSIONS
Individuals with high self-efficacy used their prosthesis to a higher degree and high self-efficacy was related to higher level of mobility, global scores and fewer problems related to the amputation in individuals who have undergone a lower-limb amputation and were using a non-MPK or MPK knee. Implications for rehabilitation Perceived self-efficacy has has been shown to be related to quality of life, prosthetic mobility and capability as well as social activities in daily life.

104,"Insomnia is a major public health problem considering its high prevalence, impact on daily life, co-morbidity with other disorders and societal costs. Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) is currently considered to be the preferred treatment. However, no meta-analysis exists of all studies using at least one component of CBTI for insomnia, which also uses modern techniques to pool data and to analyze subgroups of patients. We included 87 randomized controlled trials, comparing 118 treatments (3724 patients) to non-treated controls (2579 patients). Overall, the interventions had significant effects on: insomnia severity index (g = 0.98), sleep efficiency (g = 0.71), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (g = 0.65), wake after sleep onset (g = 0.63) and sleep onset latency (SOL; g = 0.57), number of awakenings (g = 0.29) and sleep quality (g = 0.40). The smallest effect was on total sleep time (g = 0.16). Face-to-face treatments of at least four sessions seem to be more effective than self-help interventions or face-to-face interventions with fewer sessions. Otherwise the results seem to be quite robust (similar for patients with or without comorbid disease, younger or older patients, using or not using sleep medication). We conclude that CBTI, either its components or the full package, is effective in the treatment of insomnia.",28392168,2018,Cognitive and behavioral therapies in the treatment of insomnia: A meta-analysis.

106,"Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A, encoding the Nav1.1 channel, are responsible for a number of epilepsy disorders including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (DS). Patients with SCN1A mutations often experience prolonged early-life febrile seizures (FSs), raising the possibility that these events may influence epileptogenesis and lead to more severe adult phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we subjected 21-23-day-old mice expressing the human SCN1A GEFS+ mutation R1648H to prolonged hyperthermia, and then examined seizure and behavioral phenotypes during adulthood. We found that early-life FSs resulted in lower latencies to induced seizures, increased severity of spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and impairments in social behavior and recognition memory during adulthood. Biophysical analysis of brain slice preparations revealed an increase in epileptiform activity in CA3 pyramidal neurons along with increased action potential firing, providing a mechanistic basis for the observed worsening of adult phenotypes. These findings demonstrate the long-term negative impact of early-life FSs on disease outcomes. This has important implications for the clinical management of this patient population and highlights the need for therapeutic interventions that could ameliorate disease progression.",28373025,2017,Early-life febrile seizures worsen adult phenotypes in Scn1a mutants.

Results supported a two-factor externalizing model where reactive and proactive relational aggression and deception loaded on one externalizing factor and reactive and proactive physical aggression and hyperactivity loaded on another externalizing factor.",28401324,2018,Testing a Higher Order Model of Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior: The Role of Aggression Subtypes.
108,"Introduction
Most women who quit smoking during pregnancy will relapse postpartum. Interventions for sustained postpartum abstinence can benefit from understanding prenatal characteristics associated with treatment response. Given that individuals with psychiatric disorders or elevated depressive symptoms have difficulty quitting smoking and that increases in depressive symptoms prenatally are common, we examined the relevance of psychiatric diagnoses, prenatal depressive symptoms, and stress to postpartum relapse prevention intervention response.


Methods
Pregnant women (N = 300) who quit smoking during pregnancy received intervention (with specialized focus on mood, weight, and stress [STARTS] or a comparison [SUPPORT]) to prevent postpartum relapse. As previously published, nearly one-third and one-quarter of women achieved biochemically-confirmed sustained abstinence at 24- and 52-weeks postpartum, with no difference in abstinence rates between the interventions. Women completed psychiatric interviews and questionnaires during pregnancy. Smoking was assessed in pregnancy, and 24- and 52-weeks postpartum.


Results
Psychiatric disorders did not predict sustained abstinence or treatment response. However, treatment response was moderated by end-of-pregnancy depressive symptoms (χ2 = 9.98, p = .002) and stress (χ2 = 6.90, p = .01) at 24- and 52-weeks postpartum and remained significant after including covariates. Women with low distress achieved higher abstinence rates in SUPPORT than in STARTS (37% vs. 19% for depressive symptoms; 36% vs. 19% for stress), with no difference for women with high symptoms.


Conclusions
Prenatal depressive symptoms and stress predicted differential treatment efficacy in women with low symptoms, not in women with high symptoms. Diagnostic history did not predict treatment differences. Future research to address prenatal distress may help tailor postpartum relapse prevention interventions.


Implications
We examined prenatal history of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric distress as moderators of response to postpartum smoking relapse prevention intervention that either included or did not include added content on mood, stress, and weight concerns. For women with lower psychiatric distress, the added focus is not necessary, as these women achieved greater sustained abstinence in the less-intensive treatment. Understanding which women need which level of care to sustain abstinence can help allocate resources for all postpartum former smokers. These findings underscore the importance of perinatal symptom monitoring and promoting behavioral health more broadly in pregnant and postpartum women.",28403471,2017,Do Psychiatric Disorders or Measures of Distress Moderate Response to Postpartum Relapse Prevention Interventions?
109,"Symptom accommodation-behaviors that family members engage in either to prevent or alleviate a loved one's anxiety-is ubiquitous in families with relatives affected by fear-based disorders (FBDs), yet little research has examined the extent to which certain psychological factors predict symptom accommodation. The current study examined several potential predictors (e.g., empathic concern) among co-residing relatives of individuals diagnosed with FBDs. Participants (n = 53) completed a series of clinical interviews and self report measures. Results indicated that accommodation occurred to similar degrees across relatives with various relationships to the individual with a FBD, as well as across different FBDs. Further, the predictors jointly explained a significant amount of variance in accommodation; although, no single construct emerged as a unique predictor. Empathic concern and expressed emotion emerged as marginally significant predictors of symptom accommodation.

110,"Deletions and reciprocal triplications of the human chromosomal 15q11-13 region cause two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. Maternally-derived deletions or inactivating mutations of UBE3A, a 15q11-13 gene expressed exclusively from the maternal allele in neurons, cause Angelman syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, motor deficits, seizures, and a characteristic increased social smiling, laughing, and eye contact. Conversely, maternally-derived triplications of 15q11-13 cause a behavioral disorder on the autism spectrum with clinical features that include decreased sociability that we recently reconstituted in mice with Ube3a alone. Based on the unique sociability features reported in Angelman syndrome and the repressed sociability observed when Ube3a gene dosage is increased, we hypothesized that mice with neuronal UBE3A loss that models Angelman syndrome would display evidence of hypersocial behavior. We report that mice with maternally-inherited Ube3a gene deletion (Ube3amKO) have a prolonged preference for, and interaction with, social stimuli in the three chamber social approach task. By contrast, interactions with a novel object are reduced. Further, ultrasonic vocalizations and physical contacts are increased in male and female Ube3amKO mice paired with an unfamiliar genotype-matched female. Single housing wild type mice increased these same social behavior parameters to levels observed in Ube3amKO mice where this effect was partially occluded. These results indicate sociability is repressed by social experience and the endogenous levels of UBE3A protein and suggest some social behavioral features observed in Angelman syndrome may reflect an increased social motivation.",28411125,2017,Hypersociability in the Angelman syndrome mouse model.
111,"Peripheral inflammation induces sensitization of nociceptive spinal cord neurons. Both spinal tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and neuronal membrane insertion of Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptor (AMPAr) contribute to spinal sensitization and resultant pain behavior, molecular mechanisms connecting these two events have not been studied in detail. Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of TNF-blockers attenuated paw carrageenan-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. Levels of GluA1 and GluA4 from dorsal spinal membrane fractions increased in carrageenan-injected rats compared to controls. In the same tissue, GluA2 levels were not altered. Inflammation-induced increases in membrane GluA1 were prevented by i.t. pre-treatment with antagonists to TNF, PI3K, PKA and NMDA. Interestingly, administration of TNF or PI3K inhibitors followed by carrageenan caused a marked reduction in plasma membrane GluA2 levels, despite the fact that membrane GluA2 levels were stable following inhibitor administration in the absence of carrageenan. TNF pre-incubation induced increased numbers of Co2+ labeled dorsal horn neurons, indicating more neurons with Ca2+ permeable AMPAr. In parallel to Western blot results, this increase was blocked by antagonism of PI3K and PKA. In addition, spinal slices from GluA1 transgenic mice, which had a single alanine replacement at GluA1 ser 845 or ser 831 that prevented phosphorylation, were resistant to TNF-induced increases in Co2+ labeling. However, behavioral responses following intraplantar carrageenan and formalin in the mutant mice were no different from littermate controls, suggesting a more complex regulation of nociception. Co-localization of GluA1, GluA2 and GluA4 with synaptophysin on identified spinoparabrachial neurons and their relative ratios were used to assess inflammation-induced trafficking of AMPAr to synapses. Inflammation induced an increase in synaptic GluA1, but not GluA2. Although total GluA4 also increased with inflammation, co-localization of GluA4 with synaptophysin, fell short of significance. Taken together these data suggest that peripheral inflammation induces a PI3K and PKA dependent TNFR1 activated pathway that culminates with trafficking of calcium permeable AMPAr into synapses of nociceptive dorsal horn projection neurons.",28412220,2017,"Inflammation-induced GluA1 trafficking and membrane insertion of Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptors in dorsal horn neurons is dependent on spinal tumor necrosis factor, PI3 kinase and protein kinase A."
112,"BACKGROUND
Experimentally studying the influence of social environments on mental health and behavior is challenging, as social context is difficult to standardize in laboratory settings. Virtual Reality (VR) enables studying social interaction in terms of interpersonal distance in a more ecologically valid manner. Regulation of interpersonal distance may be abnormal in patients with psychotic disorders and influenced by environmental stress, symptoms or distress.


AIMS
To investigate interpersonal distance in people with a psychotic disorder and at ultrahigh risk for psychosis (UHR) compared to siblings and controls in virtual social environments, and explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and interpersonal distance.


METHODS
Nineteen UHR patients, 52 patients with psychotic disorders, 40 siblings of patients with a psychotic disorder and 47 controls were exposed to virtual cafés. In five virtual café visits, participants were exposed to different levels of social stress, in terms of crowdedness, ethnicity and hostility. Measures on interpersonal distance, distress and state paranoia were obtained. Baseline measures included trait paranoia, social anxiety, depressive, positive and negative symptoms.


RESULTS
Interpersonal distance increased when social stressors were present in the environment. No difference in interpersonal distance regulation was found between the groups. Social anxiety and distress were positively associated with interpersonal distance in the total sample.


CONCLUSION
This VR paradigm indicates that interpersonal distance regulation in response to environmental social stressors is unaltered in people with psychosis or UHR. Environmental stress, social anxiety and distress trigger both people with and without psychosis to maintain larger interpersonal distances in social situations.",28442248,2018,Social environments and interpersonal distance regulation in psychosis: A virtual reality study.

Evaluate the effect of paliperidone palmitate once-monthly (PP1M) injectable on the specific functioning domains of the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale in patients with schizoaffective disorder (SCA) participating in a long-term study.


METHODS
This study (NCT01193153) included both in- and outpatient subjects with SCA experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic and mood symptoms. Subjects were treated with PP1M either as monotherapy or in combination with antidepressants or mood stabilizers during a 25-week open-label (OL) phase. Stabilized subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 (PP1M or placebo) into a 15-month double-blind (DB) relapse-prevention period. Functioning of the randomized subjects during OL and DB phases was evaluated using the PSP scale (four domains: socially useful activities, personal/social relationships, self-care, and disturbing/aggressive behaviors). Three statistical approaches were utilized to analyze PSP scores to assess robustness and consistency of findings. No adjustments were made for multiplicity.


RESULTS
334 of 667 enrolled subjects were stabilized with PP1M, randomly assigned to PP1M (n=164) or placebo (n=170) in the DB phase, and included in this analysis. Improvements in all PSP domain scores were observed during the OL phase and were maintained during the DB phase with PP1M, but decreased with placebo. Differences compared to placebo were significant in all four PSP domains during the DB phase (P≤0.008).

114,"Neuropsychiatric disorders have a complex genetic architecture. Human genetic population-based studies have identified numerous heritable sequence and structural genomic variants associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease. However, these germline variants do not fully account for disease risk. During brain development, progenitor cells undergo billions of cell divisions to generate the ~80 billion neurons in the brain. The failure to accurately repair DNA damage arising during replication, transcription, and cellular metabolism amid this dramatic cellular expansion can lead to somatic mutations. Somatic mutations that alter subsets of neuronal transcriptomes and proteomes can, in turn, affect cell proliferation and survival and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. The long life span of individual neurons and the direct relationship between neural circuits and behavior suggest that somatic mutations in small populations of neurons can significantly affect individual neurodevelopment. The Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network has been founded to study somatic mosaicism both in neurotypical human brains and in the context of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.",28450582,2017,Intersection of diverse neuronal genomes and neuropsychiatric disease: The Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network.
115,"The typical environmental enrichment (EE) paradigm, which consists of continuous exposure after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), promotes behavioral and histological benefits. However, rehabilitation is often abbreviated in the clinic and administered in multiple daily sessions. While recent studies have demonstrated that a once daily 6-hr bout of EE confers benefits comparable to continuous EE, breaking the therapy into two shorter sessions may increase novelty and ultimately enhance recovery. Hence, the aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that functional and histological outcomes will be significantly improved by daily preclinical neurorehabilitation consisting of two 3-hr periods of EE vs. a single 6-hr session. Anesthetized adult male rats received a controlled cortical impact of moderate-to-severe injury (2.8mm tissue deformation at 4m/s) or sham surgery and were then randomly assigned to groups receiving standard (STD) housing, a single 6-hr session of EE, or two 3-hr sessions of EE daily for 3weeks. Motor function (beam-balance/traversal) and acquisition of spatial learning/memory retention (Morris water maze) were assessed on post-operative days 1-5 and 14-19, respectively. Cortical lesion volume was quantified on day 21. Both EE conditions improved motor function and acquisition of spatial learning, and reduced cortical lesion volume relative to STD housing (p<0.05), but did not differ from one another in any endpoint (p>0.05). The findings replicate previous work showing that 6-hr of EE daily is sufficient to confer behavioral and histological benefits after TBI and extend the findings by demonstrating that the benefits are comparable regardless of how the 6-hrs of EE are accrued. The relevance of the finding is that it can be extrapolated to the clinic and may benefit patients who cannot endure a single extended period of neurorehabilitation.",28457905,2017,Refining environmental enrichment to advance rehabilitation based research after experimental traumatic brain injury.
116,"Disruption of normal circadian rhythm physiology is associated with neurodegenerative disease, which can lead to symptoms such as altered sleep cycles. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian dysfunction has been attributed to β-amyloidosis. However, it is unclear whether tauopathy, another AD-associated neuropathology, can disrupt the circadian clock. We have evaluated the status of the circadian clock in a mouse model of tauopathy (Tg4510). Tg4510 mice display a long free-running period at an age when tauopathy is present, and show evidence of tauopathy in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus - the site of the master circadian clock. Additionally, cyclic expression of the core clock protein PER2 is disrupted in the hypothalamus of Tg4510 mice. Finally, disruption of the cyclic expression of PER2 and BMAL1, another core circadian clock protein, is evident in the Tg4510 hippocampus. These results demonstrate that tauopathy disrupts normal circadian clock function both at the behavioral and molecular levels, which may be attributed to the tauopathy-induced neuropathology in the SCN. Furthermore, these results establish the Tg4510 mouse line as a model to study how tauopathy disrupts normal circadian rhythm biology.",28461004,2017,Disruption of normal circadian clock function in a mouse model of tauopathy.
117,"Capsaicin, the ingredient responsible for the pungent taste of hot chili peppers, is widely used in the study and management of pain. Recently, its neuroprotective effect has been described in multiple studies. Herein, we investigated the underlying mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of capsaicin. Direct injection of capsaicin (1 or 3nmol) into the peri-infarct area reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological behavioral scoring and motor coordination function in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion model in rats. The time window of the protective effect of capsaicin was within 1h after reperfusion, when excitotoxicity is the main reason of cell death. In cultured cortical neurons, administration of capsaicin attenuated glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury. With respect to the mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect of capsaicin, reduced calcium influx after glutamate stimulation was observed following capsaicin pretreatment in cortical neurons. Trpv1 knock-out abolished the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on glutamate-induced calcium influx and subsequent neuronal death. Reduced expression of GluN1 and GluN2B, subunits of NMDA receptor, was examined after capsaicin treatment in cortical neurons. In summary, our studies reveal that the neuroprotective effect of capsaicin in cortical neurons is TRPV1-dependent and down-regulation of the expression and function of NMDA receptors contributes to the protection afforded by capsaicin.",28479337,2017,Capsaicin protects cortical neurons against ischemia/reperfusion injury via down-regulating NMDA receptors.
118,"OBJECTIVES
Open surgery is performed to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), although the subsequent surgical stress leads to worse physical status. Preoperative self-efficacy has been reported to predict postoperative physical status after orthopedic surgery; however, it has not been sufficiently investigated in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the correlation between preoperative self-efficacy and postoperative six-minute walk distance (6MWD) in open AAA surgery.


METHODS
Seventy patients who underwent open AAA surgery were included. Functional exercise capacity was measured using preoperative and 1 week postoperative 6MWD. Self-efficacy was preoperatively measured using self-efficacy for physical activity (SEPA). The correlations of postoperative 6MWD with age, height, BMI, preoperative 6MWD, SEPA, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, operative time, and blood loss were investigated using multivariate analysis.


RESULTS
Single regression analysis showed that postoperative 6MWD was significantly correlated with age (r = -0.553, p ≤ 0.001), height (r = 0.292, p = 0.014), Charlson's comorbidity index (r = -0.268, p = 0.025), preoperative 6MWD (r = 0.572, p ≤ 0.001), SEPA (r = 0.586, p ≤ 0.001), and HADS-depression (r = -0.296, p = 0.013). Multiple regression analysis showed that age (p = 0.002), preoperative 6MWD (p = 0.013), and SEPA (p = 0.043) score were significantly correlated with postoperative 6MWD.


CONCLUSIONS
Self-efficacy was an independent predictor for postoperative 6MWD after elective open AAA surgery. This suggests the importance of assessing not only physical status but also psychological factors such as self-efficacy. Implications for Rehabilitation Preoperative self-efficacy has been limited to reports after orthopedic surgery. We showed that preoperative self-efficacy predicted postoperative 6MWD after AAA surgery. Treatment to improve self-efficacy might be useful in patients receiving AAA surgery in rehabilitation.",28486829,2018,Self-efficacy is an independent predictor for postoperative six-minute walk distance after elective open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
119,"Glucocorticoid steroids such as prednisone are prescribed for chronic muscle conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where their use is associated with prolonged ambulation. The positive effects of chronic steroid treatment in muscular dystrophy are paradoxical because these steroids are also known to trigger muscle atrophy. Chronic steroid use usually involves once-daily dosing, although weekly dosing in children has been suggested for its reduced side effects on behavior. In this work, we tested steroid dosing in mice and found that a single pulse of glucocorticoid steroids improved sarcolemmal repair through increased expression of annexins A1 and A6, which mediate myofiber repair. This increased expression was dependent on glucocorticoid response elements upstream of annexins and was reinforced by the expression of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). We compared weekly versus daily steroid treatment in mouse models of acute muscle injury and in muscular dystrophy and determined that both regimens provided comparable benefits in terms of annexin gene expression and muscle repair. However, daily dosing activated atrophic pathways, including F-box protein 32 (Fbxo32), which encodes atrogin-1. Conversely, weekly steroid treatment in mdx mice improved muscle function and histopathology and concomitantly induced the ergogenic transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (Klf15) while decreasing Fbxo32. These findings suggest that intermittent, rather than daily, glucocorticoid steroid regimen promotes sarcolemmal repair and muscle recovery from injury while limiting atrophic remodeling.",28481224,2017,Intermittent glucocorticoid steroid dosing enhances muscle repair without eliciting muscle atrophy.
120,"PURPOSE
To assess the longitudinal evolution of tactical behaviors used to medal in men's 800-m Olympic Games (OG) or world-championship (WC) events in the recent competition era (2000-2016).


METHODS
Thirteen OG and WC events were characterized for 1st- and 2nd-lap splits using available footage from YouTube. Positive pacing strategies were defined as a faster 1st lap. Season's best 800-m time and world ranking, reflective of an athlete's ""peak condition,"" were obtained to determine relationships between adopted tactics and physical condition prior to the championships. Seven championship events provided coverage of all medalists to enable determination of average 100-m speed and sector pacing of medalists.


RESULTS
From 2011 onward, 800-m OG and WC medalists showed a faster 1st lap by 2.2 ± 1.1 s (mean, ±90% confidence limits; large difference, very likely), contrasting a possibly faster 2nd lap from 2000 to 2009 (0.5, ±0.4 s; moderate difference). A positive pacing strategy was related to a higher world ranking prior to the championships (r = .94, .84-.98; extremely large, most likely). After 2011, the fastest 100-m sector from 800-m OG and WC medalists was faster than before 2009 by 0.5, ±0.2 m/s (large difference, most likely).


CONCLUSIONS
A secular change in tactical racing behavior appears evident in 800-m championships; since 2011, medalists have largely run faster 1st laps and have faster 100-m sector-speed requirements. This finding may be pertinent for training, tactical preparation, and talent identification of athletes preparing for 800-m running at OGs and WCs.",28488905,2018,Tactical Behaviors in Men's 800-m Olympic and World-Championship Medalists: A Changing of the Guard.
121,"BACKGROUND
There have been no systematic reviews that investigated the heritability of the two-factor model of psychopathy: interpersonal-affective and behavioral. Our review aimed, first, to examine the heritability of general psychopathic traits and, second, if genetic influences were suggested, to determine the heritability of various traits related to the interpersonal-affective and behavioral factors of psychopathy.


METHOD
A systematic literature search was conducted using articles from the PsycINFO, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (January of 1980 to December of 2015) in order to identify eligible literature that reported on the heritability of psychopathy-related traits. Papers were also found via manual examination and reference tracking. Papers were subjected to exclusion criteria and quality appraisal. We identified a total of 24 studies.


RESULTS
Our results were grouped into three categories: general, interpersonal-affective, and behavioral. All these areas demonstrated modest to high heritability. The highest heritability values were found in studies investigating callous-unemotional behaviors.


CONCLUSIONS
Heritability was found for all the psychopathic traits. Future research should include endophenotypic approaches that explore gene-environment correlations, which could aid in identification of the behavioral phenotype that is most amenable to early intervention by way of moderation of genetic risk.",28490392,2018,A systematic review of the heritability of specific psychopathic traits using Hare's two-factor model of psychopathy.
122,"Accumulating evidence supports that activation of inflammatory pathways is a crucial factor contributing to the pathogenesis of seizures. In particular, the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) system exerts proconvulsant effects in a large variety of seizure models. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a critical adaptor protein in the signaling cascade elicited by IL-1β. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of MyD88 in rat models of seizures and in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and to study the role of MyD88 in epileptic seizures. Our results revealed that MyD88 was up-regulated in the hippocampus of rats in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute seizures. Importantly, MyD88 overexpression was also significantly present in the brain from chronic epileptic rats and the temporal neocortex specimens from drug-resistant TLE patients. In the acute seizure model, both the behavioral and electrographic seizure activities were record and analyzed in rats for 90min, starting immediately after pilocarpine injection. ST2825, a synthetic MyD88 inhibitor, was administered intracerebroventricularly (2.5-5.0-10μg in 2μl) 20min before pilocarpine injection. We found that ST2825 at doses of 5μg and 10μg significantly inhibited the pilocarpine-induced behavioral and electrographic seizures. Moreover, 10μg ST2825 prevented the proconvulsant actions of IL-1β. As previous evidence suggested that IL-1β proconvulsant effects was mediated by enhancing the phosphorylation level of the NR2B subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, we then probed whether this molecular was involved in the effect of the pharmacological inhibition. Our results revealed that 10μg ST2825 markedly reversed the increased Tyr1472-phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor observed in the proconvulsant conditions of IL-1β and in seizures induced by pilocarpine alone. These findings indicate that altered expression of MyD88 might contribute to the pathogenesis of seizures and targeting of this adaptor protein might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress seizure activities.",28529112,2017,Myeloid differentiation factor 88 is up-regulated in epileptic brain and contributes to experimental seizures in rats.
123,"Although several investigations-on primarily adult samples-demonstrate a potential role of emotion dysregulation in the etiology and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), investigations into the mechanisms that may underlie these associations in general and among adolescents in particular are lacking. The present study examined associations among emotional clarity (i.e., the extent to which individuals are confused about the specific emotions they are experiencing), (Gratz, Journal of Psychopathology Behavioral Assessment 26(1):41-54, 2004) anxiety sensitivity, and DSM-IV PTSD symptom cluster severity (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms) in a diverse sample of trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents. It was hypothesized that anxiety sensitivity would underlie association between emotional clarity and PTSD symptoms. Participants (N = 50; 52.0% female; M age = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51; 44% White) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, anxiety sensitivity, and PTSD. Lower emotional clarity was significantly associated with greater total PTSD symptoms, as well as re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal symptoms. Additionally, there were indirect effects for lack of emotional clarity via anxiety sensitivity in relation to total PTSD symptoms [B = 0.17, SE = 0.08, BC 95% CI (0.04, 0.35)], re-experiencing symptoms [B = 0.15, SE = 0.08, BC 95% CI (0.03, 0.36)], avoidance symptoms [B = 0.12, SE = 0.07, BC 95% CI (0.02, 0.29)], and hyperarousal symptoms [B = 0.17, SE = 0.08, BC 95% CI (0.04, 0.36)]. Reversed models were violated, supporting the direction of hypothesized effects. Difficulties recognizing and accurately understanding emotions may increase risk for PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed youth. Furthermore, anxiety sensitivity may be a promising intervention target among youth at risk for PTSD, especially among those demonstrating poorer emotional clarity.",28536961,2018,"Emotional Clarity, Anxiety Sensitivity, and PTSD Symptoms Among Trauma-Exposed Inpatient Adolescents."
124,"OBJECTIVE
The Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) is a structured clinical interview that is widely used for assessing disordered eating. Although the EDE has been used in pregnant women, no standard pregnancy version has been developed. Accordingly, the present study aimed to document adaptations made to a pregnancy version of the EDE (EDE-PV) and to describe the internal reliability of this adapted version.


METHOD
Three major modifications were made in the development of the EDE-PV. First, disordered eating was assessed during and prior to pregnancy to account for changes across the perinatal period. Second, items were adapted and rules governing ratings were altered to distinguish eating attitudes and behaviors that are considered normative during pregnancy from disordered eating. Third, several items were omitted.


RESULTS
The EDE-PV was administered to 129 women with overweight and obesity who were between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. Women were 27.25 (SD = 5.48) years of age and 56% were African American. Women endorsed low levels of disordered eating on the EDE-PV, and the internal reliability was similar to previous reports.

125,"In promoting optimal recovery in persons with psychosis, psychological interventions have become a key element of treatment, with cognitive behavioural therapy being widely recommended in clinical practice guidelines. One key area of development has been the trialling of ""third wave"" cognitive behavioural interventions, which promote mindfulness, acceptance and compassion as means of change. Trials to date have demonstrated encouraging findings, with beneficial effects observed on measures of psychotic symptoms. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of third wave interventions for the treatment of psychosis in randomised controlled trials, with psychotic symptoms as the primary outcome. Overall, 10 studies were included. The primary outcome demonstrated a small but significant effect (g=0.29) for third wave interventions compared with control post-treatment. Trials of group format mindfulness-based interventions showed larger effects (g=0.46) than individual acceptance and commitment therapy based interventions (g=0.08), although methodological differences between trials were noted. Among secondary outcomes, a moderate, significant treatment effect (g=0.39) was found for depressive symptoms, but no significant effects were found on specific measures of positive and negative symptoms, hallucination distress, or functioning/disability. A moderate effect on mindfulness (g=0.56) was observed, but not on acceptance. Overall, findings indicate that third wave interventions show beneficial effects on symptoms in persons with psychotic disorders.

126,"Research on beneficial consequences of yoga focuses on the effects of yogic breathing and meditation. Less is known about the psychological effects of performing yoga postures. The present study investigated the effects of yoga poses on subjective sense of energy and self-esteem. The effects of yoga postures were compared to the effects of 'power poses,' which arguably increase the sense of power and self-confidence due to their association with interpersonal dominance (Carney et al., 2010). The study tested the novel prediction that yoga poses, which are not associated with interpersonal dominance but increase bodily energy, would increase the subjective feeling of energy and therefore increase self-esteem compared to 'high power' and 'low power' poses. A two factorial, between participants design was employed. Participants performed either two standing yoga poses with open front of the body (n = 19), two standing yoga poses with covered front of the body (n = 22), two expansive, high power poses (n = 21), or two constrictive, low power poses (n = 20) for 1-min each. The results showed that yoga poses in comparison to 'power poses' increased self-esteem. This effect was mediated by an increased subjective sense of energy and was observed when baseline trait self-esteem was controlled for. These results suggest that the effects of performing open, expansive body postures may be driven by processes other than the poses' association with interpersonal power and dominance. This study demonstrates that positive effects of yoga practice can occur after performing yoga poses for only 2 min.",28553249,2017,Yoga Poses Increase Subjective Energy and State Self-Esteem in Comparison to 'Power Poses'.
127,"The rapid growth in data sharing presents new opportunities across the spectrum of biomedical research. Global efforts are underway to develop practical guidance for implementation of data sharing and open data resources. These include the recent recommendation of 'FAIR Data Principles', which assert that if data is to have broad scientific value, then digital representations of that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The spinal cord injury (SCI) research field has a long history of collaborative initiatives that include sharing of preclinical research models and outcome measures. In addition, new tools and resources are being developed by the SCI research community to enhance opportunities for data sharing and access. With this in mind, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted a workshop on October 5-6, 2016 in Bethesda, MD, in collaboration with the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (ODC-SCI) titled ""Preclinical SCI Data: Creating a FAIR Share Community"". Workshop invitees were nominated by the workshop steering committee (co-chairs: ARF and VPL; members: AC, KDA, MSB, KF, LBJ, PGP, JMS), to bring together junior and senior level experts including preclinical and basic SCI researchers from academia and industry, data science and bioinformatics experts, investigators with expertise in other neurological disease fields, clinical researchers, members of the SCI community, and program staff representing federal and private funding agencies. The workshop and ODC-SCI efforts were sponsored by the International Spinal Research Trust (ISRT), the Rick Hansen Institute, Wings for Life, the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation and NINDS. The number of attendees was limited to ensure active participation and feedback in small groups. The goals were to examine the current landscape for data sharing in SCI research and provide a path to its future. Below are highlights from the workshop, including perspectives on the value of data sharing in SCI research, workshop participant perspectives and concerns, descriptions of existing resources and actionable directions for further engaging the SCI research community in a model that may be applicable to many other areas of neuroscience. This manuscript is intended to share these initial findings with the broader research community, and to provide talking points for continued feedback from the SCI field, as it continues to move forward in the age of data sharing.",28576567,2017,Developing a data sharing community for spinal cord injury research.
128,"BACKGROUND
Schizophrenia has a core feature of cognitive dysfunctions. Since these deficits are predictive for patients' functional outcome, understanding their origin is of great importance to improve their daily lives. A specific component of the deficit involves social decision-making, which can be studied using the Ultimatum Game (UG). In this task, a ""proposer"" proposes a share of money to a ""responder"", who can either accept or reject this offer. If the responder accepts the proposal, both win money. If the responder refuses, both players end up with nothing. Therefore, the UG evaluates decision-making strategies and social interaction.


METHODS
We compared the neuronal bases of schizophrenic patients with healthy controls, while performing the UG. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to find differences in the event-related potential (ERP) components typical for the UG, namely the P2 and feedback-related negativity (FRN). Source reconstruction was further used to define the origin of these differences.


RESULTS
In the proposer condition, no differences were found in amplitude of the P2 and FRN components. In contrast, in the responder condition, significant differences were found for the amplitude of the FRN (p=0.009). Using source reconstruction, a different activation in a border zone of the dorsolateral and the medial prefrontal cortex was revealed in schizophrenic patients to underlie this component.


CONCLUSIONS
We suggest that the difference found in the FRN amplitude is associated with difficulties of patients in interpreting another's behavior. Although schizophrenic patients correctly activate neuronal bases in the proposer condition, they were not able to activate the same networks in the responder condition, thereby exposing their difficulties in social interaction.",28578921,2018,Impaired social cognition in schizophrenia during the Ultimatum Game: An EEG study.

The aim of this study was to provide a short version of the Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (DACOBS), which is a self-report tool to assess cognitive distortions related to psychosis.


METHODS
A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on a large non-clinical sample (n=1207) and cross-validated with a confirmatory factor analysis on an independent non-clinical sample (n=653). Discriminative validity was performed by contrasting the high risk for psychosis non-clinical sample (n=63), low risk for psychosis non-clinical sample (n=152), patients with schizophrenia (n=105), and patients with depression (n=56). Correlations between symptoms, cognitive functions, source monitoring deficits, and jumping to conclusions were performed among a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia.


RESULTS
An 18-item scale (DACOBS-18) with a four-factor solution was established. Internal consistency (α=0.84) and test-retest reliability (r=0.84, p<0.001) were good. The DACOBS-18 has satisfactory discriminative power, with 99.1% sensitivity and 74.3% specificity in discriminating low risk for psychosis from schizophrenia patients. The DACOBS-18 subscales correlate significantly with psychotic symptoms and psychotic-like experiences. After Bonferroni correction, significant correlations between Safety Behaviors and neuropsychological functioning were found.


CONCLUSIONS
The DACOBS-18 is a reliable scale with satisfactory discriminative power and thus may be a valuable self-report screening tool for use in everyday clinical practice with psychotic patients and with people at risk for psychosis.

131,"Recently, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), primarily activated by binding of orthosteric agonists, represent a target for anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug development. These receptors may also be modulated by positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), ago-allosteric ligands (ago-PAMs), and α7-silent agonists. Activation of α7 nAChRs has been reported to increase the brain levels of endogenous ligands for nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors type-α (PPAR-α), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here, we investigated potential crosstalk between α7 nAChR and PPAR-α, using the formalin test, a mouse model of tonic pain. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that PNU282987, a full α7 agonist, attenuated formalin-induced nociceptive behavior in α7-dependent manner. Interestingly, the selective PPAR-α antagonist GW6471 blocked the antinociceptive effects of PNU282987, but did not alter the antinociceptive responses evoked by the α7 nAChR PAM PNU120596, ago-PAM GAT107, and silent agonist NS6740. Moreover, GW6471 administered systemically or spinally, but not via the intraplantar surface of the formalin-injected paw blocked PNU282987-induced antinociception. Conversely, exogenous administration of the naturally occurring PPAR-α agonist PEA potentiated the antinociceptive effects of PNU282987. In contrast, the cannabinoid CB1 antagonist rimonabant and the CB2 antagonist SR144528 failed to reverse the antinociceptive effects of PNU282987. These findings suggest that PPAR-α plays a key role in a putative antinociceptive α7 nicotinic signaling pathway.",28606623,2017,The interaction between alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α represents a new antinociceptive signaling pathway in mice.

134,"Simultanagnosic patients have difficulty in perceiving multiple objects when presented simultaneously. In this review article, I discuss how neuropsychological research on simultanagnosia has been inspirational for two interconnected lines of research related to the core mechanisms by which the visual system processes cluttered scenes. First, I review previous studies on enumeration tasks indicating that, despite their inability to identify multiple objects, simultanagnosic patients can enumerate up to 2-3 elements as efficiently as healthy individuals (the so-called ""subitizing"" phenomenon). This intriguing observation is one of the first results to support the existence of an ""object individuation"" mechanism that can spatially tag a limited set of objects simultaneously, and resonates with recent research on the brain dynamics of enumeration in healthy individuals. Second, I further develop the implications of the dissociation between object identification and object enumeration in simultanagnosia specifically for the distinction between object identification and individuation. The latter distinction has been the subject of recent neuroimaging research that has provided fine-grained information on the spatial as well as temporal aspects of object individuation and recognition. The lessons learned from neuropsychological research on exact enumeration in simultanagnosia can be generalized to the normal functioning of the human mind, and have provided insightful clues for cognitive neuroscience.",28632043,2017,Simultanagnosia and object individuation.

We then contrasted participants based on history of suicidality by cognitive domains and insight measures and conducted multivariate analyses.


RESULTS
Although a history of any passive ideation was not associated with cognitive ability or insight, verbal learning was positively associated with a greater history of suicidal attempt and prior ideation with a plan and intent. Higher cognitive insight, and the self-reflectiveness subscale insight, was also associated with history of passive or active suicidal ideation. Cognitive insight and cognitive ability were independent from each other, and there were no moderating influences of insight on the effect of cognitive ability on suicide related history. Exploratory analyses revealed that history of planned attempts were associated with greater verbal learning, whereas histories of aborted attempts were associated with poorer reasoning and problem-solving.


IMPLICATIONS
Although cross-sectional and retrospective, this study provides support that greater cognitive ability, specifically verbal learning, along with self-reflectiveness, may confer elevated risk for more severe suicidal ideation and behavior in an independent fashion. Interestingly, poorer problem-solving was associated with aborted suicide attempts.",28655480,2018,Associations of suicidality with cognitive ability and cognitive insight in outpatients with Schizophrenia.
137,"Narcolepsy type 1 is a life-long, severe, multifaceted disease often arising in childhood or adolescence. Beyond the classical symptoms (excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hallucinations, sleep paralysis and nocturnal fragmented sleep), metabolic, endocrinological, psychiatric and psychosocial aspects must be considered. Despite the increased awareness after H1N1 pandemic influenza and vaccination, narcolepsy is still misdiagnosed and unrecognized. The peculiar presentation of symptoms in narcoleptic children could in part explain the misdiagnoses. Excessive daytime sleepiness presenting as chronic drowsiness or irritability could be stigmatized as laziness or misinterpreted as behavior or inattention disorder. The persistent hypotonia and the complex hyperkinetic movements that characterize cataplexy close to the onset, could be misdiagnosed as a movement disorder or as other neurologic conditions. The consequent therapeutic delay could turn into dramatic consequences. The narcolepsy onset, indeed, is associated with abrupt weight gain and sometimes with precocious puberty that require a prompt recognition and treatment to avoid auxological and metabolic complications. Moreover, narcoleptic children could have behavioral and psychiatric disorders ranging from mood to psychotic ones that need ad hoc management. Accordingly, spreading the awareness outside the sleep specialist community is necessary in order to reduce the diagnostic delay and to obtain prompt and multidisciplinary management.",28666745,2018,The clinical spectrum of childhood narcolepsy.
138,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel, is reported to mediate brain damage following ischemic insults in adult mice. However, the role of TRPM2 channels in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury remains unknown. We hypothesize that TRPM2+/- and TRPM2-/- neonatal mice have reduced hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. To study the effect of TRPM2 on neonatal brain damage, we used 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining to assess the infarct volume and whole brain imaging to assess morphological changes in the brain. In addition, we also evaluated neurobehavioral outcomes for sensorimotor function 7days following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We report that the infarct volumes were significantly smaller and behavioral outcomes were improved in both TRPM2+/- and TRPM2-/- mice compared to that of wildtype mice. Next, we found that TRPM2-null mice showed reduced dephosphorylation of GSK-3β following hypoxic ischemic injury unlike sham mice. TRPM2+/- and TRPM2-/- mice also had reduced activation of astrocytes and microglia in ipsilateral hemispheres, compared to wildtype mice. These findings suggest that TRPM2 channels play an essential role in mediating hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal mice. Genetically eliminating TRPM2 channels can provide neuroprotection against hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and this effect is elicited in part through regulation of GSK-3β.",28668375,2017,Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 channels (TRPM2) mediate neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in mice.
139,"BACKGROUND
For patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, shoulder balance influences their treatment satisfaction and psychological well-being. Several parameters are known to affect postoperative shoulder balance, but few prognostic models are as yet available.


PURPOSE
This study aimed to identify independent predictive factors that can be used to assess preoperatively which patients are at risk of postoperative shoulder elevation, and to build a linear prediction model.


METHODS
N = 102 patients with all Lenke types were reviewed radiographically before surgery and 1 year afterward. The outcome measures were coracoid height difference (CHD), clavicular angle (CA), and clavicle-first rib intersection difference (CiRID). Predictive factors commonly used in the literature were investigated using correlation analysis and statistical testing. Significant contributing factors were included in three multiple linear regression models (for CHD, CA, and CiRID).


RESULTS
The mean shoulder level (CHD) significantly changed from a lower left shoulder value of -8.5 mm before surgery to 3.3 mm at the follow-up examination. A high preoperative left shoulder level by CiRID, a large amount of Cobb angle correction of the distal thoracic curve, a low preoperative Cobb angle in the lumbar curve, and a structural proximal thoracic curve proved to be determinants and thus risk factors for left-sided shoulder elevation after surgery. The three models predicting CHD, CA, and CiRID at the follow-up examination included these four risk factors and were significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Preoperative variables have the strongest influence on shoulder level after spinal instrumentation. Additionally, extensive correction of the distal thoracic curve can cause elevation of the left shoulder.",28689293,2018,Predictors of shoulder level after spinal fusion in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

141,"Mastitis is a major disease affecting the herds of dairy farmers worldwide. One of the indicators directly related to the widespread infection of this disease in herds is the bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). Recent studies have shown that one of the risk factors associated with mastitis is the human factor. Therefore, understanding the influence of humans is essential to control and prevent the disease. The main goal of this study was to determine whether the motivations and barriers perceived by farmers could explain the variation in the BTSCC. This study was conducted at 75 dairy farms in southern Brazil. In the interviews with farmers, a survey based on Likert scale items was used to collect data. Structural equation models were used to explain the subjectivity in the ratio of observed variables and latent variables elucidating the possible causal relationships between the variables. The model indicated that some of the variation in the BTSCC can be explained by the farmer's behavior, which is elucidated by his/her motivations and barriers. The correlations between motivations and the BTSCC and between barriers and the BTSCC were positive. These findings suggest that variations in the BTSCC can be explained by the motivations and barriers perceived by farmers and that the Fogg Behavior Model used in this study can be used to explain how human behaviors influence mastitis control. This study also indicates that consulting companies focused on improving milk quality should pay attention to the human factor to reduce these barriers.",28724474,2018,Human behavioral influences and milk quality control programs.
142,"The latent period, a seizure-free phase, is the duration between brain injury and the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) during epileptogenesis. The latent period is thought to involve several progressive pathophysiological events that lead to the evolution of the chronic epilepsy phase. Hence, it is vital to investigate the changes in the latent period during epileptogenesis in order to better understand temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and to achieve early diagnosis and appropriate management of the condition. Accordingly, recent studies with patients with TLE using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have reported that alterations of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) during the chronic period are associated with some clinical manifestations, including learning and memory impairments, emotional instability, and social behavior deficits, in addition to repetitive seizure episodes. In contrast, the changes in the intrinsic rsFC during epileptogenesis, particularly during the latent period, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the alterations in intrinsic rsFC during the latent and chronic periods in a pilocarpine-induced TLE mouse model using intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI). This technique can monitor the changes in the local hemoglobin concentration according to neuronal activity and can help investigate large-scale brain intrinsic networks. After seeding on the anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and calculating the correlation coefficients between each ROI, we established and compared functional correlation matrices and functional connectivity maps during the latent and chronic periods of epilepsy. We found a decrease in the interhemispheric rsFC at the frontal and temporal regions during both the latent and chronic periods. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the interhemispheric rsFC was observed in the somatosensory area during the chronic period. Changes in network configurations during epileptogenesis were examined by graph theoretical network analysis. Interestingly, increase in the power of low frequency oscillations was observed during the latent period. These results suggest that, even if there are no apparent ictal seizure events during the latent period, there are ongoing changes in the rsFC in the epileptic brain. Furthermore, these results suggest that the pathophysiology of epilepsy may be related to widespread altered intrinsic functional connectivity. These findings can help enhance our understanding of epileptogenesis, and accordingly, changes in intrinsic functional connectivity can serve as an early diagnosis.",28729114,2017,Altered intrinsic functional connectivity in the latent period of epileptogenesis in a temporal lobe epilepsy model.
143,"We studied the ontogenetic growth of goat wethers (castrated male goats) of the Saanen and Swiss Alpine breeds based on a large range of intraspecific body mass (BM). The body parts and the chemical constituents of the empty body were described by the allometric function by using BM and the empty body mass (EBM) as the predictors for morphological traits and chemical composition, respectively. We fitted the allometric scaling function by applying the SAS NLMIXED procedure, but to evaluate assumptions regarding variances in morphological and compositional traits, we combined the scaling function with homoscedastic (MOD1), and the heteroscedastic exponential (MOD2) and power-of-the-mean (MOD3) variance functions. We also predicted the ontogenetic growth by using the traditional log-log transformation and back-transformed results into the arithmetic scale (MOD4). We obtained predictions from MOD4 in the arithmetic scale by a two-step process, and evaluated MOD1, MOD2 and MOD3 by a model selection framework, and compared MOD4 with MOD1, MOD2 and MOD3 based on goodness-of-fit measures. Based on information criteria for model selection, heterogeneous variance functions were more likely to describe 10 over 36 traits with a low level of model selection uncertainty. One trait was predicted by averaging the MOD1 and MOD2 variance functions; and nine traits were better described by averaging the MOD2 and MOD3 variance functions. The predictions for other 16 traits were averaged from MOD1, MOD2 and MOD3. However, MOD4 better described 11 traits according to the goodness-of-fit measures. Depending on the variable being analyzed, the body parts and the chemical amounts exhibited the three types of allometric behavior with respect to BM and EBM, that is, positive, negative and isometric ontogenetic growth. Reference BMs, that is, 20, 27, 35 and 45 kg, were used to compute the net protein and energy requirements based on the first derivative of the scaling function, and the results were presented in reference to the EBM and EBM0.75. Both the net protein and energy requirements scaled to EBM0.75 increased from 20 to 45 kg of BM.",28770697,2018,The ontogenetic allometry of body morphology and chemical composition in dairy goat wethers.
144,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate locomotor strategies during development in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus); we were motivated, in part, by current efforts to improve the design of housing systems for laying hens which aim to reduce injury and over-exertion. Using four strains of laying hens (Lohmann Brown, Lohmann LSL lite, Dekalb White and Hyline Brown) throughout this longitudinal study, we investigated their locomotor style and climbing capacity in relation to the degree (0 to 70°) of incline, age (2 to 36 weeks) and the surface substrate (sandpaper or wire grid). Chicks and adult fowl performed only walking behavior to climb inclines ⩽40° and performed a combination of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) or aerial ascent on steeper inclines. Fewer birds used their wings to aid their hind limbs when climbing 50° inclines on wire grid surface compared with sandpaper. The steepness of angle achieved during WAIR and the tendency to fly instead of using WAIR increased with increasing age and experience. White-feathered strains performed more wing-associated locomotor behavior compared with brown-feathered strains. A subset of birds was never able to climb incline angles >40° even when using WAIR. Therefore, we suggest that inclines of up to 40° should be provided for hens in three-dimensional housing systems, which are easily negotiated (without wing use) by chicks and adult fowl.",28780926,2018,Development of locomotion over inclined surfaces in laying hens.
145,"Perturbation of normal behaviors in honey bee colonies by any external factor can immediately reduce the colony's capacity for brood rearing, which can eventually lead to colony collapse. To investigate the effects of brood-rearing suppression on the biology of honey bee workers, gene-set enrichment analysis of the transcriptomes of worker bees with or without suppressed brood rearing was performed. When brood rearing was suppressed, pathways associated with both protein degradation and synthesis were simultaneously over-represented in both nurses and foragers, and their overall pathway representation profiles resembled those of normal foragers and nurses, respectively. Thus, obstruction of normal labor induced over-representation in pathways related with reshaping of worker bee physiology, suggesting that transition of labor is physiologically reversible. In addition, some genes associated with the regulation of neuronal excitability, cellular and nutritional stress and aggressiveness were over-expressed under brood rearing suppression perhaps to manage in-hive stress under unfavorable conditions.",28803879,2018,Pathway profiles based on gene-set enrichment analysis in the honey bee Apis mellifera under brood rearing-suppressed conditions.
146,"Perinatal injections of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist in rodents emulate some cognitive impairments and neurochemical alterations, such as decreased GABAergic (gamma aminobutyric acid) interneuron immunoreactivity, also found in schizophrenia. These features are pervasive, and developing neuroprotective or neurorestorative strategies is of special interest. In this work, we aimed to investigate if a short exposure to enriched environment (EE) in early adulthood (P55-P73) was an effective strategy to improve cognitive dysfunction and to restore interneuron expression in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC). For that purpose, we administered MK-801 intraperitoneally to Long Evans rats from postnatal days 10 to 20. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, MK-801 produced a transient decrease in spontaneous motor activity and exploration, but those abnormalities were absent at P24 and P55. The open field test on P73 manifested that EE reduced anxiety-like behavior. In addition, MK-801-treated rats showed cognitive impairment in novel object recognition test that was reversed by EE. We quantified different interneuron populations based on their calcium-binding protein expression (parvalbumin, calretinin, and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase 67, and neuronal nuclei-positive cells by means of unbiased stereology and found that EE enhanced interneuron immunoreactivity up to normal values in MK-801-treated rats.

148,"Departure from normal circadian rhythmicity and exposure to atypical lighting cues has been shown to adversely affect human health and wellness in a variety of ways. In contrast, adaptation to extreme environments has led many species to alter or even entirely abandon their reliance upon cyclic environmental inputs, principally daily cycles of light and darkness. The extreme darkness, stability and isolation of cave ecosystems has made cave-adapted species particularly attractive systems in which to study the consequences of life without light and the strategies that allow species to survive and even thrive in such environments. In order to further explore these questions, we have assessed the rhythmicity of locomotion in the blind Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, under controlled laboratory conditions. Using high-resolution video tracking assays, we characterized patterns in locomotor activity and spatial tank usage for members of the surface and Pachón cave populations. Here we demonstrate that cavefish have a higher overall level of activity and use the space within the trial tank differently than surface fish. Further, Pachón cavefish show circadian rhythmicity in both activity and spatial tank usage under a 12:12 light/dark cycle. We provide further evidence that these cavefish retain a weakly light-entrainable, endogenous circadian oscillator with limited capability to sustain rhythms in activity, but not spatial tank usage, in the absence of photic cues. Finally, we demonstrate a putative behavioral ""masking effect"" contributing to behavioral rhythms and provide evidence that exposure to constant darkness during development may alter behavioral patterns later in life.",28823830,2017,"Characterization and comparison of activity profiles exhibited by the cave and surface morphotypes of the blind Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus."

Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) has been associated with offspring internalizing and externalizing disorders. The purpose of this research is to examine whether MSDP is also associated with variations in normal personality traits in childhood and adulthood.


METHOD
This study uses four independent samples (total N = 16,323) to examine whether there are mean-level differences in offspring personality traits by MSDP, controlling for relevant sociodemographic factors. Two samples are of children (Ns = 3,782 and 3,841) and two samples are of adults (Ns = 1,786 and 6,914).


RESULTS
A meta-analysis across the four samples indicated that offspring of mothers who did smoke during pregnancy scored higher in Neuroticism (p = .000) and Extraversion (p = .003) and lower in Conscientiousness (p = .002) than offspring of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. The association between MSDP and Neuroticism and Conscientiousness held across both childhood and adulthood and when propensity score matching was used, whereas the association with Extraversion was only apparent in adulthood and did not hold with propensity scores.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that MSDP is associated with individual differences in psychological traits in childhood and adulthood and may be one prenatal factor that contributes to trait Neuroticism and Conscientiousness.",28833118,2017,Maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring personality in childhood and adulthood.
150,"The neurovascular unit (NVU) can be conceptualized as a functional entity consisting of neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells that operate in concert to affect blood flow to a very circumscribed area. Although we are currently in a ""golden era"" of bioengineering, there are, as yet, no living NVUs-on-a-chip modules available and the development of a neural chip that would mimic NVUs is a seemingly lofty goal. The sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) is a tiny brain structure (between 0.001~0.007 mm3 in rats) with an assessable biological function (i.e., male sexual behavior). The present effort was undertaken to determine whether there are identifiable NVUs in the SDN-POA by assessing its vasculature relative to its known neural components. First, a thorough and systematic review of thousands of histologic and immunofluorescent images from 201 weanling and adult rats was undertaken to define the characteristics of the vessels supplying the SDN-POA: its primary supply artery/arteriole and capillaries are physically inseparable from their neural elements. A subsequent immunofluorescent study targeting α-smooth muscle actin confirmed the identity of an artery/arteriole supplying the SDN-POA. In reality, the predominant components of the SDN-POA are calbindin D28k-positive neurons that are comingled with tyrosine hydroxylase-positive projections. Finally, a schematic of an SDN-POA NVU is proposed as a working model of the basic building block of the CNS. Such modules could serve the study of neurovascular mechanisms and potentially inform the development of next generation bioengineered neural transplants, i.e., the construct of an NVU neural chip.",28840477,2018,A Working Module for the Neurovascular Unit in the Sexually Dimorphic Nucleus of the Preoptic Area.

Administration of TiO2-nanowired cerebrolysin (CBL) could represent an additional strategy to protect or repair the nigrostriatal system. This study aims to explore morphofunctional and biochemical changes in a preclinical stage of PD testing the synergistic efficiency of combining both strategies, housing in EE, and nanodelivery of CBL. Sprague-Dawley male rats receiving intrastriatally 6-hydroxydopamine after a short evolution time were segregated into CBL group (rats receiving nanowired CBL), EE group (rats housed in EE), CBL + EE group (rats housed in EE and receiving nanowired CBL), and control group (rats without additional treatment). Prodromic stage and treatment effects were characterized by the presence of motor symptoms (amphetamine-induced rotational behavior test). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry and Western blot (p-Akt/Akt and p-ERK/ERK 1/2 as survival markers and caspase-3 as apoptotic marker) were performed in striatum and SN. A decrease in motor symptoms was shown by rats receiving CBL. EE monitoring cages revealed that rats from CBL + EE group showed more significant number of laps in the wheel than EE group. In SN, CBL + EE group also presented the highest neuronal density. Moreover, p-Akt/Akt and p-ERK/ERK 1/2 ratio was significant higher and caspase-3 expression was lower in CBL + EE group. In conclusion, the combination of CBL and EE provided evidence of neuoprotective-neurorestorative mechanisms by which this combined strategy promoted morphofunctional improvement by activation of survival pathways after dopamine depletion in a preclinical model of PD.",28840482,2018,Nanodelivery of Cerebrolysin and Rearing in Enriched Environment Induce Neuroprotective Effects in a Preclinical Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.
152,"Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are a promising therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease (PD). They exert their function through tyrosine kinase receptors. Our goal was to assess the effects of administering a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (vandetanib) that blocks VEGFR2 and RET receptors in a preclinical model of PD. Rats underwent intrastriatal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Two weeks later, the rats received 30 mg/kg vandetanib or saline orally. The effects were assessed using the rotational behavioral test, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, and western blot. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, motor symptoms were almost undetectable, but morphological and biochemical changes were significant. Vandetanib treatment, combined with the presence of 6-OHDA lesions, significantly increased behavioral impairment and morphological and biochemical changes. Therefore, after vandetanib treatment, the TH-immunopositive striatal volume, the percentage of TH+ neurons, and the extent of the axodendritic network in the substantia nigra decreased. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positivity significantly decreased in the striatum and substantia nigra in the vandetanib-treated group. In addition, p-Akt and p-ERK 1/2 levels were significantly lower and caspase-3 expression significantly increased after vandetanib administration. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time the deleterious effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor on the dopaminergic system, supporting the beneficial and synergistic effect of NTFs reported in previous papers.",28840516,2018,Deleterious Effects of VEGFR2 and RET Inhibition in a Preclinical Model of Parkinson's Disease.
153,"BACKGROUND
Learning transfer is defined as an individual's capability to apply prior learnt perceptual, motor, or conceptual skills to a novel task or performance environment. In the sport sciences, learning transfers have been investigated from an athlete-specific perspective. However, sport scientists should also consider the benefits of cross-disciplinary learning to aid critical thinking and metacognitive skill gained through the interaction with similar quantitative scientific disciplines.


OBJECTIVE
Using team sports performance analysis as an example, this study aimed to demonstrate the utility of a common analytical technique in ecology in the sports sciences, namely, nonmetric multidimensional scaling.


METHODS
To achieve this aim, three novel research examples using this technique are presented, each of which enables the analysis and visualization of athlete (organism), team (aggregation of organisms), and competition (ecosystem) behaviors.


RESULTS
The first example reveals the technical behaviors of Australian Football League Brownlow medalists from the 2001 to 2016 seasons. The second example delineates dissimilarity in higher and lower ranked National Rugby League teams within the 2016 season. Lastly, the third example shows the evolution of game play in the basketball tournaments between the 2004 and 2016 Olympic Games.


CONCLUSIONS
In addition to the novel findings of each example, the collective results demonstrate that, by embracing cross-disciplinary learning and drawing upon an analytical technique common to ecology, novel solutions to pertinent research questions within sports performance analysis could be addressed in a practically meaningful way. Cross-disciplinary learning may subsequently assist sport scientists in the analysis and visualization of multivariate datasets.",28840544,2018,Transferring an Analytical Technique from Ecology to the Sport Sciences.
154,"Approximately, 1.7 million Americans suffer a TBI annually and TBI is a major cause of death and disability. The majority of the TBI cases are of the mild type and while most patients recover completely from mild TBI (mTBI) about 10% result in persistent symptoms and some result in lifelong disability. Anxiety disorders are the second most common diagnosis post-TBI. Of note, TBI-induced anxiety disorders are difficult to treat and remain a chronic condition suggesting that new therapies are needed. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a mild TBI induced an anxiety-like phenotype, a key feature of the human condition, associated with loss of GABAergic interneurons and hyperexcitability in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in rodents 7 and 30 days after a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. We now confirm that animals display significantly increased anxiety-like behavior 30 days after CCI. The anxiety-like behavior was associated with a significant loss of GABAergic interneurons and significant reductions in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous and miniature GABAA-receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in the BLA. Significantly, subchronic treatment with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) after CCI prevents the development of anxiety-like behavior, the loss of GABAergic interneurons, hyperexcitability in the BLA and reduces the impact injury. Taken together, administration of ALA after CCI is a potent therapy against the neuropathology and pathophysiological effects of mTBI in the BLA.",28844093,2018,Alpha-Linolenic Acid Treatment Reduces the Contusion and Prevents the Development of Anxiety-Like Behavior Induced by a Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Rats.

While studies have explored the benefits of infant touch in terms of physical health and growth, the effects of social touch on infant behavior are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated the influence of neonatal handling on a variety of domains, including memory, novelty seeking, and social interest, in infant monkeys (Macaca mulatta; n=48) from 2 to 12 weeks of age. Neonates were randomly assigned to receive extra holding, with or without accompanying face-to-face interactions. Extra-handled infants, compared to standard-reared infants, exhibited less stress-related behavior and more locomotion around a novel environment, faster approach of novel objects, better working memory, and less fear towards a novel social partner. In sum, infants who received more tactile stimulation in the neonatal period subsequently demonstrated more advanced motor, social, and cognitive skills-particularly in contexts involving exploration of novelty-in the first three months of life. These data suggest that social touch may support behavioral development, offering promising possibilities for designing future early interventions, particularly for infants who are at heightened risk for social disorders.",28844729,2017,"Handling newborn monkeys alters later exploratory, cognitive, and social behaviors."

A significant decrease in dopamine (DA) and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) along with a marked decrease in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum (STr) confirms the validity of this model for studying PD. Since cerebrolysin (CBL) is a well-balanced composition of several neurotrophic factors and active peptide fragments, in the present investigation we examined the timed release of CBL using titanate nanospheres (TiNS) in treating PD in our mouse model. Our observations show that TiNS-CBL (in a dose of 3 ml/kg, i.v.) given after 2 days of MPTP administration for 5 days resulted in a marked increase in TH-positive cells in the SNpc and STr as compared to normal CBL. Also, TiNS-CBL resulted in significantly higher levels of DA, DOPAC, and HVA in SNpc and STr on the 8th day as compared to normal CBL therapy. TiNS-CBL also thwarted increased α-synuclein levels in the brain and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the in PD brain as compared to untreated group. Behavioral function was also significantly improved in MPTP-treated animals that received TiNS-CBL. These observations are the first to demonstrate that timed release of TiNS-CBL has far more superior neuroprotective effects in PD than normal CBL.",28875428,2018,Timed Release of Cerebrolysin Using Drug-Loaded Titanate Nanospheres Reduces Brain Pathology and Improves Behavioral Functions in Parkinson's Disease.
157,"The heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme heparanase promotes the progression of many cancers by driving tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Heparanase accomplishes this via multiple mechanisms including its recently described effect on enhancing biogenesis of tumor exosomes. Because we recently discovered that heparanase expression is upregulated in myeloma cells that survive chemotherapy, we were prompted to investigate the impact of anti-myeloma drugs on exosome biogenesis. When myeloma cells were exposed to the commonly utilized anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib or melphalan, exosome secretion by the cells was dramatically enhanced. These chemotherapy-induced exosomes (chemoexosomes) have a proteome profile distinct from cells not exposed to drug including a dramatic elevation in the level of heparanase present as exosome cargo. The chemoexosome heparanase was not found inside the chemoexosome, but was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an extracellular matrix. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their heparan sulfate degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-α, an important myeloma growth factor. Moreover, chemoexosomes stimulated macrophage migration and this effect was blocked by H1023, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. These data suggest that anti-myeloma therapy ignites a burst of exosomes having a high level of heparanase that remodels extracellular matrix and alters tumor and host cell behaviors that likely contribute to chemoresistance and eventual patient relapse.


SUMMARY
We find that anti-myeloma chemotherapy dramatically stimulates secretion of exosomes and alters exosome composition. Exosomes secreted during therapy contain high levels of heparanase on their surface that can degrade ECM and also can be transferred to both tumor and host cells, altering their behavior in ways that may enhance tumor survival and progression.",28888912,2018,Chemotherapy induces secretion of exosomes loaded with heparanase that degrades extracellular matrix and impacts tumor and host cell behavior.
158,"OBJECTIVE
To review the evidence to determine the effects of psychological interventions on self-care and psychological and health outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).


METHODS
We evaluated the effectiveness of randomized controlled trials using psychological methods or theory on self-care behaviors, anxiety and depression levels, HRQoL, and physical function. Studies published in English, from January 2006 to December 2016, were considered. We searched published and unpublished studies in the following electronic databases: CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Risk of bias was assessed using a standard procedure based on the Cochrane Collaboration tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.


RESULTS
A total of 29 articles, consisting of 25 studies with 3837 participants, were included in this systematic review. Findings showed that despite heterogeneity between studies, psychological interventions tend to improve self-care in CHF patients without clinical depression and cognitive impairment. Pooled results also revealed that the intervention effect on short-term HRQoL, as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), was in favor of the intervention group (combined MD -7.53, 95% CI -12.83 to -2.23); however, such effect disappeared as the length of time from the intervention increased. The intervention effects on the participants' anxiety level, as measured by HADS, and physical function, as measured by 6MWT, were not statistically significant.


DISCUSSION
Efforts aimed at promoting self-care were the cornerstone of HF disease management. Nurses play an important role in patient education and secondary prevention. Compared to other professionals, nurses have more patient contact opportunities and are more holistic in all aspects of disease management; therefore, more nurses can be trained to incorporate the brief psychological techniques (such as motivational interviews and cognitive behavior therapy) to maximize intervention effectiveness. The main limitation of the review is the moderate to high level of heterogeneity among the included studies, which may partially undermine the reliability and reproducibility of the results. Because of the heterogeneity among the studies, a conclusion on the optimal format and forms of the intervention could not be drawn. Replication of the studies will be required in the future to isolate the active intervention component and to identify the ideal intervention format and dosage.",28935393,2017,"The effectiveness of psychological interventions on self-care, psychological and health outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure-A systematic review and meta-analysis."
159,"BackgroundLow-birth-weight infants (LBW) are at an increased risk of iron deficiency that has been associated with impaired neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that iron supplementation of LBW infants improves cognitive scores and reduces behavioral problems until school age.MethodsWe randomized 285 marginally LBW (2,000-2,500 g) infants to receive 0, 1, or 2 mg/kg/day of iron supplements from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. At 7 years of age, 205 participants were assessed regarding cognition using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) and behavior using the parental questionnaires Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Five to Fifteen (FTF).ResultsThere were no significant differences between the intervention groups in WISC-IV or FTF. However, the CBCL scores for externalizing problems were significantly different, in favor of supplemented children (P=0.045). When combining the supplemented groups, they had significantly lower scores for externalizing behavior compared with placebo (median (interquartile range): 44 [34;51] vs. 48.5 [41;56] P=0.013), and their risk ratio (95% confidence interval) for a total behavioral score above the cutoff for clinical problems was 0.31 (0.09-1.0), P=0.054.ConclusionLower scores of externalizing behavior in supplemented children support our previous findings at 3 years, and suggest that iron supplementation may have long-lasting effects on behavioral functions.",28953856,2018,Effects of iron supplementation of low-birth-weight infants on cognition and behavior at 7 years: a randomized controlled trial.
160,"Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) in combination with gas-phase hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) is evaluated as an analytical method for small-molecule standard and mixture characterization. Experiments show that compound ions exhibit unique HDX reactivities that can be used to distinguish different species. Additionally, it is shown that gas-phase HDX kinetics can be exploited to provide even further distinguishing capabilities by using different partial pressures of reagent gas. The relative HDX reactivity of a wide variety of molecules is discussed in light of the various molecular structures. Additionally, hydrogen accessibility scoring (HAS) and HDX kinetics modeling of candidate (in silico) ion structures is utilized to estimate the relative ion conformer populations giving rise to specific HDX behavior. These data interpretation methods are discussed with a focus on developing predictive tools for HDX behavior. Finally, an example is provided in which ion mobility information is supplemented with HDX reactivity data to aid identification efforts of compounds in a metabolite extract.

161,"The embodied mammalian brain evolved to adapt to an only partially known and knowable world. The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala, plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the switching between modes of attention and learning.",28965244,2018,Cholinergic Behavior State-Dependent Mechanisms of Neocortical Gain Control: a Neurocomputational Study.
162,"Most high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements are aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Occasional double-hit follicular lymphomas have been described but the clinicopathological features of these tumors are not well known. To clarify the characteristics of double-hit follicular lymphomas, we analyzed 10 cases of double-hit follicular lymphomas and 15 cases of high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements for clinicopathological and genome-wide copy-number alterations and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity profiles. For double-hit follicular lymphomas, the median age was 67.5 years (range: 48-82 years). The female/male ratio was 2.3. Eight patients presented with advanced clinical stage. The median follow-up time was 20 months (range: 1-132 months). At the end of the follow-up, 8 patients were alive, 2 patients were dead including 1 patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformation. Rearrangements of MYC/BCL2, MYC/BCL6, and MYC/BCL2/BCL6 were seen in 8, 1, and 1 cases, respectively. The partner of MYC was IGH in 6 cases. There were no cases of histological grade 1, 4 cases of grade 2, 5 cases of grade 3a, and 1 case of grade 3b. Two cases of grade 3a exhibited immunoblast-like morphology. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated 9 cases with ≥50% MYC-positive cells. There was significant difference in MYC intensity (P=0.00004) and MIB-1 positivity (P=0.001) between double-hit follicular lymphomas and high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. The genome profile of double-hit follicular lymphomas was comparable with conventional follicular lymphomas (GSE67385, n=198) with characteristic gains of 2p25.3-p11.1, 7p22.3-q36.3, 12q11-q24.33, and loss of 18q21.32-q23 (P<0.05). In comparison with high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, double-hit follicular lymphomas had fewer copy-number alterations and minimal common region of gain at 2p16.1 (70%), locus also significant against conventional follicular lymphomas (P=0.0001). In summary, double-hit follicular lymphomas tended to be high-grade histology, high MYC protein expression, high MYC/IGH fusion, and minimal common region of gain at 2p16.1. Double-hit follicular lymphomas seemed to be a different disease from high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements and have an indolent clinical behavior similar to follicular lymphomas without MYC rearrangement.",28984304,2018,Clinicopathological and genomic analysis of double-hit follicular lymphoma: comparison with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements.
163,"The biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) and the bloc-one-related complex (BORC) are the cytosolic protein complexes required for specialized membrane protein traffic along the endocytic route and the spatial distribution of endosome-derived compartments, respectively. BLOC-1 and BORC complex subunits and components of their interactomes have been associated with the risk and/or pathomechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, cellular processes requiring BLOC-1 and BORC interactomes have the potential to offer novel insight into mechanisms underlying behavioral defects. We focus on interactions between BLOC-1 or BORC subunits with the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, membrane tethers, and SNAREs. These interactions highlight requirements for BLOC-1 and BORC in membrane movement by motors, control of actin polymerization, and targeting of membrane proteins to specialized cellular domains such as the nerve terminal and the primary cilium.

164,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms such as rigidity, rest tremor, and bradykinesia. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrated that PD encompasses several non-motor disturbances as well, such as cognitive impairment. Cognitive defects can be present since early stages of the disease but tend to dominate the clinical picture as the disease progresses. Around 40% of patients with PD present with cognitive impairments in several cognitive domains including attention, working memory and executive functions, language, visuospatial skills, and episodic memory; in later stages of the disease, cognitive defects and associated behavioral disorders concur to determine clinically relevant PD-associated dementia. Part of these defects is ascribed to a dopamine-dependent dysfunction of fronto-striatal pathways, but there is a considerable heterogeneity in the cognitive impairments as well as a suggestion of the role of other neurotransmitter systems, such as the cholinergic one, mainly responsible for Parkinson-dementia syndrome. In this paper, we review recent literature with particular attention to the last 5 years on the main cognitive deficits described in PD patients as well as on the hypothesized neuro-functional substrate of such impairments. Finally, we provide some suggestions on how to test cognitive functions in PD appropriately.",29043468,2018,Cognitive and behavioral disorders in Parkinson's disease: an update.

165,"Primary mitochondrial diseases (MD) are complex, heterogeneous inherited diseases caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. Glomerular diseases in MD have been reported with tRNA mutation m.3243A>G causing a syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We describe here a case of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with a new tRNA mutation site. A 34-year-old man with a history of living related kidney transplantation, diabetes, hearing loss, and developmental delay presented to the outpatient clinic with complaints of new behavioral difficulties, worsening symptoms, and brain involvement on imaging. Physical examination was remarkable for difficulty hearing, a pattern of dysarthric speech, and cerebellar gait. Laboratory investigations including lactate levels were unremarkable. Based on this set of clinical circumstances, concern for an underlying genetic abnormality was raised. Multiple metabolic tests were unremarkable. Whole exome sequencing revealed a mitochondrial MT-TW tRNA change at position m.5538G>A. Genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with this tRNA mutation as a cause of his symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case describing FSGS-associated MD caused by an m.5538 G>A mutation.

166,"Male sex hormones-androgens-regulate male physique development. Without androgen signaling, genetic males appear female. During puberty, increasing androgens harness the hair follicle's unique regenerative ability to replace many tiny vellus hairs with larger, darker terminal hairs ( e.g., beard). Follicle response is epigenetically varied: some remain unaffected ( e.g., eyelashes) or are inhibited, causing balding. How sex steroid hormones alter such developmental processes is unclear, despite high incidences of hormone-driven cancer, hirsutism, and alopecia. Unfortunately, existing development models are not androgen sensitive. Here, we use hair follicles to establish an androgen-responsive human organ culture model. We show that women's intermediate facial follicles respond to men's higher androgen levels by synthesizing more hair over several days, unlike donor-matched, androgen-insensitive, terminal follicles. We demonstrate that androgen receptors-androgen-activated gene transcription regulators-are required and are present in vivo within these follicles. This is the first human organ that involves multiple cell types that responds appropriately to hormones in prolonged culture, in a way which mirrors its natural behavior. Thus, intermediate hair follicles offer a hormone-switchable human model with exceptional, unique availability of genetically identical, but epigenetically hormone-insensitive, terminal follicles. This should enable advances in understanding sex steroid hormone signaling, gene regulation, and developmental and regenerative systems and facilitate better therapies for hormone-dependent disorders.-Miranda, B.

167,"INTRODUCTION
Surgery in children can be difficult for patients and parents. We aimed to summarize pediatric patients' and parents' psychosocial experiences and needs in surgery.


METHOD
We used the Ovid search engine and screened 877 abstracts across three databases to extract data on pediatric patients' and parents' surgical experiences.


RESULTS
Our search yielded 11 eligible studies representing 1,307 children undergoing surgery and their parents. Children's adverse experiences included psychological and behavioral changes before, during, and after surgery (e.g., anxiety, eating disturbances). Parents commonly experienced psychological distress. Children's needs related to medical and health care services, whereas parents had high information needs.


DISCUSSION
Children's adverse experiences can negatively affect medical outcomes. Children's experiences are inextricably linked to their parents' and can become negatively affected by their parents' adverse experiences. Patients and parents with previous hospitalizations and surgeries had worse surgical experiences, highlighting further research in the context of chronic illness.",29066150,2018,The Psychosocial Experiences and Needs of Children Undergoing Surgery and Their Parents: A Systematic Review.

The current study tests a model of inference based on familiarity differences that encompasses the recognition heuristic (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 1999, Goldstein & Gigerenzer in Psychological Review, 109(1), 75-90, 2002). In two studies, using a large pool of stimuli, participants rated their familiarity of cities and made choices on a typical city-size task. The data were fitted with the r-s model (Hilbig, Erdfelder, & Pohl in, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, 37(4), 827-839, 2011), which was adapted to include familiarity differences. The results indicated that people used the familiarity difference cue because the participants ignored further knowledge in a substantial number of cases when the familiarity difference cue was available. An analysis of reaction-time data further indicated that the response times were shorter for heuristic judgments than for knowledge-only-based judgments. Furthermore, when knowledge was available, the response times were shorter when knowledge was congruent with a heuristic cue than when it was in conflict with it. Differences between the familiarity difference cue and the fluency heuristic (Schooler & Hertwig, 2005, Psychological Review, 112, 610-628) are discussed.",29067637,2018,Use of the familiarity difference cue in inferential judgments.

170,"Objectives The United States is one of only three countries worldwide with no national policy guaranteeing paid leave to employed women who give birth. While maternity leave has been linked to improved maternal and child outcomes in international contexts, up-to-date research evidence in the U.S. context is needed to inform current policy debates on paid family leave. Methods Using data from Listening to Mothers III, a national survey of women ages 18-45 who gave birth in 2011-2012, we conducted multivariate logistic regression to predict the likelihood of outcomes related to infant health, maternal physical and mental health, and maternal health behaviors by the use and duration of paid maternity leave. Results Use of paid and unpaid leave varied significantly by race/ethnicity and household income. Women who took paid maternity leave experienced a 47% decrease in the odds of re-hospitalizing their infants (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) and a 51% decrease in the odds of being re-hospitalized themselves (95% CI 0.3, 0.9) at 21 months postpartum, compared to women taking unpaid or no leave. They also had 1.8 times the odds of doing well with exercise (95% CI 1.1, 3.0) and stress management (95% CI 1.1, 2.8), compared to women taking only unpaid leave. Conclusions for Practice Paid maternity leave significantly predicts lower odds of maternal and infant re-hospitalization and higher odds of doing well with exercise and stress management. Policies aimed at expanding access to paid maternity and family leave may contribute toward reducing socio-demographic disparities in paid leave use and its associated health benefits.",29098488,2018,Paid Maternity Leave in the United States: Associations with Maternal and Infant Health.

172,"Learning and memory rely on the adaptation of synaptic connections. Research on the neurophysiology of Down syndrome has characterized an atypical pattern of synaptic plasticity with limited long-term potentiation (LTP) and increased long-term depression (LTD). Here we present a neurocomputational model that instantiates this LTP/LTD imbalance to explore its impact on tasks of associative learning. In Study 1, we ran a series of computational simulations to analyze the learning of simple and overlapping stimulus associations in a model of Down syndrome compared with a model of typical development. Learning in the Down syndrome model was slower and more susceptible to interference effects. We found that interference effects could be overcome with dedicated stimulation schedules. In Study 2, we ran a second set of simulations and an empirical study with participants with Down syndrome and typically developing children to test the predictions of our model. The model adequately predicted the performance of the human participants in a serial reaction time task, an implicit learning task that relies on associative learning mechanisms. Critically, typical and atypical behavior was explained by the interactions between neural plasticity constraints and the stimulation schedule. Our model provides a mechanistic account of learning impairments based on these interactions, and a causal link between atypical synaptic plasticity and associative learning.",29102805,2018,From altered synaptic plasticity to atypical learning: A computational model of Down syndrome.

Herein, the results of periodic DFT calculations based on accurate structural models of alkali-metal-exchanged zeolites are presented, revealing the fundamental roles that confinement and the nature of the exchangeable cations in zeolite micropores have in the performance of faujasite-based catalysts in the DACD reaction. Special attention is devoted to analyzing the effect of functional substituents on furanic substrates (furan, 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid) on the catalyst behavior. It is demonstrated that the conventional reactivity theories of the Diels-Alder chemistry based on simplistic single-site Lewis acidity and substituent effects do not apply if catalytic processes in the multiple-site confined environment of zeolite nanopores are considered.

174,"PURPOSE
Cerebrospinal fluid diversion via ventricular shunt is a common treatment for hydrocephalus. Change in cranial morphology associated with a sutural fusion has been termed shunt-related or induced craniosynostosis (SRC) or craniocerebral disproportion (CCD). We present a series of patients with SRC who underwent cranial vault remodeling (CVR) and our treatment algorithm.


METHODS
Thirteen patients were retrospectively reviewed who had SRC and CVR; 92% of patients had a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placed for largely intraventricular hemorrhage of prematurity (69% of patients) at a mean age of 2.2 months. The shunt revision rate was 38.4%, and 54% of patients had a programmable shunt placed initially.


RESULTS
The mean age at time of CVR was 3.6 years old. The most commonly affected sutures (CT confirmed) were the sagittal and coronal sutures, with three patients exhibiting pancraniosynostosis. The mean time from placement of the shunt to CT evidence of sutural fusion was 2.0 years. Abnormal head shape was noted in all 13 patients; 11 of these also had either chronic headaches, papilledema, seizures, or behavioral changes in the setting of functional shunt. Mean follow-up after the initial CVR was 3.3 years. No shunt infections were attributed to the CVR. The families of all patients were contacted and reported improvement in head shape with 60% of families reporting improvement in behavior, 75% reported improvement in headaches, and 40% reported decrease in seizure frequency or intensity. Shunt setting or type was not routinely changed after CVR.


CONCLUSIONS
Our threshold for CVR in SRC is met when shunt malfunction has been ruled out and there are (1) radiographic evidence of craniosynostosis, (2) signs of increased ICP clinically or radiographically, and (3) cranial dysmorphism, i.e., dolichocephaly. The majority of cases of SRC result in improved cranial morphology in addition to some abatement of the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Early involvement of an experienced craniofacial/neurosurgical team could allow for early diagnosis and intervention which may prevent progression to more severe deformities. SRC is a complex entity, with multiple etiologies, and a future study is needed.",29110198,2018,Surgical management of craniosynostosis in the setting of a ventricular shunt: a case series and treatment algorithm.

Although psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) are hallucinogens, they have different receptor mechanisms of action and have not been directly compared.


OBJECTIVE
This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects.


METHODS
Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration.


RESULTS
High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance.

of final-year dental students were surveyed using the Hiroshima University Dental Behavior Inventory
(HU-DBI) questionnaire and had their plaque indices determined. Descriptive statistics analysis,
nonparametric tests, and correlation analysis were performed (p<0.05). Sixth-year students had a 
significantly better mean HU-DBI score (8.06) than first-year students (6.45). Significantly more first-year
students thought that they could not help having false teeth at their old age (p=0.007), had never
been taught professionally how to brush (p=0.019), and used a toothbrush with hard bristles (p=0.001).
Significantly more final-year students brushed each of their teeth carefully (p=0.008), thought they
could clean their teeth well without using tooth paste (p=0.000), used a dye to see how clean their
teeth were (p=0.002), and had their dentist telling them they brushed very well (p=0.028). Plaque
index values were significantly lower (p<0.05) among first-year (7.94±0.72) than among final-year

180,"The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the fixation distance in real three-dimensional space affects manual reaction time to peripheral visual stimuli. Light-emitting diodes were used for presenting a fixation point and four peripheral visual stimuli. The visual stimuli were located at a distance of 45cm and at 25° in the left, right, upper, and lower directions from the sagittal axis including the fixation point. Near (30cm), Middle (45cm), Far (90cm), and Very Far (300cm) fixation distance conditions were used. When one of the four visual stimuli was randomly illuminated, the participants released a button as quickly as possible. Results showed that overall peripheral reaction time decreased as the fixation distance increased. The significant interaction between fixation distance and stimulus location indicated that the effect of fixation distance on reaction time was observed at the left, right, and upper locations but not at the lower location. These results suggest that fixating at far distance would contribute to faster reaction and that the effect is specific to locations in the peripheral visual field. The present findings are discussed in terms of viewer-centered representation, the focus of attention in depth, and visual field asymmetry related to neurological and psychological aspects.",29126774,2018,Fixating at far distance shortens reaction time to peripheral visual stimuli at specific locations.

Moreover, we evaluated the effects of lithium on anxiety-like behavior and acetylcholinesterase activity in adult zebrafish. We demonstrated that lithium prevents the memory impairment induced by scopolamine, decreases exploration and increases the activity of acetylcholinesterase in zebrafish. Collectively, this contributes to a better understanding of the pharmacology of lithium, its interaction with cholinergic neurotransmission, and its possible application to therapeutic treatments aimed at improving cognition.",29126775,2018,Lithium prevents scopolamine-induced memory impairment in zebrafish.
182,"OBJECTIVES
In the previous studies, it has been demonstrated that acupuncture treatment was effective on the suppression of withdrawal signs as well as self-administration behavior induced by morphine. Based on, the present study has investigated whether acupuncture could attenuate the anxiety-like behavior induced by withdrawal from chronic morphine treatment.


MATERIALS & METHODS
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 270-300g were treated saline or morphine hydrochloride (10mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 weeks. Following abstinence of 5days in home cage, rats were subjected to the measurement of anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Bicuculline (1mg/kg, i.p.) and SCH 50911 (2mg/kg, i.p.) were used to investigate the possible mechanism of acupuncture effects focusing on the GABA receptors system.


RESULTS
Acupuncture at HT7 increased the time spent in open arms significantly. Also, these effects of acupuncture at HT7 were blocked by GABAA receptor antagonist.


CONCLUSION
Results of the present study suggest that acupuncture at HT7 can attenuate anxiety-like behavior induced by withdrawal from chronic morphine treatment through the mediation of GABAA receptor system.",29126776,2018,Effects of acupuncture on the anxiety-like behavior induced by withdrawal from chronic morphine use.
183,"Liver X receptors (LXR) are important transcription factors involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Recently, we described LXR receptors expression in the hypothalamus but their function in this brain area remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the function of LXR on the expression of factors produced in the hypothalamus in vitro and in vivo by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. More precisely we studied the expression of GnRH and GHRH, αMSH and NPY in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effects of two synthetic LXR agonists, T0901317 and GW3965, were first tested in vitro. Hypothalamic explants were treated with either T0901317 or GW3965 (10μM) for 2, 4, 6 and 8h. As a positive control the cholesterol ABCA1 and glucose GLUT2 transporters were used. No changes were observed in the expression of the factors evaluated in vitro. The effects of the LXR agonists were then tested in vivo. Rats were injected ICV into the third ventricle with either T0901317 or GW3965 (2.5μg/5μL ICV) and after 3.5h or 24h the hypothalami were dissected out and rapidly frozen for analysis. αMSH and GnRH expression was significantly increased after 3.5h of T0901317 treatment. Anterior/posterior hypothalamic ratio increases for αMSH expression and decreases for GnRH expression after 24h of LXR activation. Altogether these results show that LXR activation affects the expression of GnRH and αMSH, suggesting that LXR in the hypothalamus is capable of modulating hypothalamic responses related to appetite, sexual behavior and reproductive functions.",29128625,2018,LXR activation increases the expression of GnRH AND αMSH in the rat hypothalamus in vivo.

To solve this problem, zidovudine loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/stearic acid (SA)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanoparticles (PSNPs) were developed.The hybrid nanoparticles were prepared by emulsification-solvent evaporation method. The physico chemical characterizations of the PSNPs was done by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR). The in vitro release behavior and haemocompatibility studies were also performed. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake studies of the PSNPs were assessed in murine neuro-2a and HeLa cells. Our results revealed that the core shell PSNPs prepared from lipid and polymer led to significant improvement in cellular internalization.

185,"Sensitivity to cooling temperatures often becomes heightened in orofacial regions leading to orofacial cold allodynia/hyperalgesia after chronic trigeminal nerve injury. KCNQ2 channels are involved in controlling excitability of primary afferent neurons and thereby regulate sensory functions under both physiological and pathological conditions. In the present study, we sought to determine whether KCNQ2 channels in trigeminal nerves are involved in regulating orofacial operant behavioral responses to cooling stimulation. We also sought to examine whether chronic trigeminal nerve injury may alter KCNQ2 channel expression in trigeminal ganglions. Using the orofacial operant tests, animals show cold allodynia/hyperalgesia in orofacial regions following infraorbital nerve chronic constrictive injury (ION-CCI), which could be alleviated by subcutaneous administration of retigabine, a KCNQ2 activator. In contrast, subcutaneous administration of the KCNQ2 inhibitor XE991 directly elicits cold allodynia/hyperalgesia in sham animals. Using immunostaining, we show that KCNQ2 channels are primarily expressed in small-sized TG neurons. Interestingly, KCNQ2 channel expression becomes significantly upregulated in TG neurons following the ION-CCI. Our results suggest that KCNQ2 channels are involved in regulating orofacial cold sensitivity. Upregulation of KCNQ2 channels may be a compensatory change in attempting to limit injury-induced trigeminal hyperexcitability.",29133175,2018,Role of KCNQ2 channels in orofacial cold sensitivity: KCNQ2 upregulation in trigeminal ganglion neurons after infraorbital nerve chronic constrictive injury.
186,"PURPOSE
To study how rod- and cone-driven responses depend on stimulus size in normal subjects and patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and to show that comparisons between responses to full-field (FF) and smaller stimuli can be useful in diagnosing and monitoring disorders of the peripheral retina without the need for lengthy dark adaptation periods.


METHOD
The triple silent substitution technique was used to isolate L-cone-, M-cone- and rod-driven ERGs with 19, 18 and 33% photoreceptor contrasts, respectively, under identical mean luminance conditions. Experiments were conducted on five normal subjects and three RP patients. ERGs on control subjects were recorded at nine different temporal frequencies (between 2 and 60 Hz) for five different stimulus sizes: FF, 70°, 60°, 50° and 40° diameter circular stimuli. Experiments on RP patients involved rod- and L-cone-driven ERG measurements with FF and 40° stimuli at 8 and 48 Hz. Response amplitudes were defined as those of the first harmonic component after Fourier analysis.


RESULTS
In normal subjects, rod-driven responses displayed a fundamentally different behavior than cone-driven responses, particularly at low temporal frequencies. At low and intermediate temporal frequencies (≤ 12 Hz), rod-driven signals increased by a factor of about four when measured with smaller stimuli. In contrast, L- and M-cone-driven responses in this frequency region did not change substantially with stimulus size. At high temporal frequencies (≥ 24 Hz), both rod- and cone-driven response amplitudes decreased with decreasing stimulus size. Signals obtained from rod-isolating stimuli under these conditions are likely artefactual. Interestingly, in RP patients, both rod-driven and L-cone-driven ERGs were similar using 40° and FF stimuli.


CONCLUSION
The increased responses with smaller stimuli in normal subjects to rod-isolating stimuli indicate that a fundamentally different mechanism drives the ERGs in comparison with the cone-driven responses. We propose that the increased responses are caused by stray light stimulating the peripheral retina, thereby allowing peripheral rod-driven function to be studied using the triple silent substitution technique at photopic luminances. The method is effective in studying impaired peripheral rod- and cone- function in RP patients.",29134295,2018,Rod- versus cone-driven ERGs at different stimulus sizes in normal subjects and retinitis pigmentosa patients.
187,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the longitudinal somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) characterization from acute to chronic injury following cervical hemi-contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, and correlate the MEPs & SEPs to the behavioral outcomes.


METHODS
Fifteen adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the hemi-contusion spinal cord injury at C5. Forelimb MEPs & SEPs were applied to 5 animals before injury and 3h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, 4w and 8w after injury respectively. Forelimb functional assessments, including Montoya staircase task and cylinder rearing test, were conducted on another 10 animals before injury and at 2w, 4w and 8w after injury respectively, as well as histological analysis of the cord at 8w after injury. A group correlation was performed between the MEPs & SEPs and behavioral outcomes.


RESULTS
The hemi-contusion injury resulted in unilateral tissue damage at the epicenter with loss of the ventral horns and lateral funiculus. Both ipsilateral and contralateral forelimb MEPs showed latency prolongation and amplitude reduction at 3h after injury. The MEPs amplitude increased with time after injury, but the ipsilateral amplitude was persistently lower than the contralateral amplitude. The ipsilateral MEPs latency increased with time after injury and was significantly longer than the contralateral MEPs latency. The ipsilateral SEPs amplitude dropped after injury and stayed at a lower level up to 8 weeks. There was no difference in the SEPs latency among time points and between sides. At 8 weeks after injury, the ipsilateral forelimb grasped 30% pellets while the contralateral forelimb close to 81%. An obvious decreased usage of the ipsilateral paw and increased usage of the contralateral paw were observed in rearing test after injury. The MEPs latency and amplitude correlated significantly with the forelimb motor function.


CONCLUSION
Cervical hemi-contusion SCI led to persistent changes in MEPs & SEPs of the ipsilateral forelimb, ipsilateral impairment in motor function and unilateral cord tissue damage. Reliable electrophysiology assessment was obtained in chronic phase due to unstable MEPs & SEPs of bilateral forelimb immediately after injury, which might reflect the underlying pathological processes. The present study further confirmed the link of the MEPs to the behavioral outcomes, supporting the longitudinal electrophysiology assessment for neurological impairment after SCI.",29138091,2018,Longitudinal electrophysiological changes after cervical hemi-contusion spinal cord injury in rats.
188,"IN BRIEF Rates of obesity and diabetes are growing, as are their costs. Because the two diseases share many key determinants, the paradigms for their treatment overlap. For both, optimal treatment involves a multidisciplinary team following the Chronic Care Model of health care delivery. Combined treatment programs that include 1) a low-calorie diet individualized to patients' preferences, 2) structured exercise that is also tailored to each patient, and 3) psychotherapy induce the largest weight changes in patients with diabetes. Although diet alone can achieve weight loss, exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy components can enhance the effects of dietary modification. A multidisciplinary team that includes a physician with expertise in pharmacotherapy, a nurse and/or nurse practitioner, a dietitian, an exercise physiologist, and a psychologist can provide a comprehensive weight loss program combining the most effective interventions from each discipline.",29151714,2017,Multidisciplinary Team-Based Obesity Treatment in Patients With Diabetes: Current Practices and the State of the Science.
189,"Pharmacotherapy is often used to target symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but does not provide definitive treatment, and side effects of daily medication are often problematic. Trauma-focused psychotherapies are more likely than drug treatment to achieve PTSD remission, but have high dropout rates and ineffective for a large percentage of patients. Therefore, research into drugs that might increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy is a logical avenue of investigation. The most promising drug studied as a catalyst to psychotherapy for PTSD thus far is 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as the recreational drug ""Ecstasy."" MDMA stimulates the release of hormones and neurochemicals that affect key brain areas for emotion and memory processing. A series of recently completed phase 2 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD show favorable safety outcomes and large effect sizes that warrant expansion into multi-site phase 3 trials, set to commence in 2018. The nonprofit sponsor of the MDMA drug development program, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is supporting these trials to explore whether MDMA, administered on only a few occasions, can increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Brain imaging techniques and animal models of fear extinction are elucidating neural mechanisms underlying the robust effects of MDMA on psychological processing; however, much remains to be learned about the complexities of MDMA effects as well as the complexities of PTSD itself.",29152674,2018,Progress and promise for the MDMA drug development program.

The present study evaluated the impact of 2.45GHz radiation exposure for 4h/day for 45days on behavioral and oxidative stress parameters in female Sprague Dawley rats. Behavioral tests of anxiety, learning and memory were started from day 38. Oxidative stress parameters were estimated in brain homogenates after sacrificing the rats on day 45. In morris water maze, elevated plus maze and light dark box test, the 2.45GHz radiation exposed rats elicited memory decline and anxiety behavior. Exposure decreased activities of super oxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione levels whereas increased levels of brain lipid peroxidation was encountered in the radiation exposed rats, showing compromised anti-oxidant defense. Expression of caspase 3 gene in brain samples were quantified which unraveled notable increase in the apoptotic marker caspase 3 in 2.45GHz radiation exposed group as compared to sham exposed group. No significant changes were observed in histopathological examinations and brain levels of TNF-α. Analysis of dendritic arborization of neurons showcased reduction in number of dendritic branching and intersections which corresponds to alteration in dendritic structure of neurons, affecting neuronal signaling. The study clearly indicates that exposure of rats to microwave radiation of 2.45GHz leads to detrimental changes in brain leading to lowering of learning and memory and expression of anxiety behavior in rats along with fall in brain antioxidant enzyme systems.",29153770,2018,Rats exposed to 2.45GHz of non-ionizing radiation exhibit behavioral changes with increased brain expression of apoptotic caspase 3.
191,"Syllables are often considered to be central to infant and adult speech perception. Many theories and behavioral studies on early language acquisition are also based on syllable-level representations of spoken language. There is little clarity, however, on what sort of pre-linguistic ""syllable"" would actually be accessible to an infant with no phonological or lexical knowledge. Anchored by the notion that syllables are organized around particularly sonorous (audible) speech sounds, the present study investigates the feasibility of speech segmentation into syllable-like chunks without any a priori linguistic knowledge. We first operationalize sonority as a measurable property of the acoustic input, and then use sonority variation across time, or speech rhythm, as the basis for segmentation. The entire process from acoustic input to chunks of syllable-like acoustic segments is implemented as a computational model inspired by the oscillatory entrainment of the brain to speech rhythm. We analyze the output of the segmentation process in three different languages, showing that the sonority fluctuation in speech is highly informative of syllable and word boundaries in all three cases without any language-specific tuning of the model. These findings support the widely held assumption that syllable-like structure is accessible to infants even when they are only beginning to learn the properties of their native language.",29156241,2018,Pre-linguistic segmentation of speech into syllable-like units.
192,"Odontocetes have specialized mandibular fats, the extramandibular (EMFB) and intramandibular fat bodies (IMFB), which function as acoustic organs, receiving and channeling sound to the ear during hearing and echolocation. Recent strandings of beaked whales suggest that these fat bodies are susceptible to nitrogen (N2 ) gas embolism and empirical evidence has shown that the N2 solubility of these fat bodies is higher than that of blubber. Since N2 gas will diffuse from blood into tissue at any blood/tissue interface and potentially form gas bubbles upon decompression, it is imperative to understand the extent of microvascularity in these specialized acoustic fats so that risk of embolism formation when diving can be estimated. Microvascular density was determined in the EMFB, IMFB, and blubber from 11 species representing three odontocete families. In all cases, the acoustic tissues had less (typically 1/3 to 1/2) microvasculature than did blubber, suggesting that capillary density in the acoustic tissues may be more constrained than in the blubber. However, even within these constraints there were clear phylogenetic differences. Ziphiid (Mesoplodon and Ziphius, 0.9 ± 0.4% and 0.7 ± 0.3% for EMFB and IMFB, respectively) and Kogiid families (1.2 ± 0.2% and 1.0 ± 0.01% for EMFB and IMFB, respectively) had significantly lower mean microvascular densities in the acoustic fats compared to the Delphinid species (Tursiops, Grampus, Stenella, and Globicephala, 1.3 ± 0.3% and 1.3 ± 0.3% for EMFB and IMFB, respectively). Overall, deep-diving beaked whales had less microvascularity in both mandibular fats and blubber compared to the shallow-diving Delphinids, which might suggest that there are differences in the N2 dynamics associated with diving regime, phylogeny, and tissue type. These novel data should be incorporated into diving physiology models to further understand potential functional disruption of the acoustic tissues due to changes in normal diving behavior.",29178494,2017,Microvascular characteristics of the acoustic fats: Novel data suggesting taxonomic differences between deep and shallow-diving odontocetes.
193,"How we imagine and subjectively experience the future can inform how we make decisions in the present. Here, we examined a prosocial effect of imagining future episodes in motivating moral decisions about helping others in need, as well as the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Across three experiments we found that people are more willing to help others in specific situations after imagining helping them in those situations. Manipulating the spatial representation of imagined future episodes in particular was effective at increasing intentions to help others, suggesting that scene imagery plays an important role in the prosocial effect of episodic simulation. Path modeling analyses revealed that episodic simulation interacts with theory of mind in facilitating prosocial responses but can also operate independently. Moreover, we found that our manipulations of the imagined helping episode increased actual prosocial behavior, which also correlated with changes in reported willingness to help. Based on these findings, we propose a new model that begins to capture the multifaceted mechanisms by which episodic simulation contributes to prosocial decision-making, highlighting boundaries and promising future directions to explore. Implications for research in moral cognition, imagination, and patients with impairments in episodic simulation are discussed.",29178984,2018,Moral imagination: Facilitating prosocial decision-making through scene imagery and theory of mind.
194,"Disaccharides play an important role in survival of anhydrobiotic organisms during extreme environmental conditions. A key protection feature is their capability to form the hydrogen bond (HB) network in a similar fashion as the one made by water. Since various ions also affect the HB network in completely hydrated systems, it is of a great interest to understand how they impact preservation when incorporated in a disaccharide network. To address this, we employ a combination of experimental and modeling techniques to study behavior of multilamellar 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes freeze-dried with sucrose in presence of NaCl or NaH2PO4·H2O at various concentrations (0.01-1M). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed in order to determine the cooperative unit size (CUS), the number of lipid molecules that constitute a domain of cooperative motion in the liposome, and the melting temperature (Tm). In the absence of salt CUS was estimated to be 122±12, whereas in the presence of NaCl CUS increases more (347±34 for c=1M) than for NaH2PO4·H2O (193±26 for 1M). When it comes to Tm, the situation is reversed; NaCl induces increase by about 1K, while NaH2PO4·H2O by about 10K. These findings clearly demonstrate how different interaction forces-hydrogen bonding, charge pairing, and van der Waals interactions between acyl chains-affect CUS and Tm. Their interplay and contribution of particular interaction was further analyzed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This analysis demonstrated that the HB network of DMPC and sucrose is partially disrupted in the presence of NaCl ions, and even to a greater extent in the case of NaH2PO4·H2O ions. Notably, H2PO4- ions outcompete and replace the sucrose molecules at the DMPC surface, which in turn alters the nature of the DMPC-surrounding interactions, from a weaker HB-dominated to a stronger CP-dominated interaction network.",29179944,2018,Ion-induced modification of the sucrose network and its impact on melting of freeze-dried liposomes.

195,"Attachment relationships play an important role in people's wellbeing and affliction with physical and mental illnesses, including eating disorders. Seven reviews from the clinical field have consistently shown that higher attachment insecurity-failure to form trusting and reliable relationships with others-systematically characterized individuals with eating disorders. Nevertheless, to date, it is unclear whether (and if so how) these findings apply to the population at large. Consequently, the objective of the present meta-analysis is to quantify the relationship between attachment and unhealthy and healthy eating in the general population. Data from 70 studies and 19,470 participants were converted into r effect sizes and analysed. Results showed that higher attachment insecurity (r = 0.266), anxiety (r = 0.271), avoidance (r = 0.119), and fearfulness (r = 0.184) was significantly associated with more unhealthy eating behaviors, ps = 0.000; conversely, higher attachment security correlated with lower unhealthy eating behaviors (r = -0.184, p = 0.000). This relationship did not vary across type of unhealthy eating behavior (i.e., binge eating, bulimic symptoms, dieting, emotional eating, and unhealthy food consumption). The little exploratory evidence concerning healthy eating and attachment was inconclusive with one exception-healthy eating was associated with lower attachment avoidance (r = -0.211, p = 0.000). Our results extend previous meta-analytic findings to show that lack of trusting and reliable relationships does not only set apart eating disordered individuals from controls, but also characterizes unhealthy eating behaviors in the general population.

The cumulative effect of too much sedentary behavior may contribute to weight gain and obesity.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohorts and randomized controlled studies to determine the association between sedentary behavior and body weight and obesity in adults.


DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION
Relevant studies were identified from searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and PubMed databases up to May 2017, and by manual searches of in-text citations. Studies that evaluated the association in adults between sedentary behavior and body weight or obesity, while controlling for physical activity, were included. Overall, 31 publications met the eligibility criteria, including 23 prospective cohort studies with data that could be extracted for a quantitative meta-analysis, and a single randomized controlled trial.


RESULTS
There were no significant associations between sedentary behavior and any measure of body weight or obesity, with the exception of waist circumference. For the latter outcome, over a 5-year follow-up period, each 1 h per day increase-from baseline to follow-up-in sedentary behavior was associated with a 0.02 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.04; p = 0.001) increase in waist circumference. The odds ratio of becoming overweight or obese was 1.33 (95% CI 1.11-1.60; p = 0.001) in the highest compared with lowest categories of sedentary behavior.


CONCLUSIONS

198,"The use of feeding tubes in pediatric medical procedures and management has dramatically increased over the last three decades. With this increase, the prevalence of Feeding Tube Dependency (FTD) - a reliance on enteral feeding following medical recovery due to lack of oral intake of nutrition, despite being able to eat- has increased too. It has been suggested, that cases with FTD show avoidant feeding behaviours such as food refusal, gagging or swallowing resistance, but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. In a German population of 146 cases requesting feeding tube dependency treatment between 2005 and 2008 the frequency of occurrence of avoidant behaviour in FTD cases has been evaluated and was correlated to growth. The study includes children under 50 months of age being tube fed for at least three months. Parents received the Anamnestic Questionnaire for Feeding Disorder and Tube Weaning (AFT), which evaluates nutritional supply, tube feeding, feeding disorder symptoms, medical diagnosis, growth and psychosocial variables. The study group was comprised of 101 children (50 male, 51 female), with a median age of 15 months (IQR: 10-26.5) and a median tube feeding duration of 13 months (IQR: 8-27). The most prevalent medical diagnoses were congenital malformations (n = 51) and prematurity (n = 27). Parents reported daily symptoms of food aversion through all age groups, like food refusal 2 (IQR: 1-3), gagging 1 (IQR: 0-3), vomiting 1 (0.1-2) and total symptoms 6 (5-11). Vomiting was negatively correlated with weight and length percentile and head circumference. Cases with FTD show frequent and persistent food avoidant behaviors, which may be explain the need for specific psychological treatment during transitioning from tube dependency to oral eating.",29198971,2018,Characteristics of feeding tube dependency with respect to food aversive behaviour and growth.

200,"It is now recognized that emotions can influence food intake. While some people report eating less when distressed, others report either no change of eating or eating more in the same condition. The question whether this interindividual variability also occurs in response to positive emotions has been overlooked in most studies on Emotional Eating (EE). Using the Emotional Appetite Questionnaire (EMAQ) and Latent Profile Analysis, this study aimed to examine the existence of latent emotion-induced changes in eating profiles, and explore how these profiles differ by testing their relations with 1) age and sex, 2) BMI and risk for eating disorders (ED) and 3) factors that are known to be associated with EE such as perceived positive/negative feelings, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and impulsivity. Among 401 university students (245 females) who completed the EMAQ, 3 profiles emerged (P1:11.2%, P2:60.1%, P3:28.7%), with distinct patterns of eating behaviors in response to negative emotions and situations but few differences regarding positive ones. Negative emotional overeaters (P1) and negative emotional undereaters (P3) reported similar levels of emotional distress and positive feelings, and were at greater risk for ED. However, the people in the former profile i) reported decreasing their food intake in a positive context, ii) were in majority females, iii) had higher BMI and iv) were more prone to report acting rashly when experiencing negative emotions. Our findings suggest that a person-centred analysis of the EMAQ scores offers a promising way to capture the inter-individual variability of emotionally-driven eating behaviors. These observations also add to the growing literature underscoring the importance of further investigating the role of different facets of impulsivity in triggering overeating and to develop more targeted interventions of EE.",29203443,2018,Examination of emotion-induced changes in eating: A latent profile analysis of the Emotional Appetite Questionnaire.
201,"It is well established that stress is linked to changes in eating behaviors. Research using adult populations has shown that stress is associated with both increases and decreases in the amount and type of food consumed. However, due to a lack of research reviews, the relationship between stress and eating behaviors in children is unclear. This systematic research review and meta-analysis aimed to identify whether stress is associated with healthy and unhealthy eating behaviors in children aged 8-18 years. Studies were included in the review if they measured stress and included a measure of food consumption. All unique studies retrieved (N = 28,070) were assessed for their eligibility at title, abstract and full text levels. A total of 13 studies were included in the final review and data were analysed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. Using random-effects modelling, overall stress was not associated with a change in overall eating behaviors. However, additional analyses indicated stress was associated with unhealthy eating behaviors in both younger (Hedge's g = 0.283, p < 0.001) and older (Hedge's g = 0.274, p = 0.001) children. In contrast, stress was not associated with healthy eating behaviors in younger children (Hedge's g = 0.093, p = 0.156), but was negatively associated with healthy eating behaviors in older children (Hedge's g = -0.384, p < 0.001). The current findings are concerning as they suggest the impact of stress on unhealthy eating may begin as early as 8 or 9 years old. Future research ought to investigate further the role of psychological, behavioral and endocrine factors in the development of stress-related eating in children.",29203444,2018,Stress and eating behaviors in children and adolescents: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
202,"Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating or feeding disorder characterized by inadequate nutritional or caloric intake leading to weight loss, nutritional deficiency, supplement dependence, and/or significant psychosocial impairment. DSM-5 lists three different eating patterns that can lead to symptoms of ARFID: avoidance of foods due to their sensory properties (e.g., picky eating), poor appetite or limited interest in eating, or fear of negative consequences from eating. Research on the prevalence and psychopathology of ARFID is limited by the lack of validated instruments to measure these eating behaviors. The present study describes the development and validation of the nine-item ARFID screen (NIAS), a brief multidimensional instrument to measure ARFID-associated eating behaviors. Participants were 455 adults recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, 505 adults recruited from a nationally-representative subject pool, and 311 undergraduates participating in research for course credit. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence for three factors. The NIAS subscales demonstrated high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, invariant item loadings between two samples, and convergent/discriminant validity with other measures of picky eating, appetite, fear of negative consequences, and psychopathology. The scales were also correlated with measures of ARFID-like symptoms (e.g., low BMI, low fruit/vegetable variety and intake, and eating-related psychosocial interference/distress), although the picky eating, appetite, and fear scales had distinct independent relationships with these constructs. The NIAS is a brief, reliable instrument that may be used to further investigate ARFID-related eating behaviors.",29208483,2018,Initial validation of the Nine Item Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake disorder screen (NIAS): A measure of three restrictive eating patterns.

204,"Being caressed represents one of the most typical expressions of affection conveyed by touch. Converging evidence suggests that the pleasant perception of gentle and slow stroking delivered to the hairy skin is mediated by C-Tactile afferents (CTs). While behavioral and neural responses to CT-optimal touch have been moderately explored so far, less is known about the autonomic reaction to different kinds of touch (both CT-optimal and not). Here, we investigated whether physiological arousal varies as a function of the specific tactile stimulation provided. Stroking (slow: 3 cm/s 'CT-optimal'; or fast: 30 cm/s) and tapping (random or fixed spatial order) stimulations were delivered to the participants' forearm with a brush, for durations of 9 or 60 s. Participants' skin conductance response (SCR) and level (SCL), as well as subjective evaluations, were recorded. The results revealed that being stroked (at both the velocities) induced higher SCR and SCL than being tapped. Moreover, while higher SCR was elicited by CT-suboptimal stroking compared to CT-optimal stroking, SCL was not affected differently by CT-optimal touch. No differences were found between the effects of 9 and 60 s stimulations. Slow stroking was evaluated as the most pleasant, relaxing and 'social' type of touch compared to the other tactile stimulations. Taken together, these findings shed light on the psychophysiological responses to stroking (including CT-optimal touch) and tapping, and contribute to elucidate the mechanisms underlying hedonic tactile perception.",29214391,2018,Stroking and tapping the skin: behavioral and electrodermal effects.
205,"OBJECTIVE
Modern neuroscience research requires electrophysiological recording of local field potentials (LFPs) in moving animals. Wireless transmission has the advantage of removing the wires between the animal and the recording equipment but is hampered by the large number of data to be sent at a relatively high rate.


APPROACH
To reduce transmission bandwidth, we propose an encoder/decoder scheme based on adaptive non-uniform quantization. Our algorithm uses the current transmitted codeword to adapt the quantization intervals to changing statistics in LFP signals. It is thus backward adaptive and does not require the sending of side information. The computational complexity is low and similar at the encoder and decoder sides. These features allow for real-time signal recovery and facilitate hardware implementation with low-cost commercial microcontrollers.


MAIN RESULTS
As proof-of-concept, we developed an open-source neural recording device called NeRD. The NeRD prototype digitally transmits eight channels encoded at 10 kHz with 2 bits per sample. It occupies a volume of 2  ×  2  ×  2 cm3 and weighs 8 g with a small battery allowing for 2 h 40 min of autonomy. The power dissipation is 59.4 mW for a communication range of 8 m and transmission losses below 0.1%. The small weight and low power consumption offer the possibility of mounting the entire device on the head of a rodent without resorting to a separate head-stage and battery backpack. The NeRD prototype is validated in recording LFPs in freely moving rats at 2 bits per sample while maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (>30 dB) over a range of noisy channels.


SIGNIFICANCE
Adaptive quantization in neural implants allows for lower transmission bandwidths while retaining high signal fidelity and preserving fundamental frequencies in LFPs.",29219118,2018,Adaptive quantization of local field potentials for wireless implants in freely moving animals: an open-source neural recording device.
206,"Maternal separation stress (MS) is a model of early life stress performed by the separation between dam and pups in the first days of life. This model has been associated with eating behavior and dopaminergic system abnormal phenotypes. This study aims to investigate whether maternal separation in the light or dark phase of the circadian cycle promotes phenotypic adjustments in the eating behavior and the dopamine system in both males and females. Lactating Wistar rats were separated from their litters from postnatal day 1 (PND 1) to PND 14 for 6 h in the light or dark phase of the circadian cycle. The groups of female control (FC), male control (MC), female rat separated in the dark (FSD), male rat separated in the dark (MSD), female rat separated in the light (FSL), and male rat separated in the light (MSL) were composed. The assessment of food intake was performed at the age of 120-150 days and the analysis of brainstem drd1a and drd2a dopamine receptors expression at 180 days of life. Maternal separation promoted higher palatable diet intake independent on sex and circadian cycle. On the other hand, drd1a and drd2a dopamine receptors expression were higher only in males separated in the dark phase of the circadian cycle. These findings demonstrate that maternal separation effects on feeding behavior do not depend on sex and circadian cycle, but the effects on dopamine receptors expression depend on sex and circadian cycle.",29229410,2018,"Pre-weaning maternal separation increases eating later in life in male and female offspring, but increases brainstem dopamine receptor 1a and 2a only in males."

208,"OBJECTIVES
Demographic, physical and psychological associations of successful aging (SA) have been evaluated, but occupational factors have not. Nor has SA been evaluated in a specific occupational group. The aims of this study were to examine the occupational associations of SA in older physicians, and to explore the concept of occupational SA.


METHODS
Physicians aged 55+ years completed self-ratings of occupational and personal SA on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS; 1 being ""least successful"" and 10 ""most successful""). Associations between occupational and personal SA (defined as 8-10 on the VAS), respectively, and demographic and practice characteristics; health; social and financial resources; cognitive, emotional and motivational resources; work centrality; and anxiety about aging were examined.


RESULTS
Rates of occupational SA (69.2%; 95% CI: 66.3-72.0) were significantly higher than personal SA (63.1%; 95% CI: 60.1-66.0) in the sample of 1,048 physicians. Occupational and personal SA were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.73, N = 1,041, p < 0.001). Personal SA was predicted by demographic (older age, female, international medical graduate, urban practice), physical (better self-rated health), psychological (less depression, better cognitive, emotional and motivational resources, and greater anxiety about aging), and occupational (higher work centrality, fewer practice adaptations and not intending to retire) factors.


CONCLUSIONS
Occupational factors are central to physicians' self-conceptualization of SA. That greater work centrality, fewer work adaptations and less retirement planning were associated with personal SA suggests older physicians' sense of ""success"" is intertwined with continuing practice. There is a need for educating physicians to adapt to aging and retirement.",29239799,2018,Occupational Determinants of Successful Aging in Older Physicians.
209,"INTRODUCTION
Bicycling is a health-promoting physical activity, but little is known about the factors that influence this behavior in the U.S. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to identify multilevel ecologic correlates of bicycling behaviors in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.


METHODS
This analysis, conducted in 2016-2017, utilized data from the 2012 National Survey of Bicyclist and Pedestrian Attitudes and Behaviors (n=7,509; N=246,155,593). Weighted logistic regression models were utilized to examine the association between intrapersonal, perceived environment, and objective environment variables and total, recreation, and transportation bicycling.


RESULTS
Significant differences were identified when bicyclists were compared with non-bicyclists. Respondents whose most recent ride was for recreation had significantly higher odds of being male, younger, white, and college educated, and significantly lower odds of being retired or a homemaker. Respondents who reported that their most recent ride was for transportation had significantly higher odds of being male, younger, and a student, and had significantly lower odds of being a high school graduate. Transportation riders also had significantly higher odds of perceived presence of a bike lane or path within one-quarter mile of their residence, and living in a more rural area.


CONCLUSIONS
In the U.S., recreation bicycling is a choice-based behavior, whereas transportation bicycling may be more influenced by the perceived and objective built environment. Interventions should consider how to make recreation and transportation bicycling more accessible and affordable to all individuals.",29241723,2018,Intrapersonal and Environmental Correlates of Bicycling in U.S. Adults.
210,"The recognition of eating disorders (EDs) in males represents an ongoing challenge for physicians. This challenge is particularly complex in the case of EDs that are oriented toward muscularity, as opposed to thinness, which current diagnostic criteria do not accommodate. Nevertheless, EDs in males, and muscularity-oriented disordered eating (MODE) in particular, are increasingly prevalent and are likely to be encountered in clinical practice. We report the case of a 16-year-old male who presented with medical instability, requiring hospitalization, in the context of MODE. Importantly, this patient did not meet formal diagnostic criteria for a specific ED, and behavioral symptoms were deemed goal oriented in the context of high school wrestling pursuits. This case highlights the challenges of identifying MODE and the medical risks associated therein.

211,"PURPOSE
Cigarette smoking among youth is associated with poorer health and psychosocial outcomes. However, few studies address how smoking may differentially relate to the emergence of disparities in functioning across races/ethnicities over adolescence.


METHODS
Youth (n = 2,509) were surveyed eight times from ages 11 to 18. We measured cigarette use, academic and social functioning, mental and physical health, and delinquency. Sequelae of change models controlled for sociodemographic factors, and tested whether intercept and slope for smoking trajectories were associated with outcomes at the end of high school, and examined racial/ethnic differences in outcomes assuming similar smoking trajectories across groups.


RESULTS
Youth were 45% Hispanic, 20% Asian, 20% white, 10% multiethnic, 2% black, and 1% other ethnicities. Higher average probability of smoking and steeper slopes of smoking trajectories were associated with poorer outcomes in multiple domains. Controlling for smoking trajectories, we observed the following disparities (vs. white youth; all p's < .05): black, Hispanic, and multiethnic youth reported lower academic performance; Asian, black, and multiethnic youth reported higher academic unpreparedness; Asian and multiethnic youth reported poorer mental health; Asian, Hispanic, and multiethnic youth reported poorer physical health; and Asian youth reported higher delinquency and poorer social functioning.


CONCLUSIONS
Statistically adjusting for similar smoking trajectories, racial/ethnic minority youth demonstrated poorer outcomes in multiple domains compared with white peers. Smoking may be a particularly robust marker for risk of negative outcomes in racial/ethnic minority youth. Screening for cigarette use and intervening on smoking and associated risk behaviors among minority youth may help reduce disparities in functioning.",29248389,2018,"Ethnic Differences in Cigarette Use Trajectories and Health, Psychosocial, and Academic Outcomes."
212,"PURPOSE
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective and safe intervention to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in men who have sex with men; current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines indicate its use among high-risk adults. Adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) also have significant HIV risk, but implementation strategies are likely to differ for this population. We aimed to estimate impact and efficiency of PrEP for ASMM in higher prevalence US settings, using a variety of implementation strategies and assumptions about coverage, adherence, and background prevalence.


METHODS
We develop a stochastic, dynamic, network-based model, parametrized using numerous ASMM behavioral and clinical data sources. We simulate 10 years with and without PrEP, comparing percent of incident infections averted (impact) and number of person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency).


RESULTS
Our main scenario (PrEP for 16- to 18-year-old ASMM, initiating PrEP 6 months after first anal intercourse, 40% coverage, adherence profiles from the ATN 113 trial; 2.9% background HIV prevalence among ASMM) prevents 27.8% of infections, with 38 person-years on PrEP per infection averted. Expanding implementation to cover younger ages or earlier initiation has small effects on impact and efficiency. Targeting highest risk ASMM increases efficiency, but requires querying sexual histories. Across levels examined, coverage and adherence do not have major impacts on efficiency, whereas background prevalence does.


CONCLUSIONS
PrEP can have a large impact on HIV incidence among ASMM in the United States, especially in settings with high prevalence. However, willingness of, and support for, providers will be central to achieving the coverage needed to make this a success.",29248392,2018,Targeting Human Immunodeficiency Virus Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis to Adolescent Sexual Minority Males in Higher Prevalence Areas of the United States: A Modeling Study.
213,"The use of hybrid self-assembling peptide (EFK8)-carbon nanotube (SWNT) hydrogels for tissue engineering and in vitro 3D cancer spheroid formation is reported. These hybrid hydrogels are shown to enhance the attachment, spreading, proliferation and movement of NIH-3T3 cells relative to that observed using EFK8-only hydrogels. After five days, ∼30% more cells are counted when the hydrogel contains SWNTs. Also, 3D encapsulation of these cells when injected in hydrogels does not adversely affect their behavior. Compressive modulus measurements and microscopic examination suggest that SWNTs have this beneficial effect by providing sites for cell anchorage, spreading and movement rather than by increasing hydrogel stiffness. This shows that the cells have a particular interaction with SWNTs not shared with EFK8 nanofibers despite a similar morphology. The effect of EFK8 and EFK8-SWNT hydrogels on A549 lung cancer cell behavior is also investigated. Increasing stiffness of EFK8-only hydrogels from about 44 Pa to 104 Pa promotes a change in A549 morphology from spheroidal to a stretched one similar to migratory phenotype. EFK8-SWNT hydrogels also promote a stretched morphology, but at lower stiffness. These results are discussed in terms of the roles of both microenvironment stiffness and cell-scaffold adhesion in cancer cell invasion. Overall, this study demonstrates that applications of peptide hydrogels in vitro can be expanded by incorporating SWNTs into their structure which further provides insight into cell-biomaterial interactions.


STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
For the first time we used hybrid self-assembling peptide-carbon nanotube hybrid hydrogels (that we have recently introduced briefly in the ""Carbon"" journal in 2014) for tissue engineering and 3D tumor engineering. We showed the potential of these hybrid hydrogels to enhance the efficiency of the peptide hydrogels for tissue engineering application in terms of cell behavior (cell attachment, spreading and migration). This opens up new rooms for the peptide hydrogels and can expand their applications. Also our system (peptide and peptide-CNT hydrogels) was used for cancer cell spheroid formation showing the effect of both tumor microenvironment stiffness and cell-scaffold adhesion on cancer cell invasion. This was only possible based on the presence of CNTs in the hydrogel while the stiffness kept constant. Finally it should be noted that these hybrid hydrogels expand applications of peptide hydrogels through enhancing their capabilities and/or adding new properties to them.",29248638,2017,Peptide and peptide-carbon nanotube hydrogels as scaffolds for tissue & 3D tumor engineering.

This study views customers' use of menu labels as a preventive health behavior and applies the Health Belief Model (HBM) with the aim of determining the health belief factors that influence customers' use of menu labels. A self-administered survey was distributed for data collection. Responses were collected from 335 restaurant customers who experienced menu labels in restaurants within three months prior to the survey. The results of a structural equation model showed that all the HBM variables (perceived threats, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers of using menu labels) positively affected the customers' use of menu labels. Perceived threats were influenced by cues to action and cues to action had an indirect influence on menu label use through perceived threats. In conclusion, health beliefs were good predictors of menu label use on restaurant menus. This study validated the application of the HBM to menu labeling in restaurants, and its findings could offer guidelines for the industry and government in developing strategies to expand the use of menu labels among the public.",29248690,2018,Application of the Health Belief Model to customers' use of menu labels in restaurants.
215,"Both social perception and temperament in young infants have been related to social functioning later in life. Previous functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2009) showed larger blood-oxygenation changes for social compared to non-social stimuli in the posterior temporal cortex of five-month-old infants. We sought to replicate and extend these findings by using fNIRS to study the neural basis of social perception in relation to infant temperament (Negative Affect) in 37 five-to-eight-month-old infants. Infants watched short videos displaying either hand and facial movements of female actors (social dynamic condition) or moving toys and machinery (non-social dynamic condition), while fNIRS data were collected over temporal brain regions. Negative Affect was measured using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Results showed significantly larger blood-oxygenation changes in the right posterior-temporal region in the social compared to the non-social condition. Furthermore, this differential activation was smaller in infants showing higher Negative Affect. Our results replicate those of Lloyd-Fox et al. and confirmed that five-to-eight-month-old infants show cortical specialization for social perception. Furthermore, the decreased cortical sensitivity to social stimuli in infants showing high Negative Affect may be an early biomarker for later difficulties in social interaction.",29248823,2017,Negative affect is related to reduced differential neural responses to social and non-social stimuli in 5-to-8-month-old infants: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy-study.

220,"This study presents a novel application of the cognitive processing model of alcohol craving (CPMA) from the addictions field to the role of food craving in the well-established restrained eating-overeating relationship associated with binge eating disorder (BED). A community sample (N = 1058, ages 18-66) completed an online survey assessing four core domains: restrained eating, trait food craving, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. In accordance with the CPMA, food craving emerged as a significant indirect effect of the association between restrained eating and both uncontrolled and emotional eating. Gender did not significantly moderate any direct or indirect associations, suggesting that gender may not change the pattern of association between restrained eating and different facets of overeating. Results suggest that treatments targeting binge eating behaviors may benefit from 1) explicitly addressing the activation of food craving rather than concentrating on reducing restrained eating and 2) recognizing that food craving may be an important gender-neutral target with the potential to reduce binge and overeating behaviors. Future research should extend these preliminary findings by examining the application of the CPMA to eating behaviors while jointly investigating antecedents and contextual factors.",29253669,2018,The role of craving in emotional and uncontrolled eating.

222,"Wild banded mongooses ( Mungos mungo) in northeastern Botswana and northwest Zimbabwe are infected with a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) pathogen, Mycobacterium mungi. We evaluated gross and histologic lesions in 62 infected mongooses (1999-2017). Many tissues contained multifocal irregular, lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous infiltrates and/or multifocal or coalescing noncaseating to caseating granulomas with variable numbers of intralesional acid-fast bacilli. Over one-third of nasal turbinates examined had submucosal lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous infiltrates, erosion and ulceration of the nasal mucosa, bony remodeling, and nasal distortion. Similar inflammatory cell infiltrates expanded the dermis of the nasal planum with frequent ulceration. However, even in cases with intact epidermis, acid-fast bacilli were present in variable numbers among dermal infiltrates and on the epidermal surface among desquamated cells and debris, most commonly in small crevices or folds. In general, tissue involvement varied among cases but was highest in lymph nodes (50/54, 93%), liver (39/53, 74%), spleen (37/51, 73%), and anal glands/sacs (6/8, 75%). Pulmonary lesions were present in 67% of sampled mongooses (35/52) but only in advanced disseminated disease. The pathological presentation of M. mungi in the banded mongoose is consistent with pathogen shedding occurring through scent-marking behaviors (urine and anal gland secretions) with new infections arising from contact with these contaminated olfactory secretions and percutaneous movement of the pathogen through breaks in the skin, nasal planum, and/or skin of the snout. Given the character and distribution of lesions and the presence of intracellular acid-fast bacilli, we hypothesize that pathogen spread occurs within the body through a hematogenous and/or lymphatic route. Features of prototypical granulomas such as multinucleated giant cells and peripheral fibrosis were rarely present in affected mongooses. Acid-fast bacilli were consistently found intracellularly, even in regions of necrosis. The mongoose genome has a unique deletion (RD1mon) that includes part of the encoding region for PPE68 (Rv3873), a gene co-operonic with PE35.

223,"In the scope of a research program aimed at developing new drugs for the treatment of central nervous system diseases, we describe herein the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 1-(4-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) piperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyethan-1-one (LQFM180). This compound showed antioxidant activity in two models, electroanalytical assays, and DPPH activity. Moreover, in behavioral tests as the open field test LQFM180 (9.4, 18.8, and 37.6 mg/kg, per oral (p.o.)), we detected anxiolytic-like activity. In the sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep test, LQFM180, in all doses, decreased the latency to sleep and increased sleep duration, indicating central depressant activity; moreover, in the chimney test, LQFM180 did not alter motor activity. LQFM180 (18.8 mg/kg, p.o.) increased the time and number of entries on open arms in the elevated plus maze test, suggesting anxiolytic-like activity, which was reversed by NAN-190 and p-chlorophenylalanine, indicating a role of the serotonergic pathway on this effect. In the forced swimming test, LFQM180 (18.8 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased immobility time, suggesting antidepressant-like activity, which was reversed by monoaminergic antagonists, indicating a role for the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic pathways. Competition binding assays showed that LQFM180 was able to bind to the α1B, 5-HT1A, and D2 receptors, however, within the low micromolar range. We conclude that LQFM180 should be considered as a scaffold for drug candidate development.",29260264,2018,"A new piperazine derivative: 1-(4-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) piperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyethan-1-one with antioxidant and central activity."
224,"OBJECTIVE
Electrical stimulation is a widely used and effective tool in systems neuroscience, neural prosthetics, and clinical neurostimulation. However, electrical artifacts evoked by stimulation prevent the detection of spiking activity on nearby recording electrodes, which obscures the neural population response evoked by stimulation. We sought to develop a method to clean artifact-corrupted electrode signals recorded on multielectrode arrays in order to recover the underlying neural spiking activity.


APPROACH
We created an algorithm, which performs estimation and removal of array artifacts via sequential principal components regression (ERAASR). This approach leverages the similar structure of artifact transients, but not spiking activity, across simultaneously recorded channels on the array, across pulses within a train, and across trials. The ERAASR algorithm requires no special hardware, imposes no requirements on the shape of the artifact or the multielectrode array geometry, and comprises sequential application of straightforward linear methods with intuitive parameters. The approach should be readily applicable to most datasets where stimulation does not saturate the recording amplifier.


MAIN RESULTS
The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in macaque dorsal premotor cortex using acute linear multielectrode array recordings and single electrode stimulation. Large electrical artifacts appeared on all channels during stimulation. After application of ERAASR, the cleaned signals were quiescent on channels with no spontaneous spiking activity, whereas spontaneously active channels exhibited evoked spikes which closely resembled spontaneously occurring spiking waveforms.


SIGNIFICANCE
We hope that enabling simultaneous electrical stimulation and multielectrode array recording will help elucidate the causal links between neural activity and cognition and facilitate naturalistic sensory protheses.",29265009,2018,ERAASR: an algorithm for removing electrical stimulation artifacts from multielectrode array recordings.
225,"SCOPE
Vitamin A (VA) is an essential nutrient for the development of the brain. We previously found that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a significant rate of VA deficiency (VAD). In the current study, we aim to determine whether VAD is a risk factor for the generation of autistic-like behaviors via the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ)-regulated cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38)-oxytocin (OXT) axis.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Gestational VAD or VA supplementation (VAS) rat models are established, and the autistic-like behaviors in the offspring rats are investigated. The different expression levels of RARβ and CD38 in hypothalamic tissue and serum retinol and OXT concentration are tested. Primary cultured rat hypothalamic neurons are treated with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), and recombinant adenoviruses carrying the rat RARβ (AdRARβ) or RNA interference virus RARβ-siRNA (siRARβ) are used to infect neurons to change RARβ signal. Western blotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and intracellular Ca2+ detections are used to investigate the primary regulatory mechanism of RARβ in the CD38-OXT signaling pathway. We found that gestational VAD increases autistic-like behaviors and decreases the expression levels of hypothalamic RARβ and CD38 and serum OXT levels in the offspring. VAS ameliorates these autistic-like behaviors and increases the expression levels of RARβ, CD38, and OXT in the gestational VAD pups. In vitro, atRA increases the Ca2+ excitability of neurons, which might further promote the release of OXT. Different CD38 levels are induced in the neurons by infection with different RARβ adenoviruses. Furthermore, atRA enhances the binding of RARβ to the proximal promoter of CD38, indicating a potential upregulation of CD38 transcriptional activity by RARβ.


CONCLUSIONS
Gestational VAD might be a risk factor for autistic-like behaviors due to the RARβ signal suppression of CD38 expression in the hypothalamus of the offspring, which improves with VAS during the early-life period. The nutritional status during pregnancy and the early-life period is important in rats.",29266770,2017,Vitamin A Deficiency Induces Autistic-Like Behaviors in Rats by Regulating the RARβ-CD38-Oxytocin Axis in the Hypothalamus.
226,"BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study was to rank the risk factors for dental caries among first-year university students in Nice (France).


METHODS
All first-year students are required to undergo a compulsory preventive medical examination. Among these students, volunteers were offered a dental visit. Information was collected through an interview followed by an oral examination. We assessed the volunteers' oral hygiene habits (daily toothbrushing frequency, type of toothbrush used, frequency of toothbrush replacement, place of toothpaste purchase, and flossing), daily health-related behaviors (number of main daily meals, daily sugary intakes, smoking, alcohol consumption, consumption of cannabis or other drugs), oral-health-related behaviors (self-reported oral health, dental visits during the past year, reason for the last dental consultation, and failure to seek dental care due to financial reasons), and oral health issues (dental crowding, oral hygiene, presence of caries, presence of pit and fissure sealant remnants). The dependent variable was the presence of at least one untreated carious lesion. The data were subjected to univariate analyses to select explanatory variables, and subsequently, a logistic regression was performed.


RESULTS
Six hundred twenty-nine students aged 18.8±1.6 years were enrolled in this study. The sex ratio was 0.72, with a strong predominance of the female gender. Only 59.3% of the students had never experienced dental caries, while 22.4% had already undergone restorative procedures and did not have any carious lesion at the time of the examination, and 11.6% presented with carious lesions and had never been treated by a dentist. Lastly, 6.7% had carious lesions despite evidence of prior restorative procedures. The multivariate analysis revealed the following pejorative risk factors: failure to seek dental care due to financial reasons (OR:3.06, 95% CI: 1.40-6.70), poor oral hygiene revealed during the oral examination (OR:2.59, 95% CI: 1.60-4.20), and poor self-reported oral health (OR:2.43, 95% CI: 1.24-4.77). Conversely, the analysis revealed the following protective factors: preventive visits to the dentist (OR:0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.99), the use of an electric toothbrush (OR:0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.77), and sealant remnants (OR:0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.97).

228,"This study investigated the association between inter-parental conflict at a single occasion, or repeated over early childhood, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems at 10-11 years; and examined potential mechanisms via social risk, maternal mental health, and parenting. Data were five time points from the Baby cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N = 3696, recruited in 2004). Verbal or physical inter-parental conflict was measured at 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, and 6-7 years. Internalizing and externalizing problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) were measured via mother-, father-, teacher-, and child-report at 10-11 years. A series of regression models accounted for social risk at 0-1 years, parenting, and maternal psychological distress at 8-9 years. Physical and verbal inter-parental conflict (reported by 16 and 33% of mothers, respectively) consistently predicted mother-, father-, and child-reported externalizing and internalizing problems, and teacher-reported externalizing (but not internalizing) problems (adjusted regression coefficients [β] = 0.4-1.1). Repeated compared to single report of verbal conflict was associated with more behavior problems (adjusted mean = 0.8-1.1 compared to 0.4-0.6).


CONCLUSION
Children are sensitive to inter-parental conflict, with long-term negative effects for child mental health even when reported at one time point within the first 6 years of life. What is Known: • Studies of children born prior to 1990 show that children exposed to verbal conflict or severe forms of family violence are at greater risk of mental health problems. What is New: • Physical and verbal inter-parental conflict reported once or at multiple time points over the first 6 years of life was associated with externalizing and internalizing problems reported by mothers, fathers, children, and teachers. • Associations between inter-parental conflict and child problems were not explained by family social risk, maternal mental health, or parenting.",29273942,2018,Repeated early-life exposure to inter-parental conflict increases risk of preadolescent mental health problems.
229,"Glucocorticoid receptors (GR) are ubiquitously expressed in metazoans. Different and contrasting phenotypes have been reported upon their activation. This study investigated the behavioral phenotypes characteristic of GR stimulation in male Wistar rats. Rats in each of the four groups of rats received one of the following treatments: distilled water (control) or one of three doses of dexamethasone (treatment) injected intraperitoneally for 7 days. The Rats were afterwards subjected to the Y maze, the elevated plus maze (EPM), the Morris water maze (MWM), and the novel object recognition (NOR) test. At the end of the study, the animals were anesthetized and neural activity from the prefrontal cortex recorded. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture to evaluate the levels of plasma insulin and glucose, and the prefrontal cortexes excised to determine the levels of insulin, markers of oxidative stress, and calcium in the homogenate. This study showed that treatment with dexamethasone significantly reduced the total and percentage alternation in the Y maze, but had no significant effect on object recognition in the NOR test, long-term and short-term spatial memory in the MWM, or anxiety-like behavior in the EPM. Plasma and brain insulin and calcium levels were elevated moderately following treatment with the lowest dose of dexamethasone. All doses of dexamethasone decreased brain superoxide dismutase and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels. No significant change in neural activity was observed. This study shows that activation of glucocorticoid receptors differentially affects different behavioral paradigms and provides evidence for a role for glucocorticoids in mediating insulin function in the brain.",29274871,2018,Glucocorticoid receptor activation selectively influence performance of Wistar rats in Y-maze.
230,"The molecular mechanism underlying the action of local anesthetics is still elusive. Phenylethanol (PEtOH) is an ingredient of essential oils with a rose-like odor and has been used as a local anesthetic. In this work, we have explored the effect of PEtOH on thermotropic behavior and organization of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membranes utilizing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our results indicate that the phase transition temperature of DPPC exhibited decrease with increasing PEtOH concentration. This is accompanied by hysteresis (difference in phase transition between the heating and cooling scans). We defined the threshold concentration of PEtOH as the concentration at which the difference in phase transition temperature between the heating and cooling thermograms is maximum. Interestingly, changes in enthalpy, entropy, and full width at half maximum displayed biphasic behavior beyond the threshold concentration of PEtOH. The biphasic change in thermodynamic parameters corresponding to phase transtition, coupled with hysteresis, is indicative of interdigitation in DPPC bilayers. We confirmed this proposition by SAXS measurements which show formation of the interdigitated phase in DPPC bilayers at and above the threshold concentration of PEtOH. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first report describing the interdigitation of membrane bilayers induced by PEtOH. We further show that the formation of interdigitated phase in DPPC bilayers depends on PEtOH concentration and temperature. Our results could be useful in ongoing efforts to address the mechanism of action of local anesthetics in model and biological membranes.",29275150,2018,Local anesthetics induce interdigitation and thermotropic changes in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers.

Although several investigators have disseminated structured criteria and visual inspection aids or strategies, inconsistencies in interpreting graphed data continue to exist even for individuals considered to be experts at interpreting SCED graphs. We propose a fail safe k metric that can be used in conjunction with visual inspection, and it can be used in-vivo after each additional data point is collected within a phase to determine the optimal point in time to shift between phases (e.g., from baseline to treatment). Preliminary proof of concept data are presented to demonstrate the potential utility of the fail safe k metric with a sample of previously published SCED graphs examining the effects on noncontingent reinforcement on occurrences of problem behavior. Results showed that if the value of fail safe k is equal to or less than the number of sessions in the current phase, then the data path may not be stable and more sessions should be run before changing phases. We discuss the results in terms of using the fail safe k as an additional aid for visual inspection of SCED data.",29277023,2018,Development of an in-vivo metric to aid visual inspection of single-case design data: Do we need to run more sessions?
232,"Although parents often report positive intentions to promote and create a healthy food environment for their children (e.g., setting limits to snacks offered), they also experience difficulties in translating these intentions into actual behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that automatic processes explain an important part of the gap between parents' intentions and their actual food parenting behaviors. We provide a conceptual framework in which we hypothesize that automatic effects on food parenting occur through two key interrelated constructs: habits (key outcome construct) and volitional regulation behaviors (key mediating construct). Moreover, we discuss potentially important impulse-focused techniques that may directly change habits (e.g., nudging; inhibitory control training) or indirectly through volitional regulation behaviors (e.g., implementation intentions; mental contrasting). We make use of the literature on the role of intention-behavior discordance in general health behaviors and discuss implications for food parenting practices. Our framework provides a dual process view towards food parenting and may help to explain when and why parents are likely to engage in (un)healthy food parenting behaviors. In addition, this framework may hopefully stimulate research on (combinations of old and) new techniques to promote good food parenting behaviors.",29277519,2018,How to bridge the intention-behavior gap in food parenting: Automatic constructs and underlying techniques.

Virtual reality technology allows for the creation of behavioral measures, and its implementation overcomes several limitations of existing methods. This report evaluates the validity and usability of the Virtual Reality (VR) Buffet among a sample of 52 parents of children aged 3-7. Participants served a meal of pasta and apple juice in both a virtual setting and real-world setting (counterbalanced and separated by a distractor task). They then created another meal for their child, this time choosing from the full set of food options in the VR Buffet. Finally, participants completed a food estimation task followed by a questionnaire, which assessed their perceptions of the VR Buffet. Results revealed that the amount of virtual pasta served by parents correlated significantly with the amount of real pasta they served, rs = 0.613, p < .0001, as did served amounts of virtual and real apple juice, rs = 0.822, p < .0001. Furthermore, parents' perception of the calorie content of chosen foods was significantly correlated with observed calorie content (rs = 0.438, p = .002), and parents agreed that they would feed the meal they created to their child (M = 4.43, SD = 0.82 on a 1-5 scale). The data presented here demonstrate that parent behavior in the VR Buffet is highly related to real-world behavior, and that the tool is well-rated by parents.

234,"BACKGROUND
Over 90 years after its first recording, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) remains one of the most widely used techniques in human neuroscience research, in particular for the study of event-related potentials (ERPs). However, because of its low signal-to-noise ratio, extracting useful information from these signals continues to be a hard-technical challenge. Many studies focus on simple properties of the ERPs such as peaks, latencies, and slopes of signal deflections.


NEW METHOD
To overcome these limitations, we developed the Wavelet-Information method which uses wavelet decomposition, information theory, and a quantification based on single-trial decoding performance to extract information from evoked responses.


RESULTS
Using simulations and real data from four experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms standard supervised analyses based on peak amplitude estimation. Moreover, the method can extract information using the raw data from all recorded channels using no a priori knowledge or pre-processing steps.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)
We show that traditional approaches often disregard important features of the signal such as the shape of EEG waveforms. Also, other approaches often require some form of a priori knowledge for feature selection and lead to problems of multiple comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach offers a new and complementary framework to design experiments that go beyond the traditional analyses of ERPs. Potentially, it allows a wide usage beyond basic research; such as for clinical diagnosis, brain-machine interfaces, and neurofeedback applications requiring single-trial analyses.",29277720,2018,Extracting information from the shape and spatial distribution of evoked potentials.

Neuroscience research in brain development and disorders can benefit from an in vivo animal model that portrays normal white matter (WM) development trajectories and has a sufficiently large cerebrum for imaging with human MRI scanners and protocols.


NEW METHOD
Twelve three-month-old Sinclair™ miniature pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) were longitudinally evaluated during adolescent development using advanced diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) focused on cerebral WM. Animals had three MRI scans every 23.95 ± 3.73 days using a 3-T scanner. The DWI imaging protocol closely modeled advanced human structural protocols and consisted of fifteen b-shells (b = 0-3500 s/mm2) with 32-directions/shell. DWI data were analyzed using diffusion kurtosis and bi-exponential modeling that provided measurements that included fractional anisotropy (FA), radial kurtosis, kurtosis anisotropy (KA), axial kurtosis, tortuosity, and permeability-diffusivity index (PDI).


RESULTS
Significant longitudinal effects of brain development were observed for whole-brain average FA, KA, and PDI (all p < 0.001). There were expected regional differences in trends, with corpus callosum fibers showing the highest rate of change.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)
Pigs have a large, gyrencephalic brain that can be studied using clinical MRI scanners/protocols. Pigs are less complex than non-human primates thus satisfying the ""replacement"" principle of animal research.


CONCLUSIONS

236,"Children appear to engage in emotional eating (i.e., eating in response to negative and positive emotions), but existing research has predominantly relied on parent-report and child-report, which may not necessarily reflect children's actual emotional eating behaviors. This study examined the effects of happiness and sadness on children's observed snack consumption and examined whether child characteristics (i.e., weight, gender, and age) interact with mood to predict snack consumption. To elicit mood, children (N = 91; Mages = 6.8 years; 48 boys) were randomly assigned to one of the three mood induction conditions (happy, sad, or neutral); children's snack consumption was observed and measured after mood induction. Findings showed that children in the sad condition consumed more energy from chocolate, followed by children in the happy condition, and then the neutral condition. However, the reverse pattern was observed for goldfish crackers: children in the neutral condition consumed more energy from this savory snack than children in the happy condition, followed by children in sad condition. Child weight status and gender did not interact with mood to predict snack consumption. Child age did interact with mood: older children consumed more chocolates in the sad condition compared to younger children. Child age was not related to snack consumption in the happy and neutral conditions. This study suggests that emotional eating in response to positive and negative emotions is evident during early childhood, but that this is behavior is developing during this period.",29278720,2018,The effects of happiness and sadness on Children's snack consumption.

238,"The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of soccer practice on bone in male and female children and adolescents. MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases were searched for scientific articles published up to and including October 2016. Twenty-seven studies were included in this systematic review (13 in the meta-analysis). The meta-analysis was performed by using OpenMeta[Analyst] software. It is well documented that soccer practice during childhood provides positive effects on bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) compared to sedentary behaviors and other sports, such as tennis, weightlifting, or swimming. Furthermore, soccer players present higher BMC and BMD in most weight-bearing sites such as the whole body, lumbar spine, hip, and legs. Moreover, bone differences were minimized between groups during prepuberty. Therefore, the maturity status should be considered when evaluating bone. According to meta-analysis results, soccer practice was positively associated with whole-body BMD either in males (mean difference 0.061; 95%CI, 0.042-0.079) or in females (mean difference 0.063; 95%CI, 0.026-0.099).


CONCLUSION
Soccer may be considered a sport that positively affects bone mass during growth. Pubertal soccer players presented increased bone mass compared to controls or other athletes; however, these bone differences are minimized during the prepubertal stage. What is known: • It has been described that childhood and adolescence are important periods for bone mass and structure. • Previous studies have demonstrated that soccer participation improves bone mass in male and female children and adolescents. What is new: • The differences between soccer players and controls are more marked during puberty than prepuberty. • Weight-bearing sites such as lumbar spine, hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanteric region and both legs are particularly sensitive to soccer actions.",29282554,2018,Soccer helps build strong bones during growth: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Oral health is a significant measure of overall health, and regular dental visits are recommended for the maintenance of oral health. The purpose of this study is to determine the pattern (amount and type) of, and factors associated with dental care use among Ontarians.


METHODS
Data from the 2014 cycle of the Canadian Community Health Survey was used and analysis was restricted to individuals aged 12 and above residing in Ontario. Dental care use was defined by two distinct outcomes: not visiting a dentist within the past year and visiting a dentist only for emergencies. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the association between socio-demographic, health behavior, oral health, and other health-related factors and the two outcomes.


RESULTS
More than a quarter of participants reported not visiting the dentist in the last year, and 19% reported usually visiting a dentist only for emergencies. Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that males, individuals of Aboriginal status, those with low educational attainment, low household income, no dental insurance, who smoked, less frequent teeth brushing, poor health of teeth and mouth, or had diabetes were at a significant increased likelihood of not visiting the dentist within the past year, and only visiting a dentist for emergency care.

Self-report measures are used to evaluate surgery outcome but are not necessarily indicative of actual disabilities.


RESEARCH QUESTION
The aim of the present study was to determine the association between self-report assessments of quality of life and objective measures of function in patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative disease. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of lumbar spinal fusion surgery on this relationship.


METHODS
Before and 6 month after surgery 26 patients completed self-report questionnaires and assessments of 3D gait analysis and trunk range of motion (ROM) during standing.


RESULTS
Before surgery, questionnaires were not correlated with any of the gait parameters and with only 2 trunk ROM parameters. Six month after surgery, the questionnaires showed 12 significant correlations with gait parameters and 19 with trunk ROM parameters. A better Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (r = 0.464, p = .026), EQ-5D (r = -0.440, p = .036), and EQ VAS (r = -0.472, p = .023) score were correlated with a reduced anterior thorax tilt during walking. Maximum forward flexion of the trunk during standing was correlated with a better EQ-5D (r = 0.684, p = .001) and ODI (r = -0.560, p = .008) score as well as with reduced pain scores.


SIGNIFICANCE
The lack of association between self-reported questionnaires and objective measures of function before surgery was likely due to psychological distress, correlating with emotional and cognitive function rather than true functional capacities. The influence of these psychological factors might be reduced after surgery due to a reduction of low back pain. To obtain an accurate assessment of impairment, there is a need to evaluate function by measuring objective physiologic parameters that are unsusceptible to voluntary or affective influences.",29287206,2017,Effect of lumbar spinal fusion surgery on the association of self-report measures with objective measures of physical function.
241,"Repeatedly offering vegetables has been shown to be one of the most effective methods for increasing acceptance and subsequent intake in young children. In order to increase successful offerings of vegetables and resultant consumption amongst young children, it is necessary to consider the influences on maternal reoffering of vegetables. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between mothers' tendency to reoffer vegetables and a range of demographic factors and psychological variables. A cross-sectional design was used, where mothers completed questionnaires assessing how often they reoffer rejected vegetables, concerns for economic factors, and a range of possible child and maternal influences. Mothers of preschool children were recruited from toddler groups across Leicestershire, UK, as well as online. Spearman's correlations were run to look for associations between demographic and psychological factors with maternal reoffering of vegetables. Significantly associated factors were then entered into a stepwise regression to predict maternal reoffering of vegetables. Mothers were significantly less likely to reoffer rejected vegetables if they were concerned about time, money, and waste, were influenced by their child's mood, or were concerned about their child having tantrums. Moreover, mothers who consumed more vegetables themselves reoffered vegetables more frequently. Regression analyses revealed that mothers' concern about food waste and tantrums, as well as maternal vegetable consumption, all significantly predicted mothers' reoffering of vegetables. With these findings in mind, mothers should be educated and supported with how to tackle and minimise children's tantrums during feeding, as well as being made aware of effective methods for avoiding food waste. Moreover, given that mothers' own vegetable consumption is associated with lower reoffering of vegetables to their child, interventions which seek to increase familial vegetable consumption should be pursued.",29287634,2018,If at first you don't succeed: Assessing influences associated with mothers' reoffering of vegetables to preschool age children.
242,"BACKGROUND
Monolayer cell cultures have been considered the most suitable technique for in vivo cellular experiments. However, a lot of cellular functions and responses that are present in natural tissues are lost in two-dimensional cell cultures. In this context, nanoparticle accumulation data presented in literature are often not accurate enough to predict behavior of nanoparticles in vivo. Cellular spheroids show a higher degree of morphological and functional similarity to the tissues.


METHODS
Accumulation and distribution of carboxylated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), chosen as model nanoparticles, was investigated in cellular spheroids composed of different phenotype mammalian cells. The findings were compared with the results obtained in in vivo experiments with human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. The diffusive transport model was used for theoretical nanoparticles distribution estimation.


RESULTS
QDs were accumulated only in cells, which were localized in the periphery of cellular spheroids. CdSe/ZnS QDs were shown to be stable and inert; they did not have any side-effects for cellular spheroids formation. Penetration of QDs in both cellular spheroids and in vivo tumor model was limited. The mathematical model confirmed the experimental results: nanoparticles penetrated only 25μm into cellular spheroids after 24h of incubation.


CONCLUSIONS
Penetration of negatively charged nanoparticles is limited not only in tumor tissue, but also in cellular spheroids.


GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE

243,"Attachment theory implies the causal influence of interpretation bias on the attachment-related expectations. Previous research demonstrated that training children to interpret maternal behavior as more supportive increased their trust in maternal support. The current study explored possible training effects on two attachment script-related processes: recollection of attachment-related memories and secure base script knowledge. Children (9-12 years old; N = 84) were assigned to either a secure training condition, training children to interpret mother's behavior as supportive, or a neutral placebo condition, where interpretations about maternal behavior were unrelated to support. Findings replicated the training effect on interpretation bias and trust. Furthermore, children's recollection of attachment-related memories became more positive. No training effect was found for secure base script knowledge.",29289759,2018,Interpretation bias in middle childhood attachment: Causal effects on attachment memories and scripts.
244,"The present study was designed to evaluate the combined effect of lithium and aripiprazole supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids in methylphenidate (MPD)-induced manic mice. Swiss albino mice were administered with MPD or saline for 14 days, and based on changes in behavioral activities animals were treated with lithium, aripiprazole, and omega-3 fatty acids from the 8th day. Behavioral patterns were analyzed by video tracking. Thyroxine, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone levels were assayed in serum using ELISA kits. The levels of neurotransmitters in the whole brain were analyzed spectrofluorometrically. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) mice brain mRNA expression levels and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) protein levels were measured using RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Results indicated that the administration of MPD alters the behavioral activity, thyroid hormones, FSH, LH, and testosterone levels. Lithium, aripiprazole, and omega-3 fatty acids alone significantly reduced MPD-induced behavior, hormonal, and neurotransmitter abnormalities. However, GSK3β and pAkt in the brain showed no significant differences in the level of expression. These results reveal that the combination of lithium and aripiprazole supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids provide protective effects against MPD-induced neuroendocrine system and multiple neurochemical abnormalities.",29290022,2018,Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation with lithium and aripiprazole for improving the balance of circulating hormones and brain neurotransmitters in manic mice model.

246,"Observation of ingestive and rumination behaviors of dairy cows may assist in detecting diseases, controlling reproductive status, and estimating intake. However, direct observation of cows on pasture is time consuming and can be difficult to realize. Consequently, different systems have been developed to automatically record behavioral characteristics; among them is the RumiWatch System (RWS; Itin and Hoch GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland). Until now, the RWS has not been thoroughly validated under grazing conditions. The aim of the current study was to validate the RWS, against direct observation, in measuring ingestive and rumination behaviors of dairy cows during grazing and supplementation in the barn. A further objective was to examine whether it is possible to refine the algorithm used by the evaluation software RumiWatch Converter 0.7.3.2 to improve the accuracy of the RWS. The data were collected from an experiment carried out with 18 lactating Holstein cows in a crossover block design including 3 treatments and 3 measuring periods. All cows grazed night and day, 19 h/d, and were either unsupplemented or supplemented, with chopped whole-plant corn silage, or chopped whole-plant corn silage mixed with a protein concentrate. During the measuring periods, cows were equipped with the RumiWatch Halter, and their ingestive and rumination behaviors were recorded concurrently by the RumiWatch Halter and by direct observation (690 × 10 min). Comparison of concurrently measured data shows that the RWS detected jaw movements reliably, but classification errors occurred. A low relative prediction error of ≤0.10 for the number of rumination boluses, rumination chews, and total eating chews was found. A high relative prediction error of >0.10 was found for the number of prehension bites and time spent in prehension and eating. Both converter versions performed equally well in differentiating ingestive and rumination behaviors when cows were supplemented in the barn or when grazing and supplementation activities were combined. For grazing cows, with no supplementation, more reliable results for the total number of eating chews, rumination chews, prehension bites, and time spent in these activities were obtained, by using the RumiWatch Converter 0.7.3.11. In light of these findings, further research is warranted to improve the accuracy of the RWS and to allow a differentiation between mastication chews and prehension bites while eating.",29290426,2018,Evaluation and validation of an automatic jaw movement recorder (RumiWatch) for ingestive and rumination behaviors of dairy cows during grazing and supplementation.
247,"Lameness is one of the most prevalent diseases affecting the welfare of cows in modern dairy production. Lameness leads to behavioral changes in severely lame cows, which have been investigated in much detail. For early detection of lameness, knowledge of the effects of moderate lameness on cow behavior is crucial. Therefore, the behavior of nonlame and moderately lame cows was compared on 17 Swiss dairy farms. On each farm, 5 to 11 nonlame (locomotion score 1 of 5) and 2 to 7 moderately lame (locomotion score 3 of 5) cows were selected for data collection in two 48-h periods (A, B) separated by an interval of 6 to 10 wk. Based on visual locomotion scoring, 142 nonlame and 66 moderately lame cows were examined in period A and 128 nonlame and 53 moderately lame cows in period B. Between these 2 periods, the cows underwent corrective hoof trimming. Lying behavior, locomotor activity, and neck activity were recorded by accelerometers (MSR145 data logger, MSR Electronics GmbH, Seuzach, Switzerland), and feeding and rumination behaviors by noseband sensors (RumiWatch halter, ITIN + HOCH GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland). Furthermore, visits to the brush and the concentrate feeder, and the milking order position were recorded. In comparison with nonlame cows, moderately lame cows had a longer lying duration, a longer average lying bout duration, and a greater lateral asymmetry in lying duration. Average locomotor activity, locomotor activity during 1 h after feed delivery or push-ups, and average neck activity were lower in moderately lame cows. Eating time and the number of eating chews (jaw movements) were reduced in moderately lame compared with nonlame cows, whereas no effect of moderate lameness was evident for ruminating time, number of ruminating chews and boluses, and average number of ruminating chews per bolus. Moderately lame cows visited the concentrate feeder and the brush less frequently, and they were further back in the milking order compared with nonlame cows. In conclusion, nonlame and moderately lame cows differed in a biologically relevant way in many of the behavioral variables investigated in this study. Therefore, the use of these behavioral changes seems to be promising to develop a tool for early lameness detection.",29290435,2018,Moderate lameness leads to marked behavioral changes in dairy cows.
248,"The objective of this study was to validate an ear-tag accelerometer sensor (CowManager SensOor, Agis Automatisering BV, Harmelen, the Netherlands) using direct visual observations in a grazing dairy herd. Lactating crossbred cows (n = 24) were used for this experiment at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center grazing dairy (Morris, MN) during the summer of 2016. A single trained observer recorded behavior every minute for 6 h for each cow (24 cows × 6 h = 144 h of observation total). Direct visual observation was compared with sensor data during August and September 2016. The sensor detected and identified ear and head movements, and through algorithms the sensor classified each minute as one of the following behaviors: rumination, eating, not active, active, and high active. A 2-sided t-test was conducted with PROC TTEST of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to compare the percentage of time each cow's behavior was recorded by direct visual observation and sensor data. For total recorded time, the percentage of time of direct visual observation compared with sensor data was 17.9 and 19.1% for rumination, 52.8 and 51.9% for eating, 17.4 and 11.9% for not active, and 7.9 and 21.1% for active. Pearson correlations (PROC CORR of SAS) were used to evaluate associations between direct visual observations and sensor data. Furthermore, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), bias correction factors, location shift, and scale shift (epiR package of R version 3.3.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were calculated to provide a measure of accuracy and precision. Correlations between visual observations for all 4 behaviors were highly to weakly correlated (rumination: r = 0.72, CCC = 0.71; eating: r = 0.88, CCC = 0.88; not active: r = 0.65, CCC = 0.52; and active: r = 0.20, CCC = 0.19) compared with sensor data. The results suggest that the sensor accurately monitors rumination and eating behavior of grazing dairy cattle. However, active behaviors may be more difficult for the sensor to record than others.",29290448,2018,"Technical note: Validation of an ear-tag accelerometer sensor to determine rumination, eating, and activity behaviors of grazing dairy cattle."
249,"INTRODUCTION
The integrated health care pilot model ""Gesundes Kinzigtal"" (GK) is recognized as a reference model for integrated healthcare in Germany. The aim of GK is to improve the health of the insured persons and, at the same time, to decrease their healthcare costs compared to usual care. The evaluation of GK has so far shown that GK might reach this aim. However, there are still no evaluation studies on GK focusing on patient-reported outcomes. This gap needs to be closed by a trend study, which is the main topic of this paper: We present interim results of this study, focusing on patient satisfaction with GK, insured persons' self-reported change of health behavior, their knowledge on health maintenance, and health-related quality of life.


METHOD
The baseline survey of the trend study was conducted in 2013: 3,034 members of GK were invited to complete a standardized questionnaire (by mail). In the first follow-up survey in 2015, 3,471 members were invited. Health-related quality of life was measured by EQ-5D and EQ-VAS; the other above-mentioned indicators were developed by our work group. Conducting variance analysis and logistic regression analysis using SPSS, it was analyzed to what extent the above-mentioned indicators changed between the first and the second survey.


RESULTS
The response rate was 23.4 % and 24.9 %, respectively. Overall patient satisfaction with GK and the mean EQ-5D value remained stable; the remaining indicators improved more or less over the course of time. Among these, the proportion of participants who indicated that they ""now lead an overall healthier life"" than before their enrolment into GK significantly increased from 25.6 % to 30.7 % (p=0.020).


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The significant increase in the proportion of respondents who ""now lead an overall healthier life"" might be attributed to the fact that patient activation and empowerment was (and is) a top priority of the GK management strategy. Caution is advised, though, with this interpretation because of the limitations inherent to trend studies without an appropriate control group.",29290571,2018,[Individual patient satisfaction in 'Gesundes Kinzigtal': Interim results of a trend study].
250,"Monodispersed La(OH)3:Eu nanospheres(core-NSs) were synthesized by urea-based homogeneous co-precipitation process, where mesoporous silica layer was coated over the surface of luminescent La(OH)3:Eu core-NSs. The XRD data exhibit the high crystalline, single hexagonal-shaped La(OH)3:Eu core and silica modified La(OH)3:Eu@mSiO2 (core-shell) NSs. Monodispersibility, spherical shaped, high surface area and mesoporosity were identified by TEM analysis and were further confirmed by BET analysis. The as-synthesized samples are highly soluble in aqueous media at ambient conditions. Spectroscopic analyses were also carried out to examine the impact of surface modification on structural, surface chemistry, optical and luminescence behavior of the as-designed silica coated core-shell NSs. The emission spectral study revealed that the luminescence intensity of magnetic-dipole transition (590 nm, 5D0 → 7F1) is dominant with respect to electric-dipole (614 nm, 5D0 → 7F2) transition. The high crystallinity of the hydroxide products supports the existence of good photoluminescence intensity, a good indication for their future use in detection of biomacromolecules through hypersensitive emission (614 nm, 5D0 → 7F2) transition. Excellent biocompatibility, cell viability and good luminescence properties suggested that the as-prepared core-shell NSs are an ideal candidate for luminescence biolabeling/bioimaging and as an optical bio-probe.",29291498,2018,"Highly biocompatible, monodispersed and mesoporous La(OH)3:Eu@mSiO2 core-shell nanospheres: Synthesis and luminescent properties."
251,"People engaged in interactive decision making rely on prior decision behaviors by other persons to make new choices and they exhibit inter-brain synchrony between each other. The functional meanings of such inter-brain synchrony, however, remains obscure. In the present study, dyads (15 pairs, all female) played the Prisoner's Dilemma game while their brain activities were recorded simultaneously by electroencephalography (EEG)-based hyperscanning technique. We manipulated the context of the game with higher versus lower cooperation index (HCI vs. LCI) and to each participant, we depicted the interaction as involving either another human partner or a machine (H-H vs. H-M). The results showed a higher cooperation rate and larger theta/alpha-band inter-brain synchrony in condition H-H than in H-M. In the condition H-H, there were larger centrofrontal theta-band and centroparietal alpha-band inter-brain synchrony in tasks set for high cooperation (HCI vs. LCI). Enhanced inter-brain synchrony covaried with increased cooperative choices observed between LCI and HCI. Furthermore, a subjective measure of perceived cooperativeness mediated the relationship between game context and inter-brain synchrony. These findings provide evidence for a role of cooperation on inter-brain synchrony during interactive decision making, and suggest distinct underlying neural processes recruited by cooperation contexts to enable high-level social cognitive processing in decision making.",29292232,2017,Inter-brain synchrony and cooperation context in interactive decision making.
252,"BACKGROUND
Recent advances in neurophysiological recording techniques have increased both the spatial and temporal resolution of data. New methodologies are required that can handle large data sets in an efficient manner as well as to make quantifiable, and realistic, predictions about the global modality of the brain from under-sampled recordings.


NEW METHOD
To rectify both problems, we first propose an analytical modification to an existing functional connectivity algorithm, Average Minimal Distance (AMD), to rapidly capture functional network connectivity. We then complement this algorithm by introducing Functional Network Stability (FuNS), a metric that can be used to quickly assess the global network dynamic changes over time, without being constrained by the activities of a specific set of neurons.


RESULTS
We systematically test the performance of AMD and FuNS (1) on artificial spiking data with different statistical characteristics, (2) from spiking data generated using a neural network model, and (3) using in vivo data recorded from mouse hippocampus during fear learning. Our results show that AMD and FuNS are able to monitor the change in network dynamics during memory consolidation.


COMPARISON WITH OTHER METHODS
AMD outperforms traditional bootstrapping and cross-correlation (CC) methods in both significance and computation time. Simultaneously, FuNS provides a reliable way to establish a link between local structural network changes, global dynamics of network-wide representations activity, and behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
The AMD-FuNS framework should be universally useful in linking long time-scale, global network dynamics and cognitive behavior.",29294309,2018,Functional network stability and average minimal distance - A framework to rapidly assess dynamics of functional network representations.
253,"This review paper shows that tungsten should not generally be used as a chronically implanted material. The metal has a long implant history, from neuroscience, vascular medicine, radiography, orthopaedics, prosthodontics, and various other fields, primarily as a result of its high density, radiopacity, tensile strength, and yield point. However, a crucial material criterion for chronically implanted metals is their long-term resistance to corrosion in body fluids, either by inherently noble metallic surfaces, or by protective passivation layers of metal oxide. The latter is often assumed for elemental tungsten, with references to its 'inertness' and 'stability' common in the literature. This review argues that in the body, metallic tungsten fails this criterion, and will eventually dissolve into the soluble hexavalent form W6+, typically represented by the orthotungstate [Formula: see text] (monomeric tungstate) anion. This paper outlines the metal's unfavourable corrosion thermodynamics in the human physiological environment, the chemical pathways to either metallic or metal oxide dissolution, the rate-limiting steps, and the corrosion-accelerating effects of reactive oxidising species that the immune system produces post-implantation. Multiple examples of implant corrosion have been reported, with failure by dissolution to varying extents up to total loss, with associated emission of tungstate ions and elevated blood serum levels measured. The possible toxicity of these corrosion products has also been explored. As the field of medical implants grows and designers explore novel solutions to medical implant problems, the authors recommend the use of alternative materials.",29300000,2018,The use of tungsten as a chronically implanted material.
254,"BACKGROUND
Although oral health has improved remarkably in recent decades, not all populations have benefited equally. Ethnic identity, and in particular visible minority status, has been identified as an important risk factor for poor oral health. Canadian research on ethnic disparities in oral health is extremely limited. The aim of this study was to examine ethnic disparities in oral health outcomes and to assess the extent to which ethnic disparities could be accounted for by demographic, socioeconomic and caries-related behavioral factors, among a population-based sample of grade 1 and 2 schoolchildren (age range: 5-8 years) in Alberta, Canada.


METHODS
A dental survey (administered during 2013-14) included a mouth examination and parent questionnaire. Oral health outcomes included: 1) percentage of children with dental caries; 2) number of decayed, extracted/missing (due to caries) and filled teeth; 3) percentage of children with two or more teeth with untreated caries; and 4) percentage of children with parental-ratings of fair or poor oral health. We used multivariable regression analysis to examine ethnic disparities in oral health, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and caries-related behavioral variables.


RESULTS
We observed significant ethnic disparities in children's oral health. Most visible minority groups, particularly Filipino and Arab, as well as Indigenous children, were more likely to have worse oral health than White populations. In particular, Filipino children had an almost 5-fold higher odds of having severe untreated dental problems (2 or more teeth with untreated caries) than White children. Adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and caries-related behavior variables attenuated but did not eliminate ethnic disparities in oral health, with the exception of Latin American children whose outcomes did not differ significantly from White populations after adjustment.

Significant ethnic disparities in oral health exist in Alberta, Canada, even when adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and caries-related behavioral factors, with Filipino, Arab, and Indigenous children being the most affected.",29301577,2018,"Ethnic disparities in children's oral health: findings from a population-based survey of grade 1 and 2 schoolchildren in Alberta, Canada."
255,"OBJECTIVE
Demyelination that results from disease or traumatic injury, such as spinal cord injury (SCI), can have a devastating effect on neural function and recovery. Many researchers are examining treatments to minimize demyelination by improving oligodendrocyte availability in vivo. Transplantation of stem and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells is a promising option, however, trials are plagued by undirected differentiation. Here we introduce a biomaterial that has been optimized to direct the differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) toward oligodendrocytes as a cell delivery vehicle after SCI.


APPROACH
A collagen-based hydrogel was modified to mimic the mechanical properties of the neonatal spinal cord, and components present in the developing extracellular matrix were included to provide appropriate chemical cues to the NPCs to direct their differentiation toward oligodendrocytes. The hydrogel with cells was then transplanted into a unilateral cervical contusion model of SCI to examine the functional recovery with this treatment. Six behavioral tests and histological assessment were performed to examine the in vivo response to this treatment.


MAIN RESULTS
Our results demonstrate that we can achieve a significant increase in oligodendrocyte differentiation of NPCs compared to standard culture conditions using a three-component biomaterial composed of collagen, hyaluronic acid, and laminin that has mechanical properties matched to those of neonatal neural tissue. Additionally, SCI rats with hydrogel transplants, with and without NPCs, showed functional recovery. Animals transplanted with hydrogels with NPCs showed significantly increased functional recovery over six weeks compared to the media control group.

259,"Amino-modified magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by direct chemisorption of biocompatible d,l-lysine (DLL) on electrostatically stabilized magnetic nanoparticles with the aim to bind specific antibodies (Ab) able to detect cancer cells. The magnetic nanoparticles prepared by coprecipitation were stabilized in an acidic medium. A full optimization study of amino modification performed by UV/Vis spectroscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering measurement (DLS) confirmed an optimal DLL/Fe3O4 weight ratio of 2. The sample was subjected to complex characterizations using different techniques such as UV/Vis, FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) together with transmission electron microscopy and size/zeta potential measurements. While FTIR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy and XPS confirmed the successful amino modification of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, a characterization using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) indicated superparamagnetic behavior in all the prepared samples, suggesting that the coating process did not significantly affect the size and structure of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles with the optimal DLL content were conjugated with the M75 monoclonal antibody specific to carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), which is considered one of the best markers of tumor hypoxia and a prognostic indicator of cancer progression. The results demonstrate that all tested cell lines survived and even proliferated in the presence of amino-modified magnetic nanoparticles. Even the tubulin cytoskeletal structure was not disrupted after the exposure of cells to surface-modified magnetic nanoparticles. In contrast, internalization of the antibody-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles led to abrogation of the formation of long and extended microtubules. Finally, the finding supports the view that the M75 antibody conjugated to nanoparticles mediates their specific uptake and intracellular accumulation and that the antibody conjugated magnetic nanoparticles can be potentially used for the selective growth inhibition of CA IX-expressing cells.",29306846,2018,"d,l-lysine functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles for detection of cancer cells."

In wild and BCRP KO mice CHF6001 was not detectable in brain, whereas it was measurable in Mdr1a/b KO mice. Therefore, in animal species Mdr1a/b plays a significant role in CHF6001 disposition, limiting its distribution into brain and contributing to the safety profile observed in preclinical evaluation.

An integral component in the assessment of vocal behavior in groups of freely interacting animals is the ability to determine which animal is producing each vocal signal. This process is facilitated by using microphone arrays with multiple channels.


NEW METHOD AND COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
Here, we made important refinements to a state-of-the-art microphone array based system used to localize vocal signals produced by freely interacting laboratory mice. Key changes to the system included increasing the number of microphones as well as refining the methodology for localizing and assigning vocal signals to individual mice.


RESULTS
We systematically demonstrate that the improvements in the methodology for localizing mouse vocal signals led to an increase in the number of signals detected as well as the number of signals accurately assigned to an animal.


CONCLUSIONS
These changes facilitated the acquisition of larger and more comprehensive data sets that better represent the vocal activity within an experiment. Furthermore, this system will allow more thorough analyses of the role that vocal signals play in social communication.

The transition to college is associated with weight gain, but the relation between eating behavior indicators and anthropometric outcomes during this period remains unclear.


OBJECTIVE
Evaluate sex differences in stress, emotional eating, tendency to overeat, and restrained eating behavior, and determine whether the psycho-behavioral constructs assessed immediately prior to starting college are associated with anthropometry and adiposity at the start of college, and with first-semester weight gain.


METHODS
A prospective study administered the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), Satter Eating Competence Inventory, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to 264 participants one month before college. Body composition was assessed via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the start of college, and anthropometry (weight, height, waist circumference[WC]) was collected at the beginning and end of the first semester. Ordinary least squares regression tested the cross-sectional association of baseline psychological and behavioral scales with baseline DXA and anthropometry, and the longitudinal association with change in anthropometry.

Among 264 participants, 91% (241) had baseline data, and 66% (173) completed follow-up. In sex-adjusted linear regression models, baseline TFEQ disinhibited and emotional (DE; EE) eating sub-scales were positively associated with baseline weight (P = .003; DE, P = .014; EE), body mass index (BMI, P = .002; DE, P = .001; EE), WC (P = .004; DE, P = .006; EE) and DXA fat mass index (P = .023; DE, P = .014; EE). Baseline PSS was positively associated with subsequent changes in weight and WC among males only (weight Pinteraction = 0.0268; WC Pinteraction = 0.0017).


CONCLUSION
College freshmen with questionnaire scores indicating a greater tendency to overeat in response to external cues and emotions tended to have greater weight, BMI, and WC at the start of college. Males with higher perceived stress at college entrance subsequently gained significantly more weight in the first semester, but no such relation was evident in females.",29309851,2018,Stress and psychological constructs related to eating behavior are associated with anthropometry and body composition in young adults.
263,"Chronic stress is associated with palatable food intake and thus, the development of obesity. This may be due to chronic stress disrupting the regulatory effects of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis on stress-induced eating. Thus, the primary objective of the current study was to investigate how chronic stress (CS) and cortisol stress reactivity affect eating behaviors following acute stress. Exploratory analyses also sought to determine the distinct psychophysiological factors driving acute stress-induced eating in women with high versus low CS. Women with high (n = 21) and low (n = 14) perceived CS were subjected to the Trier Social Stress task and a rest period on two separate days in order to assess HPA axis and subjective psychological responses to acute stress. Following either stress or rest, participants portioned and consumed snack foods. Women displaying high cortisol reactivity to acute stress ate a smaller percentage of the food they poured than low cortisol reactors, but only in the low CS group. Additionally, stress-induced eating behaviors were associated with cortisol stress reactivity, depressive symptoms, and hunger for women with low CS, but only with a reduction in negative affect for women with high CS. Results indicated that chronic stress may disrupt HPA axis regulation of acute stress-induced consummatory behavior in favor of affective regulation. Replication in women across the weight spectrum may yield a greater understanding of how chronic stress affects the mechanisms underlying acute stress-induced eating, and inform prevention and treatment efforts for conditions related to stress and obesity.",29309852,2018,The impact of chronic stress on the predictors of acute stress-induced eating in women.
264,"INTRODUCTION
Due to the high candidate exclusion rate during a drug development process, an early prediction of the pharmacokinetic behavior would be needed. Accordingly, high performance bioaffinity chromatography (HPBAC) approaches are growing in popularity, however, there is a lack of knowledge and no consensus about the relation between HPBAC measurements, in vivo distribution and blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration behavior. With respect to radiotracers, there is almost no reference data available for plasma protein binding (PPB), permeability (Pm) and the membrane coefficient (KIAM). Thus, this study was aimed at exploring the relevance of measuring PPB, Pm and KIAM for the prediction of BBB penetration.


METHODS
Measurements of %PPB, Pm and KIAM were performed using HPBAC. In total, 113 compounds were tested, 43 with brain uptake, 30 not showing brain uptake and 40 with known interactions with efflux transporters. Additionally, ClogP and HPLC logPowpH7.4 data were collected.


RESULTS
%PPB, KIAM, Pm and ClogP values were in the same range for each of the three groups. A significant difference was observed for the HPLC logPowpH7.4 between CNS penetrating drug group (CNSpos) and the non-penetrating drug group (CNSneg), as well as for the CNSneg towards the drug group interacting with efflux transporters (DRUGefflux). However, as the other experimental data, also the HPLC logPowpH7.4 showed a broad overlapping of the single values between the groupings.


CONCLUSION
Experimental reference values (logP, Pm, KIAM & PPB) of commonly used PET tracers and drugs showing different BBB penetration behavior are provided. The influence of the logP on brain uptake depends strongly on the selected method. However, using a single parameter (experimental or calculated) to predict BBB penetration or for the classification of drug groups is inexpedient.",29309919,2018,Expanding LogP: Present possibilities.
265,"RATIONALE
Clinical studies have shown that some psychoactive recreational drugs have therapeutic applications in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, to date, there are few studies on the therapeutic potential efficacy of recreational drugs in compulsive neuropsychiatric disorders.


OBJECTIVES
We explored the therapeutic potential of different psychoactive and psychedelic drugs in a preclinical model of compulsive behavior.


METHODS
Outbred male Wistar rats were selected as either high (HD) or low (LD) drinkers according to their behavior in schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP). Subsequently, we assessed the effects of acute administration of scopolamine (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (0.25, 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg), ketamine (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg), cannabidiol (1 and 3 mg/kg), WIN21255-2 (0.5, 075, and 1 mg/kg), and AM404 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) on compulsive drinking in SIP.


RESULTS
Scopolamine reduced dose-dependent compulsive drinking in HD compared with LD rats in SIP. Methamphetamine induced a dose-dependent inverted U-curve effect in both groups, in which lower doses increased and higher doses reduced compulsive drinking in SIP. Ketamine, cannabidiol, WIN21255-2, and AM404 did not have any relevant effects in SIP.


CONCLUSIONS
These data provide new evidence that low doses of scopolamine and intermediate doses of methamphetamine might therapeutically reduce compulsive behaviors and suggest that there is not a direct participation of the endocannabinoid system in compulsive behavior on SIP. The research in the underlying neurochemical mechanisms of these psychoactive drugs might provide an additional insight on new therapeutic targets in compulsive neuropsychiatric disorders.",29313138,2018,Do psychoactive drugs have a therapeutic role in compulsivity?

266,"The ballistic ejection of liquid drops by electrostatic manipulating has both fundamental and practical implications, from raindrops in thunderclouds to self-cleaning, anti-icing, condensation, and heat transfer enhancements. In this paper, the ballistic jumping behavior of liquid drops from a superhydrophobic surface is investigated. Powered by the repulsion of the same kind of charges, water drops can jump from the surface. The electrostatic acting time for the jumping of a microliter supercooled drop only takes several milliseconds, even shorter than the time for icing. In addition, one can control the ballistic jumping direction precisely by the relative position above the electrostatic field. The approach offers a facile method that can be used to manipulate the ballistic drop jumping via an electrostatic field, opening the possibility of energy efficient drop detaching techniques in various applications.",29315840,2018,Ballistic Jumping Drops on Superhydrophobic Surfaces via Electrostatic Manipulation.
267,"Adolescence has been referred to as the last best chance to prevent adult non-communicable diseases. Gaining further evidence on the psychosocial determinants of health behaviors, particularly the impact of peers, social networks and media on diet, is necessary to develop appropriate preventive strategies. Based on a multiple-cases study, our aim was to discuss the social influences on adolescents' dietary behavior from a social capital perspective. Participants were reached through four high-schools in different Catalan rural-urban and socioeconomic contexts. Our results confirm the different layout of social capital in the community, school, peers and family. In our sample, family and peers are the most influent sources of social capital in relation to dietary behaviors, inducing both protective and damaging effects.",29317272,2018,"Social influences on adolescents' dietary behavior in Catalonia, Spain: A qualitative multiple-cases study from the perspective of social capital."
268,"The literature has long emphasized the role of higher cortical structures in endogenous orienting. Based on evolutionary explanation and previous data, we explored the possibility that lower monocular channels may also have a functional role in endogenous orienting of attention. Sensitive behavioral manipulation was used to probe the contribution of monocularly segregated regions in a simple cue - target detection task. A central spatially informative cue, and its ensuing target, were presented to the same or different eyes at varying cue-target intervals. Results indicated that the onset of endogenous orienting was apparent earlier when the cue and target were presented to the same eye. The data provides converging evidence for the notion that endogenous facilitation is modulated by monocular portions of the visual stream. This, in turn, suggests that higher cortical mechanisms are not exclusively responsible for endogenous orienting, and that a dynamic interaction between higher and lower neural levels, might be involved.",29317323,2018,Monocular channels have a functional role in endogenous orienting.
269,"A facile method to convert biomolecule-based carbon nanodots (CNDs) into high-surface-area 3D-graphene networks with excellent electrochemical properties is presented. Initially, CNDs are synthesized by microwave-assisted thermolysis of citric acid and urea according to previously published protocols. Next, the CNDs are annealed up to 400 °C in a tube furnace in an oxygen-free environment. Finally, films of the thermolyzed CNDs are converted into open porous 3D turbostratic graphene (3D-ts-graphene) networks by irradiation with an infrared laser. Based upon characterizations using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, a feasible reaction mechanism for both the thermolysis of the CNDs and the subsequent laser conversion into 3D-ts-graphene is presented. The 3D-ts-graphene networks show excellent morphological properties, such as a hierarchical porous structure and a high surface area, as well as promising electrochemical properties. For example, nearly ideal capacitive behavior with a volumetric capacitance of 27.5 mF L-1 is achieved at a current density of 560 A L-1 , which corresponds to an energy density of 24.1 mWh L-1 at a power density of 711 W L-1 .

270,"The biomimetic characteristics of the memristor as an electronic synapse and neuron have inspired the advent of new information technology in the neuromorphic computing. The application of the memristors can be extended to the artificial nerves on condition of the presence of electronic receptors which can transfer the external stimuli to the internal nerve system. In this work, nociceptor behaviors are demonstrated from the Pt/HfO2 /TiN memristor for the electronic receptors. The device shows four specific nociceptive behaviors; threshold, relaxation, allodynia, and hyperalgesia, according to the strength, duration, and repetition rate of the external stimuli. Such nociceptive behaviors are attributed to the electron trapping/detrapping to/from the traps in the HfO2 layer, where the depth of trap energy level is ≈0.7 eV. Also, the built-in potential by the work function mismatch between the Pt and TiN electrodes induces time-dependent relaxation of trapped electrons, providing the appropriate relaxation behavior. The relaxation time can take from several milliseconds to tens of seconds, which corresponds to the time span of the decay of biosignal. The material-wise evaluation of the electronic nociceptor in comparison with other material, which did not show the desired functionality, Pt/Ti/HfO2 /TiN, reveals the importance of careful material design and fabrication.",29318678,2018,Nociceptive Memristor.
271,"Utilizing magnetic field directly modulating/turning the charge carrier transport behavior of field-effect transistor (FET) at ambient conditions is an enormous challenge in the field of micro-nanoelectronics. Here, a new type of magnetic-induced-piezopotential gated field-effect-transistor (MIPG-FET) base on laminate composites is proposed, which consists of Terfenol-D, a ferroelectric single crystal (PMNPT), and MoS2 flake. When applying an external magnetic field to the MIPG-FET, the piezopotential of PMNPT triggered by magnetostriction of the Terfenol-D can serve as the gate voltage to effectively modulate/control the carrier transport process and the corresponding drain current at room temperature. Considering the two polarization states of PMNPT, the drain current is diminished from 9.56 to 2.9 µA in the Pup state under a magnetic field of 33 mT, and increases from 1.41 to 4.93 µA in the Pdown state under a magnetic field of 42 mT and at a drain voltage of 3 V. The current on/off ratios in these states are 330% and 432%, respectively.

272,"Binge alcohol-drinking elicits symptoms of negative affect such as anxiety upon cessation, which is a source of negative reinforcement for perpetuating this pattern of alcohol abuse. Binge-induced anxiety during early (24 h) withdrawal is associated with increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) within the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) of adult male mice, but was unchanged in anxiety-resilient adolescents. Herein, we determined the role of mGlu5 signaling in withdrawal-induced anxiety via pharmacological manipulation using the mGlu5 negative allosteric modulator MTEP and the positive allosteric modulator CDPPB. Adult (PND 56) and adolescent (PND 28) male C57BL/6J mice binge-drank for 14 days under 3-bottle-choice procedures for 2 h/day; control animals drank water only. Approximately 24 h following the final alcohol presentation, animals were treated with 30 mg/kg IP MTEP, CDPPB, or vehicle and then tested, thirty minutes later, for behavioral signs of anxiety. Vehicle-treated binge-drinking adults exhibited hyperanxiety in all paradigms, while vehicle-treated binge-drinking adolescents did not exhibit withdrawal-induced anxiety. In adults, 30 mg/kg MTEP decreased alcohol-induced anxiety across paradigms, while 3 mg/kg MTEP was anxiolytic in adult water controls. CDPPB was modestly anxiogenic in both alcohol- and water-drinking mice. Adolescent animals showed minimal response to either CDPPB or MTEP, suggesting that anxiety in adolescence may be mGlu5-independent. These results demonstrate a causal role for mGlu5 in withdrawal-induced anxiety in adults and suggest age-related differences in the behavioral pharmacology of the negative reinforcing properties of alcohol.",29324247,2018,mGlu5-dependent modulation of anxiety during early withdrawal from binge-drinking in adult and adolescent male mice.
273,"AIM
Our aim was to compare physician-reported barriers to sublingual buprenorphine (BUP) and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NLT) prescribing in U.S. office-based practices, and to identify potential policies for minimizing these barriers. Only one previous qualitative study has examined physician-reported barriers to prescribing XR-NLT and no qualitative study has compared physician-reported barriers between the two medications.


METHODS
Researchers conducted individual semi-structured and in-depth interviews with 20 licensed physicians in four U.S. states between January 2016 and May 2017. Interview questions included general barriers to addiction treatment in office-based settings, barriers specific to BUP and XR-NLT prescribing, and potential government policies to decrease barriers. Researchers conducted thematic analysis of transcribed interviews. They developed and pilot tested a coding template based on a sample of transcripts, independently coded transcripts in Dedoose software, conducted consensus coding to eliminate coding discrepancies, and then assessed data for themes using research questions as a guide.


RESULTS
General barriers to office-based OUD treatment included limited physician education, limited insurance reimbursement, stigma, and perceptions of ""difficult"" patients. Barriers specific to BUP prescribing included regulatory restrictions, liability fears, and restrictions imposed by the criminal justice system. Barriers specific to XR-NLT prescribing included limited access to medically-supervised opioid detoxification, lack of awareness of the medication, and patient fears or disinterest. Participants without experience prescribing either medication emphasized barriers to treating OUD in general. Participants with experience prescribing BUP and/or XR-NLT described barriers to treating OUD in general as well as barriers specific to each medication. Policy makers should increase access to addiction medicine education, mandate insurance coverage of both medications and inpatient detoxification, prohibit excessive insurance prior authorization requirements, increase insurance reimbursement for behavioral healthcare, and incentivize interdisciplinary collaboration.


CONCLUSIONS
While overlap exists, some barriers to BUP prescribing differ from barriers to XR-NLT prescribing.",29324253,2018,A qualitative study comparing physician-reported barriers to treating addiction using buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone in U.S. office-based practices.
274,"BACKGROUND
The advisability of performing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for patients with indeterminate colitis is debated. Indeterminate colitis is found in up to 15% of inflammatory bowel disease colectomy specimens. We determined long-term outcomes in patients diagnosed with indeterminate colitis undergoing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.


METHODS
Fifty-six patients were included with a mean follow-up of 14 ± 7 years. Long-term behavior was defined based on surgeon assessment as ""Crohn disease-like"" in patients who subsequently developed clear signs of Crohn disease and as ""non-Crohn disease-like."" Long-term function was assessed using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life and Pouch Functional Score.


RESULTS
Thirty-nine percent of patients developed Crohn disease-like behavior, and 61% developed non-Crohn disease-like behavior. Both groups experienced a high rate of pouchitis (57%). Crohn disease-like patients required more anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory medications (95% vs 18%, P < .001), dilatations for afferent-limb strictures (41% vs 0%, P < .001), and pouch reoperations (32% vs 6%, P = .02). Eight patients required pouch excision or diversion (7 with Crohn disease-like behavior). The Pouch Functional Score was equivalent between groups.


CONCLUSION
Long-term function after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for the majority of indeterminate colitis patients was good. Approximately 40% eventually exhibited Crohn disease-like behavior, but the majority had acceptable function and quality of life. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is an appropriate surgical option for indeterminate colitis patients after informed consent.",29325789,2018,Long-term outcomes following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with indeterminate colitis.
275,"Dietary patterns play key roles in health promotion and in preserving the environment. A growing number of studies show the importance of individual factors on food consumption choices, such as socio-economic status, lifestyle variables and contextual and social factors that characterize the geographical area in which individuals reside. The Mediterranean Diet is a sustainable diet that respects the environment, thus reducing per capita emissions from food production in respect to less sustainable diet. The aim of this paper is to determine the Italians' prevailing food patterns using a composite indicator and to identify which factors determine a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in Italy. By using 15 waves of the ISTAT ""Aspect of Daily Life"" survey, we constructed an original data set and referred to the multilevel approach which enabled us to distinguish between temporal and cross-sectional effects thus providing valuable insights to policy makers and stakeholders in order to promote the Mediterranean Diet and reap environmental and public health. The results show that education plays an important role in determining food consumption behavior while the tendency to practice sports on a regular basis and to have breakfast and lunch at home positively influence people's adherence to this diet.",29330002,2018,Choosing a healthy and sustainable diet: A three-level approach for understanding the drivers of the Italians' dietary regime over time.
276,"Aberrations in eating patterns constitute a substantial public health burden. Computer-based paradigms that measure responses to images of foods are potentially useful tools for assessing food attitudes and characteristics of eating behavior. In particular, food choice tasks attempt to directly probe aspects of individuals' decisions about what to eat. In the Food Choice Task participants rate the healthiness and tastiness of a variety of food items presented one at a time. Next, participants choose for each food item whether they prefer to eat the item vs. a neutrally rated reference food item. The goal of the current study was to assess the stability and reliability of this Food Choice Task over time and with repeated testing. Secondary analyses were conducted using data from healthy volunteers in two separate studies that administered the task at two time points, separated either by several days or about a month. The overall reliability of the Food Choice Task across multiple administrations was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients and the reliability of ratings of individual food items was assessed using kappa coefficients. The results indicated that test-retest reliability of the Food Choice Task in healthy volunteers was high at both shorter and longer test-retest intervals. In addition, the reliability of individual food item ratings was good for a majority of items. The proportion of healthy volunteers' high-fat food choices did not change over time in either of the two studies. Thus, the Food Choice Task is suitable for measuring food choices in studies with multiple assessment points. In particular, the task may be well suited to assess restrictive eating, a construct which it has been difficult to assess in experimental settings.",29331365,2018,Assessment of test-retest reliability of a food choice task among healthy individuals.
277,"Eating beyond physiological need contributes to obesity onset. Measuring this behavior could help identify those at risk for weight gain. This study measured eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) and its relationship with weight change and self-report measures related to appetite and eating behavior. EAH was assessed in 46 lean young women (69% pre-selected for weight gain proneness) after lunch and defined as the number of calories subsequently consumed from snacks. Participants also completed questionnaires, and their body weights were measured regularly over the next year. Participants consumed a mean 188 calories (±140) during the EAH test. Caloric intake during the EAH test was associated with hedonic hunger (p < .01, R2 = 0.18), loss of control eating (p < .001, R2 = 0.29), and weight gain over two months (p < .01, R2 = 0.19), controlling for baseline body mass index. All were large effect sizes. In contrast, EAH was unrelated to emotional eating, disinhibition, and longer-term weight change. Amount of the test meal eaten in a hungry state was unrelated to these variables. While EAH has mainly been examined in children, these results expand its utility to adults. EAH seems to reflect naturalistic eating behavior, as shown by its relationship with short-term weight gain, drive to overconsume foods, and loss of control over eating. EAH may be a useful test to identify young adults at risk for weight gain and/or disordered eating, and may be a target for intervention.",29331366,2018,"Eating in the absence of hunger is related to loss-of-control eating, hedonic hunger, and short-term weight gain in normal-weight women."

We systemically assessed the prognostic value and whether TS associated with malignant progression in PDA. Protein and mRNA expression level of TS were evaluated in en bloc PDA samples, the prognostic effect of TS expressed in cytoplasm or cytonuclear was determined separately in the first time. The impact of TS on tumor cell behaviors was assessed in in vitro assays, and the TS associated metastatic potential was further determined in two different PDA metastatic models. The retrospective clinical analysis firstly demonstrated that tumor cytonuclear TS expression was positively correlated with lymphatic metastasis and negatively correlated with the overall survival (OS) in PDA patients. The subsequent experiments further confirmed that TS depletion can effectively abate EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal) process in in vitro and decline most of the metastatic lesions in two different PDA mice models, and the deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) biosynthesis malfunction resulted imbalanced dNTP pools may be the fundamental causation. Collectively, the present study suggested the prospective strategy of combined anti-TS scheme for metastatic PDA, and we strongly suggest further clinical standardization research with a large cohort to verify the prognostic value and the therapeutic potential of TS in PDA.",29331423,2018,Thymidylate synthase prompts metastatic progression through the dTMP associated EMT process in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
279,"The reliable detection of estrus is an important scientific and practical challenge in dairy cattle farming. Female vocalization may indicate reproductive status, and preliminary evidence suggests that this information can be used to detect estrus in dairy cattle. The aim of this study was to associate the changes in the vocalization rate of dairy heifers with behavioral estrus indicators as well as test the influence of the type of estrus (natural estrus vs. superovulation-induced estrus). We analyzed 6 predefined estrus-related behavior patterns (standing to be mounted, head-side mounting, active mounting, chin resting, being mounted while not standing, and active sniffing in the anogenital region) and vocalization rates in the peri-estrus period (day of estrus ± 1 d) of 12 German Holstein heifers using audio-visual recordings. Each heifer was observed under natural estrus and a consecutive superovulation induced by FSH and cloprostenol. Estrus was determined by behavioral patterns and confirmed by clinical examination (vaginoscopy and ultrasound imaging of the ovaries) as well as by the concentration of peripheral progesterone. Estrus behavior and vocalization rates were analyzed in 3-h intervals (an average of 19 intervals for each heifer), and an estrus score was calculated based on the 6 behaviors. The interval with the highest estrus score (I0) was considered the estrus climax. We demonstrated similar time courses for the estrus score and vocalization rate independent of estrus type. However, in natural estrus, the maximum vocalization rate (±SE) occurred in the interval before estrus climax (I-1; 42.58 ± 21.89) and was significantly higher than that in any other interval except estrus climax (I0; 27.58 ± 9.76). During natural estrus, the vocalization rate was significantly higher within the interval before estrus climax (I-1; 42.58 ± 21.89 vs. 11.58 ± 5.51) than under superovulation. The results underscore the potential use of vocalization rate as a suitable indicator of estrus climax in automated estrus detection devices.

280,"Drug candidate LPSF/FZ4 with promising schistosomicidal properties in vitro was previously synthesized. However, LPSF/FZ4 has limited aqueous solubility (<1 μg/mL), leading to ineffective dissolution and, therefore, no meaningful in vivo comparative studies could be pursued. This study was aimed to develop a proper amorphous solid dispersion (SD) to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate of LPSF/FZ4 such that its biological activity could be investigated. To better understand its physiological behavior, the pKa of LPSF/FZ4, a monoprotic weak acid with NH group at the imidazolidine ring, was first determined to be 8.13 using an automated SiriusT3. The development of SD systems for LPSF/FZ4 involved the evaluation of various water-soluble polymer carriers such as PVP K-29/32, PVP K-90, HPMC K4M, PVPVA 64 and SOLUPLUS®. The most promising SD systems were selected through in vitro dissolution studies under nonsink conditions, together with physicochemical characterization as well as accelerated stability study. It was shown that SD of 10% LPSF/FZ4 in SOLUPLUS® and PVP K-90 could significantly increase the area-under-the-curve value of the nonsink dissolution profile (AUC values of the SD in SOLUPLUS® and PVP K-90 were 1381.03 and 1342.34 μL/mL·min, respectively, and that of the pure crystalline drug was 0.02 μL/mL·min), a useful surrogate for the in vivo bioavailability. Cmax values for the SD in SOLUPLUS® (12.50 μL/mL) and PVP K-90 (25.86 μL/mL) were also higher than the one of the crystalline drug (0.02 μL/mL). The SD system of LPSF/FZ4 in SOLUPLUS® showed a significant increase in schistosomicidal activity in an animal model as compared with the conventional treatment using crystalline drug, consistent with the AUC trend from the nonsink dissolution. Thus this SD system of LPSF/FZ4 could be useful as a potential formulation for treating schistosomiasis.",29331607,2018,Solid dispersions to enhance the delivery of a potential drug candidate LPSF/FZ4 for the treatment of schistosomiasis.
281,"Burying beetles (Nicrophorus sp.) are necrophagous insects with developed parental care. Genome of Nicrophorus vespilloides has been recently sequenced, which makes them interesting model organism in behavioral ecology. However, we know very little about their physiology, including the functioning of their neuroendocrine system. In this study, one of the physiological activities of proctolin, myosuppressin (Nicve-MS), myoinhibitory peptide (Trica-MIP-5) and the short neuropeptide F (Nicve-sNPF) in N. vespilloides have been investigated. The tested neuropeptides were myoactive on N. vespilloides hindgut. After application of the proctolin increased hindgut contraction frequency was observed (EC50 value was 5.47 × 10-8 mol/L). The other tested neuropeptides led to inhibition of N. vespilloides hindgut contractions (Nicve-MS: IC50 = 5.20 × 10-5 mol/L; Trica-MIP-5: IC50 = 5.95 × 10-6 mol/L; Nicve-sNPF: IC50 = 4.08 × 10-5 mol/L). Moreover, the tested neuropeptides were immunolocalized in the nervous system of N. vespilloides. Neurons containing sNPF and MIP in brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC) were identified. Proctolin-immunolabeled neurons only in VNC were observed. Moreover, MIP-immunolabeled varicosities and fibers in retrocerebral complex were observed. In addition, our results have been supplemented with alignments of amino acid sequences of these neuropeptides in beetle species. This alignment analysis clearly showed amino acid sequence similarities between neuropeptides. Moreover, this allowed to deduce amino acid sequence of N. vespilloides proctolin (RYLPTa), Nicve-MS (QDVDHVFLRFa) and six isoforms of Nicve-MIP (Nicve-MIP-1-DWNRNLHSWa; Nicve-MIP-2-AWQNLQGGWa; Nicve-MIP-3-AWQNLQGGWa; Nicve-MIP-4-AWKNLNNAGWa; Nicve-MIP-5-SEWGNFRGSWa; Nicve-MIP-6- DPAWTNLKGIWa; and Nicve-sNPF-SGRSPSLRLRFa).",29333681,2018,Myotropic activity and immunolocalization of selected neuropeptides of the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides (Coleoptera: Silphidae).
282,"In a verbal fluency task, a person is required to produce as many exemplars of a given category (e.g., 'animals', or words starting with 'f') as possible within a fixed duration. Successful verbal fluency performance relies both on the depth of search within semantic/phonological neighborhoods ('clustering') and the ability to flexibly disengage between exhausted clusters ('switching'). Convergent evidence from functional imaging and neuropsychology suggests that cluster-switch behaviors engage dissociable brain regions. Switching has been linked to a frontoparietal network dedicated to executive functioning and controlled lexical retrieval, whereas clustering is more commonly associated with temporal lobe regions dedicated to semantic and phonological processing. Here we attempted to modulate cluster-switch dynamics among neurotypical adults (N = 24) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) delivered at three sites: a) anterior temporal cortex; b) frontal cortex; and c) temporoparietal cortex. Participants completed letter-guided and semantic category verbal fluency tasks pre/post stimulation.

283,"Visible light has risen to become a very important facilitator for selective radical reactions enabled by well-cognized photocatalysts. The renaissance of visible-light photocatalysis on this matter partly relies on integrating it with other fields of catalysis. In parallel, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin N-oxide (TEMPO), a quintessential persistent radical, has a wide range of uses owing to its exceptional redox behavior, which gives rise to its latest prominence in catalysis. Therefore, integrating the catalysis of TEMPO with photocatalysis to perform visible-light-induced selective reactions becomes a very convenient marriage of merits. In this context, the integration of different types of photocatalysts, including metal complexes, metal-free organic dyes, and semiconductors, with TEMPO for outstanding organic transformations will be summarized. To expand further the catalytic repertoire, the integration of TEMPOH analogues such as NHPI (N-hydroxyphthalimide) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) with photocatalysis will also be discussed. Hopefully, these advances will pave the way for more breakthroughs by integrating TEMPO and its analogues with photocatalysis to lead to a valuable blueprint for visible-light-induced selective organic transformations.",29337436,2018,Integrating TEMPO and Its Analogues with Visible-Light Photocatalysis.
284,"Mast cell tumor (MCT) is a frequent cutaneous neoplasm in dogs that is heterogeneous in clinical presentation and biological behavior, with a variable potential for recurrence and metastasis. Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes has been challenging. The study objective was to develop a system for classification of canine MCT according to the mortality risk based on individual assessment of clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features. The study included 149 dogs with a histologic diagnosis of cutaneous or subcutaneous MCT. By univariate analysis, MCT metastasis and related death was significantly associated with clinical stage ( P < .0001, rP = -0.610), history of tumor recurrence ( P < .0001, rP = -0.550), Patnaik ( P < .0001, rP = -0.380) and Kiupel grades ( P < .0001, rP = -0.500), predominant organization of neoplastic cells ( P < .0001, rP = -0.452), mitotic count ( P < .0001, rP = -0.325), Ki-67 labeling index ( P < .0001, rP = -0.414), KITr pattern ( P = .02, rP = 0.207), and c-KIT mutational status ( P < .0001, rP = -0.356). By multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazard model, only 2 features were independent predictors of overall survival: an amendment of the World Health Organization clinical staging system (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 1.824 [1.210-4.481]; P = .01) and a history of tumor recurrence (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 9.250 [2.158-23.268]; P < .001]. From these results, we propose an amendment of the WHO staging system, a method of risk analysis, and a suggested approach to clinical and laboratory evaluation of dogs with cutaneous MCT.",29338615,2018,"Assessment of Canine Mast Cell Tumor Mortality Risk Based on Clinical, Histologic, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Features."
285,"Commonalities in addictive behavior, such as craving, stimuli-driven drug seeking, and a high propensity for relapse following abstinence, have pushed for a unified theory of addiction that encompasses most abused substances. This unitary theory has recently been challenged - citing distinctions in structural neural plasticity, biochemical signaling, and neural circuitry to argue that addiction to opioids and psychostimulants is behaviorally and neurobiologically distinct. Recent more selective examination of drug-induced plasticity has highlighted that these two drug classes promote an overall reward circuitry signaling overlap through modifying excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens - a key constituent of the reward system. We discuss adaptations in presynaptic/postsynaptic and extrasynaptic glutamate signaling produced by opioids and psychostimulants, and their relevance to circuit remodeling and addiction-related behavior - arguing that these core neural adaptations are important targets for developing pharmacotherapies to treat addiction to multiple drugs.",29338873,2018,Opioid and Psychostimulant Plasticity: Targeting Overlap in Nucleus Accumbens Glutamate Signaling.
286,"INTRODUCTION
Women from lower-income backgrounds have the highest rates of obesity. Thus, effective programs for this high-risk population are urgently needed. Evidence suggests that adding financial incentives to treatment helps to engage and promote health behavior change in lower-income populations; however, this has never been tested in women for obesity treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether adding small financial incentives to Internet weight loss treatment yields better weight loss outcomes in women from lower-income backgrounds compared with the same treatment without incentives. Weight losses in lower-versus higher-income women were also compared.


METHODS
Data were pooled from two randomized trials in which women (N=264) received either Internet behavioral weight loss treatment (IBWL) or IBWL plus incentives (IBWL+$). Weight was objectively assessed. Data were collected and analyzed from 2011 to 2017.


RESULTS
Women from lower-income backgrounds had significantly better weight loss outcomes in IBWL+$ compared with IBWL alone (6.4 [SD=4.9%] vs 2.6 [SD=4.6%], p=0.01). Moreover, a greater percentage achieved a ≥5% weight loss in IBWL+$ vs IBWL alone (52.6% vs 38.1%, p=0.01). Interestingly, the comparison between lower-income versus higher-income groups showed that, in IBWL alone, women with lower income achieved significantly poorer weight losses (3.4 [SD=4.2%] vs 4.9 [SD=4.0%], p=0.03). By contrast, in IBWL+$, weight loss outcomes did not differ by income status (5.0 [SD=5.6%] vs 5.3 [SD=3.8%], p=0.80), and a similar percentage of lower- versus higher-income women achieved a ≥5% weight loss (52.6% vs 53.8%, p=0.93).


CONCLUSIONS
An Internet behavioral weight loss program plus financial incentives may be an effective strategy to promote excellent weight losses in women with lower income, thereby enhancing equity in treatment outcomes in a vulnerable, high-risk population. These data also provide important evidence to support federally funded incentive initiatives for lower-income, underserved populations.",29338951,2018,Small Incentives Improve Weight Loss in Women From Disadvantaged Backgrounds.

Reducing the burden of death from cardiovascular disease includes risk factor reduction and medical interventions.


METHODS
This was an observational analysis at the hospital service area (HSA) level, to examine regional variation and relationships between behavioral risks, health services utilization, and cardiovascular disease mortality (the outcome of interest). HSA-level prevalence of cardiovascular disease behavioral risks (smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity) were calculated from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; HSA-level rates of stress tests, diagnostic cardiac catheterization, and revascularization from a statewide multi-payer claims data set from Maine in 2013 (with 606,260 patients aged ≥35 years), and deaths from state death certificate data. Analyses were done in 2016.


RESULTS
There were marked differences across 32 Maine HSAs in behavioral risks: smoking (12.4%-28.6%); poor diet (43.6%-73.0%); and physical inactivity (16.4%-37.9%). After adjustment for behavioral risks, rates of utilization varied by HSA: stress tests (28.2-62.4 per 1,000 person-years, coefficient of variation=17.5); diagnostic cardiac catheterization (10.0-19.8 per 1,000 person-years, coefficient of variation=17.3); and revascularization (4.6-6.2 per 1,000 person-years; coefficient of variation=9.1). Strong HSA-level associations between behavioral risk factors and cardiovascular disease mortality were observed: smoking (R2=0.52); poor diet (R2=0.38); and physical inactivity (R2=0.35), and no association between revascularization and cardiovascular disease mortality after adjustment for behavioral risk factors (R2=0.02). HSA-level behavioral risk factors were also strongly associated with all-cause mortality: smoking (R2=0.57); poor diet (R2=0.49); and physical inactivity (R2=0.46).


CONCLUSIONS
There is substantial regional variation in behavioral risks and cardiac utilization. Behavioral risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease mortality regionally, whereas revascularization is not. Efforts to reduce cardiovascular disease mortality in populations should focus on prevention efforts targeting modifiable risk factors.",29338952,2018,Behavioral Risk Factors and Regional Variation in Cardiovascular Health Care and Death.
288,"INTRODUCTION
Transgender (trans) and gender-nonconforming adults have reported reduced access to health care because of discrimination and lack of knowledgeable care. This study aimed to contribute to the nascent cancer prevention literature among trans and gender-nonconforming individuals by ascertaining rates of breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening behaviors by gender identity.


METHODS
Publicly available de-identified data from the 2014-2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys were utilized to evaluate rates of cancer screenings by gender identity, while controlling for healthcare access, sociodemographics, and survey year. Analyses were conducted in 2017.


RESULTS
Weighted chi-square tests identified significant differences in the proportion of cancer screening behaviors by gender identity among lifetime colorectal cancer screenings, Pap tests, prostate-specific antigen tests, discussing prostate-specific antigen test advantages/disadvantages with their healthcare provider, and up-to-date colorectal cancer screenings and Pap tests (p<0.036). Weighted logistic regressions found that although some differences based on gender identity were fully explained by covariates, trans women had reduced odds of having up-to-date colorectal cancer screenings compared to cisgender (cis) men (AOR=0.20) and cis women (AOR=0.24), whereas trans men were more likely to ever receive a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy as compared to cis men (AOR=2.76) and cis women (AOR=2.65). Trans women were more likely than cis men to have up-to-date prostate-specific antigen tests (AOR=3.19). Finally, trans men and gender-nonconforming individuals had reduced odds of lifetime Pap tests versus cis women (AOR=0.14 and 0.08, respectively), and gender-nonconforming individuals had lower odds of discussing prostate-specific antigen tests than cis men (AOR=0.09; all p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The findings indicate that gender identity disparities in cancer screenings persist beyond known sociodemographic and healthcare factors. It is critical that gender identity questions are included in cancer and other health-related surveillance systems to create knowledge to better inform healthcare practitioners and policymakers of appropriate screenings for trans and gender-nonconforming individuals.",29338956,2018,Gender Identity Disparities in Cancer Screening Behaviors.
289,"INTRODUCTION
Commute time is associated with reduced sleep time, but previous studies have relied on self-reported sleep assessment. The present study investigated the relationships between commute time for employment and objective sleep patterns among non-shift working U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults.


METHODS
From 2010 to 2013, Hispanic/Latino employed, non-shift-working adults (n=760, aged 18-64 years) from the Sueño study, ancillary to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, reported their total daily commute time to and from work, completed questionnaires on sleep and other health behaviors, and wore wrist actigraphs to record sleep duration, continuity, and variability for 1 week. Survey linear regression models of the actigraphic and self-reported sleep measures regressed on categorized commute time (short: 1-44 minutes; moderate: 45-89 minutes; long: ≥90 minutes) were built adjusting for relevant covariates. For associations that suggested a linear relationship, continuous commute time was modeled as the exposure. Moderation effects by age, sex, income, and depressive symptoms also were explored.


RESULTS
Commute time was linearly related to sleep duration on work days such that each additional hour of commute time conferred 15 minutes of sleep loss (p=0.01). Compared with short commutes, individuals with moderate commutes had greater sleep duration variability (p=0.04) and lower interdaily stability (p=0.046, a measure of sleep/wake schedule regularity). No significant associations were detected for self-reported sleep measures.


CONCLUSIONS
Commute time is significantly associated with actigraphy-measured sleep duration and regularity among Hispanic/Latino adults. Interventions to shorten commute times should be evaluated to help improve sleep habits in this minority population.",29338957,2018,Commuting and Sleep: Results From the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Sueño Ancillary Study.
290,"Recently, we reported that chronic nicotine significantly improved chronic stress-induced impairments of cognition and the hippocampal synaptic plasticity in mice, however, the underlying mechanism still needs to be explored. In the present study, 32 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: control (CON), stress (CUS), stress with chronic nicotine administration (CUS + Nic) and chronic nicotine administration (Nic). The anxiety-like behavior and neuropathological alteration of DG neurons were examined. Moreover, PC12 cells were examined with corticosterone in the presence or absence of nicotine. Both cell viability and apoptosis were determined. When treated simultaneously with an unpredictable chronic mild stress (CUS), nicotine (0.2 mg/kg/d) attenuated behavioral deficits and neuropathological alterations of DG neurons. Moreover, Western blotting showed that chronic nicotine also elevated the level of autophagy makers including Beclin-1 and LC3 II triggered by CUS. In addition, concomitant treatment with nicotine (10 μM) significantly attenuated the loss of PC12 cell viability (p < .01) and apoptosis compared to that of corticosterone treatment alone. Besides, chronic nicotine also enhanced the protein and RNA expression levels of autophagy makers triggered by corticosterone, such as Beclin-1, LC3 II and p62/SQSTM1. However, the above improvements were significantly blocked by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Importantly, the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was carefully tested to illuminate the effects of chronic nicotine. Consequently, chronic nicotine played a role of neuroprotection in either CUS mice or corticosterone cells associating with the enhancement of the autophagy signaling, which was involved in activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.",29339018,2018,Nicotine alleviates chronic stress-induced anxiety and depressive-like behavior and hippocampal neuropathology via regulating autophagy signaling.
291,"BACKGROUND
Golgi Reassembly and Stacking Proteins (GRASPs) are widely spread among eukaryotic cells (except plants) and are considered as key components in both the stacking of the Golgi cisternae and its lateral connection. Furthermore, GRASPs were also proved essential in the unconventional secretion pathway of several proteins, even though the mechanism remains obscure. It was previously observed that the GRASP homologue in Cryptococcus neoformans has a molten globule-like behavior in solution.


METHODS
We used circular dichroism, synchrotron radiation circular dichroism and steady-state as well as time-resolved fluorescence.


RESULTS
We report the disorder-to-order transition propensities for a native molten globule-like protein in the presence of different mimetics of cell conditions. Changes in the dielectric constant (such as those experienced close to the membrane surface) seem to be the major factor in inducing multiple disorder-to-order transitions in GRASP, which shows very distinct behavior when in conditions that mimic the vicinity of the membrane surface as compared to those found when free in solution. Other folding factors such as molecular crowding, counter ions, pH and phosphorylation exhibit lower or no effect on GRASP secondary structure and/or stability.


GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on understanding the disorder-to-order transitions of a molten globule structure without the need of any mild denaturing condition. A model is also introduced aiming at describing how the cell could manipulate the GRASP sensitivity to changes in the dielectric constant during different cell-cycle periods.",29339081,2018,Disorder-to-order transitions in the molten globule-like Golgi Reassembly and Stacking Protein.
292,"BACKGROUND
Efflux pumps of the Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division superfamily confer multi-drug resistance to Gram-negative bacteria. The most-studied polyspecific transporter belonging to this class is the inner-membrane trimeric antiporter AcrB of Escherichia coli. In previous studies, a functional rotation mechanism was proposed for its functioning, according to which the three monomers undergo concerted conformational changes facilitating the extrusion of substrates. However, the molecular determinants and the energetics of this mechanism still remain unknown, so its feasibility must be proven mechanistically.


METHODS
A computational protocol able to mimic the functional rotation mechanism in AcrB was developed. By using multi-bias molecular dynamics simulations we characterized the translocation of the substrate doxorubicin driven by conformational changes of the protein. In addition, we estimated for the first time the free energy profile associated to this process.


RESULTS
We provided a molecular view of the process in agreement with experimental data. Moreover, we showed that the conformational changes occurring in AcrB enable the formation of a layer of structured waters on the internal surface of the transport channel. This water layer, in turn, allows for a fairly constant hydration of the substrate, facilitating its diffusion over a smooth free energy profile.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings reveal a new molecular mechanism of polyspecific transport whereby water contributes by screening potentially strong substrate-protein interactions.


GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE
We provided a mechanistic understanding of a fundamental process related to multi-drug transport. Our results can help rationalizing the behavior of other polyspecific transporters and designing compounds avoiding extrusion or inhibitors of efflux pumps.",29339082,2018,Water-mediated interactions enable smooth substrate transport in a bacterial efflux pump.
293,"Psychological construction models of emotion state that emotions are variable concepts constructed by fundamental psychological processes, whereas according to basic emotion theory, emotions cannot be divided into more fundamental units and each basic emotion is represented by a unique and innate neural circuitry. In a previous study, we found evidence for the psychological construction account by showing that several brain regions were commonly activated when perceiving different emotions (i.e. a general emotion network). Moreover, this set of brain regions included areas associated with core affect, conceptualization and executive control, as predicted by psychological construction models. Here we investigate directed functional brain connectivity in the same dataset to address two questions: 1) is there a common pathway within the general emotion network for the perception of different emotions and 2) if so, does this common pathway contain information to distinguish between different emotions? We used generalized psychophysiological interactions and information flow indices to examine the connectivity within the general emotion network. The results revealed a general emotion pathway that connects neural nodes involved in core affect, conceptualization, language and executive control. Perception of different emotions could not be accurately classified based on the connectivity patterns from the nodes of the general emotion pathway. Successful classification was achieved when connections outside the general emotion pathway were included. We propose that the general emotion pathway functions as a common pathway within the general emotion network and is involved in shared basic psychological processes across emotions. However, additional connections within the general emotion network are required to classify different emotions, consistent with a constructionist account.",29339312,2018,Studying emotion theories through connectivity analysis: Evidence from generalized psychophysiological interactions and graph theory.
294,"OBJECTIVE
We recently developed soft neural interfaces enabling the delivery of electrical and chemical stimulation to the spinal cord. These stimulations restored locomotion in animal models of paralysis. Soft interfaces can be placed either below or above the dura mater. Theoretically, the subdural location combines many advantages, including increased selectivity of electrical stimulation, lower stimulation thresholds, and targeted chemical stimulation through local drug delivery. However, these advantages have not been documented, nor have their functional impact been studied in silico or in a relevant animal model of neurological disorders using a multimodal neural interface.


APPROACH
We characterized the recruitment properties of subdural interfaces using a realistic computational model of the rat spinal cord that included explicit representation of the spinal roots. We then validated and complemented computer simulations with electrophysiological experiments in rats. We additionally performed behavioral experiments in rats that received a lateral spinal cord hemisection and were implanted with a soft interface.


MAIN RESULTS
In silico and in vivo experiments showed that the subdural location decreased stimulation thresholds compared to the epidural location while retaining high specificity. This feature reduces power consumption and risks of long-term damage in the tissues, thus increasing the clinical safety profile of this approach. The hemisection induced a transient paralysis of the leg ipsilateral to the injury. During this period, the delivery of electrical stimulation restricted to the injured side combined with local chemical modulation enabled coordinated locomotor movements of the paralyzed leg without affecting the non-impaired leg in all tested rats. Electrode properties remained stable over time, while anatomical examinations revealed excellent bio-integration properties.

295,"Carcinoma cells frequently expand and invade from a confined lesion, or multicellular clusters, into and through the stroma on the path to metastasis, often with an efficiency dictated by the architecture and composition of the microenvironment. Specifically, in desmoplastic carcinomas such as those of the breast, aligned collagen tracks provide contact guidance cues for directed cancer cell invasion. Yet, the evolving dynamics of this process of invasion remains poorly understood, in part due to difficulties in continuously capturing both spatial and temporal heterogeneity and progression to invasion in experimental systems. Therefore, to study the local invasion process from cell dense clusters into aligned collagen architectures found in solid tumors, we developed a novel engineered 3D invasion platform that integrates an aligned collagen matrix with a cell dense tumor-like plug. Using multiphoton microscopy and quantitative analysis of cell motility, we track the invasion of cancer cells from cell-dense bulk clusters into the pre-aligned 3D matrix, and define the temporal evolution of the advancing invasion fronts over several days. This enables us to identify and probe cell dynamics in key regions of interest: behind, at, and beyond the edge of the invading lesion at distinct time points. Analysis of single cell migration identifies significant spatial heterogeneity in migration behavior between cells in the highly cell-dense region behind the leading edge of the invasion front and cells at and beyond the leading edge. Moreover, temporal variations in motility and directionality are also observed between cells within the cell-dense tumor-like plug and the leading invasive edge as its boundary extends into the anisotropic collagen over time. Furthermore, experimental results combined with mathematical modeling demonstrate that in addition to contact guidance, physical crowding of cells is a key regulating factor orchestrating variability in single cell migration during invasion into anisotropic ECM. Thus, our novel platform enables us to capture spatio-temporal dynamics of cell behavior behind, at, and beyond the invasive front and reveals heterogeneous, local interactions that lead to the emergence and maintenance of the advancing front.",29340409,2018,Dynamics of 3D carcinoma cell invasion into aligned collagen.
296,"American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) youth are characterized by high rates of pregnancy and risky sexual behavior. Reaching these youth with culturally appropriate interventions is difficult due to geographic dispersion and cultural isolation. Online interventions can provide opportunities for reaching and engaging AIAN youth. However, electronic interventions are also impersonal and this can be culturally incongruous for AIANs and other populations for whom traditional ceremonies, practices and patterns of interpersonal communication are central. This paper describes the application of community based participatory research methods to: (1) identify concerns about the exclusive use of an online sexual health program; (2) address community concerns by developing supplemental class lessons, and (3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the new hybrid intervention. Data derives from qualitative and quantitative sources. During the formative phase of the project, qualitative data from partner interactions was analyzed with participatory inquiry to inform intervention development. To evaluate the intervention, qualitative data (e.g., interviews, surveys) were used to understand and explain quantitative measures such as implementation fidelity and attendance. Implementers were enthusiastic about the hybrid intervention. The lessons were easy to teach and provided opportunities for meaningful discussions, adaptations, and community involvement. The use of online videos was an effective method for providing training. Working with community partners, we resolved cultural concerns arising from the exclusive use of the Internet by creating a hybrid intervention. The additional burden for staff to deliver the class lessons was considered minimal in comparison to the educational and programmatic benefits of the hybrid intervention.

297,"The relationship between recovery and fatigue and its impact on performance has attracted the interest of sport science for many years. An adequate balance between stress (training and competition load, other life demands) and recovery is essential for athletes to achieve continuous high-level performance. Research has focused on the examination of physiological and psychological recovery strategies to compensate external and internal training and competition loads. A systematic monitoring of recovery and the subsequent implementation of recovery routines aims at maximizing performance and preventing negative developments such as underrecovery, nonfunctional overreaching, the overtraining syndrome, injuries, or illnesses. Due to the inter- and intraindividual variability of responses to training, competition, and recovery strategies, a diverse set of expertise is required to address the multifaceted phenomena of recovery, performance, and their interactions to transfer knowledge from sport science to sport practice. For this purpose, a symposium on Recovery and Performance was organized at the Technical University Munich Science and Study Center Raitenhaslach (Germany) in September 2016. Various international experts from many disciplines and research areas gathered to discuss and share their knowledge of recovery for performance enhancement in a variety of settings. The results of this meeting are outlined in this consensus statement that provides central definitions, theoretical frameworks, and practical implications as a synopsis of the current knowledge of recovery and performance. While our understanding of the complex relationship between recovery and performance has significantly increased through research, some important issues for future investigations are also elaborated.",29345524,2018,Recovery and Performance in Sport: Consensus Statement.
298,"BACKGROUND
Athletes experience various situations and conditions that can interfere with their sleep, which is crucial for optimal psychological and physiological recovery as well as subsequent performance. Conventional sleep screening and intervention approaches may not be efficacious for athletes given their lifestyle, the demands of training and travel associated with interstate/international competition.


OBJECTIVES
The present systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate sleep intervention studies targeting subsequent performance and recovery in competitive athletes. Based on the findings, a secondary aim was to outline a possible sleep intervention for athletes, including recommendations for content, mode of delivery and evaluation.


METHODS
A systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA guidelines in May 2016 with an update completed in September 2017. Ten studies met our inclusion criteria comprising a total of 218 participants in the age range of 18-24 years with athletes from various sports (e.g., swimming, soccer, basketball, tennis). A modified version of the quality assessment scale developed by Abernethy and Bleakley was used to evaluate the quality of the studies.


RESULTS
The included studies implemented several sleep interventions, including sleep extension and napping, sleep hygiene, and post-exercise recovery strategies. Evidence suggests that sleep extension had the most beneficial effects on subsequent performance. Consistent with previous research, these results suggest that sleep plays an important role in some, but not all, aspects of athletes' performance and recovery.


CONCLUSION
Future researchers should aim to conduct sleep interventions among different athlete populations, compare results, and further establish guidelines and intervention tools for athletes to address their specific sleep demands and disturbances.",29352373,2018,Sleep Interventions Designed to Improve Athletic Performance and Recovery: A Systematic Review of Current Approaches.

To investigate the views of a range of hospital based health professionals and health care staff involved in the management of stillbirth.


STUDY DESIGN
A qualitative pilot study informed by grounded theory conducted in three hospital trusts in the North East of England. In total, 21 consultant obstetricians, 3 trainees (including 1 senior trainee), 29 midwives, 3 midwife sonographers and 4 chaplains took part in six focus groups and two semi-structured interviews.


RESULTS
Two different approaches in stillbirth management could be detected in our study. One approach emphasised the existing evidence-base and patient directed choice whilst the other emphasised tradition and profession-directed care. These differences were particularly apparent in choices over mode of delivery, and the location of women as well as the time interval between diagnosis of an IUD and delivery. The existence of these two approaches was underscored by a lack of high quality evidence.


CONCLUSION
Robust, high quality evidence is needed regarding the longer term psychological and emotional sequelae of different modes of delivery and varying time intervals and locations of women between diagnosis and delivery in stillbirth. If the competing discourses demonstrated here are found elsewhere then such need to be considered in any future policy development, evidence implementation and training programmes.",29353132,2018,Supporting parents through stillbirth: A qualitative study exploring the views of health professionals and health care staff in three hospitals in England.
300,"INTRODUCTION
The WHO and the HCSP recognize the Zika virus as a public health problem of international concern primarily because of the foetal risks. During the epidemic in Martinique, several modifications to the normal obstetrical follow-up were set up and information had to be delivered to pregnant women about these modifications, the attitudes to prevent infection and the signs motivating additional visits. The objective of our work was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant women in Martinique about the risks associated with Zika infection during pregnancy in the immediate aftermath of the epidemic.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to May 2017. It took place through an anonymous and standardized face-to-face questionnaire. The questions dealt with the pregnant women general knowledge about the virus, information disseminated by media on this subject, the potential risks, the protective measures taken and the monitoring throughout the pregnancy in case of infection.


RESULTS
The total sample consisted of 297 pregnant women. Despite a weak adherence to individual and domestic protection recommendations, we found a good level of knowledge about Zika virus from pregnant women in Martinique. The fetal risk in case of maternal infection was known for 96.6% of those surveyed, individual protective measures were followed by 64.6% of women, 77.0% knew where to go in case of suspected infection, and 79.4% reported that the modifications in follow-up mainly concerned ultrasound monitoring.


CONCLUSION

Nevertheless, modification of individual behavior appeared harder to obtain.",29353134,2018,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant women in Martinique in the immediate aftermath of the Zika virus outbreak."
301,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a reservoir for biologically active factors, such as growth factors and proteases that influence the tumor cell behavior. ADAMTS-1 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) is a secreted protease that has the ability to modify the ECM during physiological and pathological processes. Here, we analyzed the role played by ADAMTS-1 regulating HGF and TGF-β1 activities in the high-grade fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080). We generated HT1080 and HEK293T cells overexpressing ADAMTS-1. HT1080 cells overexpressing ADAMTS-1 (HT1080-MPA) exhibited a significant decrease in cell proliferation and migration velocity, both in presence of HGF. We obtained similar results with ADAMTS-1-enriched conditioned medium from other cell type. However, ADAMTS-1 overexpression failed to affect TGF-β1 activity associated with HT1080 cell proliferation and migration velocity. Immunoblotting showed that ADAMTS-1 overexpression disturbs c-Met activation upon HGF stimulation. Downstream ERK1/2 and FAK signaling pathways are also influenced by this protease. Additionally, ADAMTS-1 decreased the size of the fibrosarcospheres, both under normal conditions and in the presence of HGF. Likewise, in presence of HGF, ADAMTS-1 overexpression in HT1080 disrupted microtumors formation in vivo.

302,"Alpha-synuclein plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). A robust transgenic mouse model has been generated that overexpresses the mutant human A53T alpha-synuclein under the mouse prion protein gene promoter; these mice develop age-dependent motor deficits. Recently, compared to wild-type (WT) littermates, A53T alpha-synuclein mice were reported to display non-motor symptom deficits, e.g., anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, odor discrimination and detection impairments, and gastrointestinal dysfunction, at 6 months of age or older. However, the differences between heterozygous and homozygous mice in terms of non-motor symptoms and whether the genomic DNA levels of alpha-synuclein correlate with the symptoms have not yet been elucidated. In the present work, we used littermate WT and heterozygous and homozygous A53T mice that were characterized by a modified genotyping protocol and observed a unilateral decline in the dopamine transporter (DAT) distribution from 3 months to 12 months of age in homozygous mice. We evaluated non-motor symptoms by measuring colon motility, anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and motor coordination. The results showed that homozygous A53T mice exhibited earlier abnormal non-motor symptoms compared to their heterozygous littermates. The severity of impaired colon motility as well as anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors were correlated with the genomic DNA levels of A53T mutant alpha-synuclein. More noticeable, motor coordination aberrances were also observed in homozygous A53T mice. This study provides direct evidence that the genomic DNA levels of mutant alpha-synuclein correlate with non-motor symptoms in an A53T mouse model, indicating that the genomic DNA levels of mutant alpha-synuclein should be tightly manipulated in PD model studies.",29355568,2018,Genomic DNA levels of mutant alpha-synuclein correlate with non-motor symptoms in an A53T Parkinson's disease mouse model.
303,"OBJECTIVE
Acrolein, a highly reactive unsaturated aldehyde, is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and oxidative damage induced by acrolein is hypothesized to involve in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Calorie restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention that has consistently been verified to retard aging by ameliorating oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CR on acrolein-induced neurotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.


METHODS
A total of 45 weaned and specific-pathogen-free SD rats (male, weighing 180-220 g) were gavage-fed with acrolein (2.5 mg/kg/day) and fed ab libitum of 10 g/day or 7 g/day (representing 30% CR regimen), or gavage-fed with same volume of tap water and fed al libitum as vehicle control for 12 weeks. After behavioral test conducted by Morris Water Maze, SD rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were prepared for histochemical evaluation and Western blotting to detect alterations in oxidative stress, BDNF/TrkB pathway and key enzymes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism.


RESULTS
Treatment with 30% CR in SD rats significantly attenuated acrolein-induced cognitive impairment. Oxidative damage including deletion of glutathione and superoxide dismutase and sharp rise in malondialdehyde were notably improved by 30% CR. Further study suggested that 30% CR showed protective effects against acrolein by modulating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways. Moreover, 30% CR restored acrolein-induced changes of APP, β-secretase, α-secretase and receptor for advanced glycation end products.


CONCLUSION
These findings suggest that CR may provide a promising approach for the treatment of AD, targeting acrolein.",29355571,2018,Caloric restriction ameliorates acrolein-induced neurotoxicity in rats.
304,"Ritonavir (RTV) is a weakly basic drug with a pH-dependent solubility. In vitro characterization of dissolution and supersaturation behaviors of three PEG-8000 based amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) and a physical blend (PB) with crystalline drug were performed in the biomimetic media (e.g., FaSSGF, FaSSIF, FaSSIF-V2). A two-stage dissolution test and a biphasic dissolution-partition test at the small scale (referred as to biphasic test) were employed with intention to examine the in vitro and in vivo relationship (IVIVR) with retrospective PK data in dog model. The two-stage dissolution test revealed a high degree of supersaturation of RTV from these ASDs accompanied by the occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the biomimetic media. A rapid decrease of apparent RTV concentrations of these ASDs was associated with significant precipitation upon the pH shift of the dissolution medium, revealing the important role of ""the gastric stage"". In comparison, the biphasic test revealed a lower degree of supersaturation of RTV that is attributed to removal of RTV through partition into octanol, acting as ""the absorption compartment"". These two dissolution tests provide characterization of the supersaturation state with a complex, dynamic interplay among dissolution, precipitation and partition processes. Results of both in vitro dissolution tests are in good agreement with in vivo results in dogs. In addition, three commercial generic RTV drug products were examined by the biphasic test. Agreement was also obtained between the RTV concentrations in octanol at 3 h from these generic drug products and their corresponding relative bioavailability in dogs.",29355594,2018,In vitro characterization of ritonavir formulations and correlation to in vivo performance in dogs.
305,"To better understand the impact of aging, along with other demographic and brain health variables, on the neural networks that support different aspects of cognitive performance, we applied a brute-force search technique based on Principal Components Analysis to derive 4 corresponding spatial covariance patterns (termed Reference Ability Neural Networks -RANNs) from a large sample of participants across the age range. 255 clinically healthy, community-dwelling adults, aged 20-77, underwent fMRI while performing 12 tasks, 3 tasks for each of the following cognitive reference abilities: Episodic Memory, Reasoning, Perceptual Speed, and Vocabulary. The derived RANNs (1) showed selective activation to their specific cognitive domain and (2) correlated with behavioral performance. Quasi out-of-sample replication with Monte-Carlo 5-fold cross validation was built into our approach, and all patterns indicated their corresponding reference ability and predicted performance in held-out data to a degree significantly greater than chance level. RANN-pattern expression for Episodic Memory, Reasoning and Vocabulary were associated selectively with age, while the pattern for Perceptual Speed showed no such age-related influences. For each participant we also looked at residual activity unaccounted for by the RANN-pattern derived for the cognitive reference ability. Higher residual activity was associated with poorer brain-structural health and older age, but -apart from Vocabulary-not with cognitive performance, indicating that older participants with worse brain-structural health might recruit alternative neural resources to maintain performance levels.",29355766,2018,Reference ability neural networks and behavioral performance across the adult life span.
306,"Ras proteins are oncoproteins which play a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. All Ras proteins' signaling strongly depends on their correct localization in the cell membrane. Over 30% of cancers are driven by mutant Ras proteins, and KRas4B is the Ras isoform most frequently mutated. C6-ceramide has been shown to inhibit the growth activity of KRas4B mutated cells. However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition remains elusive. Here, we established a heterogeneous model biomembrane containing C6-ceramide. C6-ceramide incorporation does not disrupt the lipid membrane. Addition of KRas4B leads to drastic changes in the lateral membrane organization of the membrane, however. In contrast to the partitioning behavior in other membranes, KRas4B forms small, monodisperse nanoclusters dispersed in a fluid-like environment, in all likelihood induced by some kind of lipid sorting mechanism. Fluorescence cross-correlation data indicate no direct interaction between C6-ceramide and KRas4B, suggesting that KRas4B essentially recruits other lipids. A FRET-based binding assay reveals that the stability of KRas4B proteins inserted into the membrane containing C6-ceramide is reduced. Based on the combined results obtained, we postulate a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of KRas4B mutated cells' activity through C6-ceramide.",29357287,2018,Interaction of KRas4B protein with C6-ceramide containing lipid model membranes.
307,"Sleep loss is a common problem in modern societies affecting different aspects of individuals' lives. Many studies have reported that sleep deprivation (SD) leads to impairments in various types of learning and memory. Physical exercise has been suggested to attenuate the cognitive impairments induced by sleep deprivation in male rats. Our previous studies have shown that forced exercise by treadmill improved learning and memory impairments following SD. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of voluntary exercise by running wheel on cognitive, motor and anxiety-like behavior functions of female rats following 72 h SD. Intact female rats were used in the present study. The multiple platform method was applied for the induction of 72 h SD. The exercise protocol was 4 weeks of running wheel and the cognitive function was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM), passive avoidance and novel object recognition tests. Open field test and measurement of plasma corticosterone level were performed for evaluation of anxiety-like behaviors. Motor balance evaluation was surveyed by rotarod test. In this study, remarkable learning and long-term memory impairments were observed in sleep deprived rats in comparison to the other groups. Running wheel exercise ameliorated the SD-induced learning and memory impairments. Voluntary and mandatory locomotion and balance situation were not statistically significant among the different groups.

308,"Speaking more than one language is associated with neurocognitive benefits in seniors (Alladi et al. 2013). Few studies however have tested this hypothesis directly by comparing bilingual seniors who vary in chronological age. We report a Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) study showing cumulative effects of age on grey matter volume (GMV) in brain structures that are involved in cognitive control in bilingual seniors and found no differences in RT or accuracy between bilingual and monolingual seniors on a behavioral test of cognitive control called the Attentional Network Task (ANT), and no differences in GMV for selected ROIs between groups. However, chronological age predicted the size of interference and conflict effects for monolingual speakers only. We also observed a more widespread pattern of bilateral aging-effcts in brain regions that are classically associated with aging in monolingual speakers compared to bilingual speakers. Notably, GMV in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the level of daily exposure to a second language (L2) independently predict performance on the ANT in bilingual speakers. We conclude that regular (daily) bilingual experience mitigates the typical effects of aging on cognitive control at the behavioral and the neural level.",29360516,2018,Bilingualism and healthy aging: Aging effects and neural maintenance.

Behavioral data, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) and induced event-related oscillations (EROs) were analyzed. At the behavioral level, deprived participants showed speeded reaction times to new stimuli. Analyses of ERPs indicated that starting from 1000 ms the recognition of old objects elicited enhanced positive amplitudes only for the visually deprived group. Visual deprivation also influenced EROs. In this sense, we observed reduced power in the lower-1 alpha band for the processing of new compared to old stimuli between 500 and 750 ms. Overall, our data showed improved haptic recognition memory after a short period of visual deprivation. These effects were thought to reflect a compensatory mechanism that might have developed as an adaptive strategy for dealing with the environment when visual information is not available.",29360562,2018,Haptic recognition memory following short-term visual deprivation: Behavioral and neural correlates from ERPs and alpha band oscillations.
310,"Although tissue engineering has been attracted greatly for healing of critical-sized bone defects, great efforts for improvement are still being made in scaffold design. In particular, bone regeneration would be enhanced if a scaffold precisely matches the contour of bone defects, especially if it could be implanted into the human body conveniently and safely. In this study, polyurethane/hydroxyapatite-based shape memory polymer (SMP) foam was fabricated as a scaffold substrate to facilitate bone regeneration. The minimally invasive delivery and the self-fitting behavior of the SMP foam were systematically evaluated to demonstrate its feasibility in the treatment of bone defects in vivo. Results showed that the SMP foam could be conveniently implanted into bone defects with a compact shape. Subsequently, it self-matched the boundary of bone defects upon shape-recovery activation in vivo. Micro-computed tomography determined that bone ingrowth initiated at the periphery of the SMP foam with a constant decrease towards the inside. Successful vascularization and bone remodeling were also demonstrated by histological analysis. Thus, our results indicate that the SMP foam demonstrated great potential for bone regeneration.",29360569,2018,Self-fitting shape memory polymer foam inducing bone regeneration: A rabbit femoral defect study.
311,"OBJECTIVE
We present a theory and computational methods to incorporate transverse polarization of neuronal membranes into the cable equation to account for the secondary electric field generated by the membrane in response to transverse electric fields. The effect of transverse polarization on nonlinear neuronal activation thresholds is quantified and discussed in the context of previous studies using linear membrane models.


APPROACH
The response of neuronal membranes to applied electric fields is derived under two time scales and a unified solution of transverse polarization is given for spherical and cylindrical cell geometries. The solution is incorporated into the cable equation re-derived using an asymptotic model that separates the longitudinal and transverse dimensions. Two numerical methods are proposed to implement the modified cable equation. Several common neural stimulation scenarios are tested using two nonlinear membrane models to compare thresholds of the conventional and modified cable equations.


MAIN RESULTS
The implementations of the modified cable equation incorporating transverse polarization are validated against previous results in the literature. The test cases show that transverse polarization has limited effect on activation thresholds. The transverse field only affects thresholds of unmyelinated axons for short pulses and in low-gradient field distributions, whereas myelinated axons are mostly unaffected.


SIGNIFICANCE
The modified cable equation captures the membrane's behavior on different time scales and models more accurately the coupling between electric fields and neurons. It addresses the limitations of the conventional cable equation and allows sound theoretical interpretations. The implementation provides simple methods that are compatible with current simulation approaches to study the effect of transverse polarization on nonlinear membranes. The minimal influence by transverse polarization on axonal activation thresholds for the nonlinear membrane models indicates that predictions of stronger effects in linear membrane models with a fixed activation threshold are inaccurate. Thus, the conventional cable equation works well for most neuroengineering applications, and the presented modeling approach is well suited to address the exceptions.",29363622,2018,Modified cable equation incorporating transverse polarization of neuronal membranes for accurate coupling of electric fields.
312,"Cardiolipin in eukaryotes is found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts with membrane proteins and, although not essential, is necessary for the optimal activity of a number of proteins. One of them is the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, which imports ADP into the mitochondrion and exports ATP. In the crystal structures, cardiolipin is bound to three equivalent sites of the ADP/ATP carrier, but its role is unresolved. Conservation of residues at these cardiolipin binding sites across other members of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily indicates cardiolipin binding is likely to be important for the function of all mitochondrial carriers. Multiscale simulations were performed in a cardiolipin-containing membrane to investigate the dynamics of cardiolipin around the yeast and bovine ADP/ATP carriers in a lipid bilayer and the properties of the cardiolipin-binding sites. In coarse-grain simulations, cardiolipin molecules bound to the carriers for longer periods of time than phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids-with timescales in the tens of microseconds. Three long-lived cardiolipin binding sites overlapped with those in the crystal structures of the carriers. Other shorter-lived cardiolipin interaction sites were identified in both membrane leaflets. However, the timescales of the interactions were of the same order as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting that these sites are not specific for cardiolipin binding. The calculation of lipid binding times and the overlap of the cardiolipin binding sites between the structures and simulations demonstrate the potential of multiscale simulations to investigate the dynamics and behavior of lipids interacting with membrane proteins.",29366674,2018,Cardiolipin dynamics and binding to conserved residues in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier.
313,"Human behavior and cognition result from a complex pattern of interactions between brain regions. The flexible reconfiguration of these patterns enables behavioral adaptation, such as the acquisition of a new motor skill. Yet, the degree to which these reconfigurations depend on the brain's baseline sensorimotor integration is far from understood. Here, we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in sensorimotor networks at baseline were predictive of individual differences in future learning. We analyzed functional MRI data from 19 participants prior to six weeks of training on a new motor skill. We found that visual-motor connectivity was inversely related to learning rate: sensorimotor autonomy at baseline corresponded to faster learning in the future. Using three additional scans, we found that visual-motor connectivity at baseline is a relatively stable individual trait. These results suggest that individual differences in motor skill learning can be predicted from sensorimotor autonomy at baseline prior to task execution.",29366697,2018,Predicting future learning from baseline network architecture.
314,"The temporal dynamics of waiting are complex. The present study used a video game involving contingencies that produced differential reinforcement of wait times by arranging for the magnitude of the reward to be related to the duration of each inter-response time. In previous research, when outcomes were gradually increasing in value from a minimum to a maximum, two modes of behavior are observed: waiting as little as possible before cashing in (i.e., responding rapidly) or waiting until the maximum is available (i.e., responding slowly). When outcomes were either a smaller sooner or larger later reward, two modes of behavior were again observed which corresponded to choosing either reward immediately after it was available. In the present study, outcome values increased linearly for a period of time, leveled off, increased abruptly, and then increased linearly. This configuration produced three modes of wait times in people - responding immediately, responding immediately after the abrupt increase, and responding when the maximum possible reward was achieved on each trial. Three factors were evaluated as possible causes of each behavioral mode, a desire for immediacy or action, the trade-off between molecular and molar maximization, and ease of responding.",29366751,2018,The temporal dynamics of waiting when reward is increasing.
315,"BACKGROUND
Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are school-aged and typically carry a backpack. It is important to understand how this task affects walking. Weighted vests (WVs) often prescribed to mitigate behavioral effects of ASD. The effects of backpack and WV walking have not been examined in children with ASD.


AIMS
To quantify differences in lower extremity mechanics in children with ASD during WV and backpack walking.


METHODS
Eight male participants completed 15 trials in three conditions: body mass, and carrying or wearing a backpack or WV with 15% added body mass. Three-dimensional kinematic data were collected and normalized to 100% of the gait cycle. The Model Statistic was utilized to test for bilateral asymmetries between the lower extremity joints at all points along the gait cycle.


RESULTS
Analysis revealed similar numbers of significant asymmetries in hip (71.0, 70.4, 60.6), knee (68.4, 71.5, 74.6), and ankle (64.1, 68.9, 68.4) for unloaded, backpack, and WV, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Participants exhibited individualized kinematic symmetry-responses to the loaded conditions compared to the unloaded condition. These findings suggest that 15% body mass backpack or WV does not affect gait symmetry in children with ASD.",29366924,2018,Examination of gait parameters during perturbed over-ground walking in children with autism spectrum disorder.
316,"OBJECTIVE
Attentional bias (AB) may be one mechanism contributing to the development and/or maintenance of disordered eating. AB has traditionally been measured using reaction time in response to a stimulus. Novel methods for AB measurement include eye tracking to measure visual fixation on a stimulus, and electroencephalography to measure brain activation in response to a stimulus. This systematic review summarizes, critiques, and integrates data on AB gathered using the above-mentioned methods in those with binge eating behaviors, including binge eating, loss of control eating, and bulimia nervosa.


METHOD
Literature searches on PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted using combinations of terms related to binge eating and biobehavioral AB paradigms. Studies using AB paradigms with three categories of stimuli were included: food, weight/shape, and threat. For studies reporting means and standard deviations of group bias scores, Hedges' g effect sizes for group differences in AB were calculated.


RESULTS
Fifty articles met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Individuals who binge eat in the absence of compensatory behaviors show an increased AB to food cues, but few studies have examined such individuals' AB toward weight/shape and threatening stimuli. Individuals with bulimia nervosa consistently show an increased AB to shape/weight cues and socially threatening stimuli, but findings for AB to food cues are mixed.


DISCUSSION
While there are important research gaps, preliminary evidence suggests that the combination of AB to disorder-specific cues (i.e., food and weight/shape) and AB toward threat may be a potent contributor to binge eating. This conclusion underscores previous findings on the interaction between negative affect and AB to disorder-specific cues. Recommendations for future research are provided.",29366932,2018,A systematic review of attentional biases in disorders involving binge eating.
317,"While the effects of nectar robbing on plants are relatively well-studied, its impacts from the perspective of the pollinators of robbed plants is not. Numerous studies do consider the impacts of robbing on pollinator visitation to robbed plants, but rarely do they focus on its scaled-up impacts on individual pollinator behavior. We used radio telemetry to track the spatial and behavioral responses of the territorial hummingbird Aglaeactis cupripennis to experimental nectar robbing over a period of several days. Simulated nectar robbing impacted foraging behavior by increasing territory area, distance flown, and reliance on novel food resources, especially small-bodied flying insects. We did not observe any impact on the amount of time individuals spent foraging, nor did we observe territory abandonment. These findings indicate that nectar robbing may impose a significant energetic cost on pollinators via increased flight distances and shifts towards potentially less profitable food resources, and demonstrate the importance of quantifying the indirect effects of nectar robbing on pollinators in addition to plants.",29369784,2018,Impacts of nectar robbing on the foraging ecology of a territorial hummingbird.
318,"A simple method for producing highly porous materials suitable for chromatographic applications is discussed. Starting from a dispersion of polymer core-shell nanoparticles (latex), micrometer sized clusters (100 μm) are produced via shear-induced Reactive Gelation. Thanks to their fractal structure, these aggregates exhibit highly porous structures, with pore size distribution ranging from 0.1 to several micrometers. The effect of different properties of the primary nanoparticles on the qualities of the final products is also investigated. Particle architecture, namely the ratio between the hard, highly crosslinked core, and the soft, poorly crosslinked shell, turned out to be the most important parameter to be tuned in order to obtain highly porous and mechanically resistant clusters. The final materials can be easily slurry-packed into conventional chromatographic columns. In comparison to other commercial stationary phases, these materials show not only much lower pressure drops at very high flow rates (i.e. <0.2 bar/cm at 6 mL/min), but also HETP profiles independent of fluid velocity when measured with tracers of sizes comparable to typical bio-macromolecules. Moreover, these materials, while offering the key advantage of being in a slurry form and thus easily packable and scalable, have a behavior that closely resembles that of monoliths, in which convective flow contribution dominates.",29370918,2018,Preparation of perfusive chromatographic materials via shear-induced reactive gelation.
319,"l-DOPA remains the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, its therapeutic benefits are compromised by the development of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) known as l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). The norepinephrine (NE) system originating in the locus coeruleus is profoundly affected in PD and known to influence dopamine (DA) signaling. However, the effect of noradrenergic loss on l-DOPA-induced striatal monoamine efflux and Parkinsonian motor behavior remains controversial and is frequently overlooked in traditional animal models of LID. Thus, the current study sought to determine whether degeneration of the DA and/or NE system(s) altered l-DOPA-induced striatal monoamine efflux in hemiparkinsonian rats with additional NE loss induced by the potent NE-toxin α DA beta hydroxylase (DBH)-saporin. Sham-, DA-, NE-, and dual DA + NE-lesioned rats were treated with l-DOPA (6 mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 weeks. Thereafter, l-DOPA-mediated striatal monoamine efflux was measured with in vivo microdialysis, and concurrent AIMs testing occurred to determine responsiveness to l-DOPA. Noradrenergic lesions exacerbated parkinsonian motor deficits but did not significantly alter LID expression or corresponding l-DOPA-induced striatal monoamine efflux. Interestingly, l-DOPA-induced striatal NE efflux rather than DA efflux, corresponded more closely with dyskinesia severity. Moreover, marked reductions in striatal NE tissue concentration did not appear to impact l-DOPA-induced striatal NE efflux. The current study implicates l-DOPA-induced striatal NE as an important factor in LID expression and demonstrates the importance of developing treatment strategies that co-modulate the NE and DA systems.",29371053,2018,Striatal norepinephrine efflux in l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
320,"The current study investigated behavioral and neuroimaging evidence for orthographic influences on auditory word identification. To assess such influences, the proportion of similar sounding words (i.e. phonological neighbors) that were also spelled similarly (i.e., orthographic neighbors) was computed for each auditorily presented word as the Orthographic-to-Phonological Overlap Ratio (OPOR). Speech intelligibility was manipulated by presenting monosyllabic words in multi-talker babble at two signal-to-noise ratios: + 3 and + 10 dB SNR. Identification rates were lower for high overlap words in the challenging + 3 dB SNR condition. In addition, BOLD contrast increased with OPOR at the more difficult SNR, and decreased with OPOR under more favorable SNR conditions. Both voxel-based and region of interest analyses demonstrated robust effects of OPOR in several cingulo-opercular regions. However, contrary to prior theoretical accounts, no task-related activity was observed in posterior regions associated with phonological or orthographic processing. We suggest that, when processing is difficult, orthographic-to-phonological feature overlap increases the availability of competing responses, which then requires additional support from domain general performance systems in order to produce a single response.",29371094,2018,Orthographic influence on spoken word identification: Behavioral and fMRI evidence.
321,"The location of neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) activated by intra-oral infusion of solutions in conscious rats was mapped using Fos immunohistochemistry. Groups of adult male Wistar rats (N's = 5) received an infusion of one of the following: dH2O, 0.1 or 1.0 M NaCl, 0.1 or 1.0 M sucrose, 0.32 M MSG (with 100 µM amiloride and 2.5 M inosine 5'-monophosphate), 0.03 M HCl, or 0.003 M QHCl delivered via an intra-oral cannula (0.233 ml/min for 5 min). Unstimulated control rats received no infusion. Taste reactivity (TR) behaviors were videotaped and scored. The number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-IR) neurons was counted in eight sections throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the GC in the medial and lateral halves of the granular (GI), dysgranular (DI), and dorsal (AID) and ventral (AIV) agranular insular cortices. Intra-oral infusion of dH2O, NaCl, or sucrose altered the number of Fos-IR neurons in only specific subareas of the GC and the effects of these tastants were concentration-dependent. For example, 1.0 M NaCl increased Fos-IR neurons in the posterior lateral AID and DI and elicited more aversive TR responses than 0.1 M NaCl. Compared to dH2O, infusions of HCl or QHCl increased the total number of Fos-IR neurons in many subareas of the GC throughout its anterior-posterior extent and increased aversive TR behaviors. Linear regression analyses suggested that neurons in the medial AID of the posterior GC may influence aversive behavioral responses to HCl and QHCl while neurons in the posterior lateral AID and DI may play a role in aversive TR responses to 1.0 M NaCl.",29371098,2018,Distribution of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the gustatory cortex elicited by intra-oral infusion of taste solutions in conscious rats.
322,"Typically developing infants rapidly acquire a sophisticated array of social skills within the first year of life. These social skills are largely learned within the context of day-to-day interactions with caregivers. While social neuroscience has made great gains in our knowledge of the underlying neural circuitry of social cognition and behavior, much of this work has focused on experiments that sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising methodology for measuring brain activity in the context of naturalistic social interactions. Here, we review what we have learned from fNIRS studies that have used traditional experimental stimuli to study social development during infancy. We then discuss recent infant fNIRS studies that have utilized more naturalistic social stimuli, followed by a discussion of applications of this methodology to the study of atypical social development, with a focus on infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder.

The aim of this laboratory study was to analyze the influence of titanium dioxide (TiO2) content and antagonistic material on the wear of polyetherketoneketones (PEKKs).


METHODS
Twenty-four disk-shaped specimens of two PEKK materials containing either 10wt% or 20wt% TiO2 particles (P10 and P20) were dynamically loaded in a chewing simulator with 49N and additional thermal cycling (5-55°C). Subgroups of 8 specimens each were loaded with spherical antagonists made from either steatite ceramic (St), zirconia (Zr), or the same PEKK material (P10 or P20). After 120,000, 240,000, 480,000, 840,000, and 1,200,000 loading cycles the vertical substance loss and the volume loss of the loaded specimens were evaluated using a laser scanner. Data were checked considering the normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test) and were inspected for significant differences by means of single factor variance analyses and post hoc pair comparison (Games-Howell test).


RESULTS
After 1,200,000 chewing cycles, statistical analyses revealed a significant influence of the antagonistic material. A significant difference was also found between the tested PEKKs if Zr was used as the antagonist. The volume loss ranged from between 0.073mm3 (P20-P20) and 0.228mm3 (P10-St), and the vertical substance loss ranged between 73.71μm (P20-P20) and 115.268μm (P10-Zr).

However, less is known about how decreased striatal dopamine signaling affects cognitive flexibility. Past studies indicate that the rat dorsomedial striatum is a striatal subregion that supports cognitive flexibility. Because PD patients exhibit probabilistic reversal learning deficits, the present experiment investigated whether the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injected into the dorsomedial striatum of male Long-Evans rats affects the acquisition and/or reversal learning of a spatial discrimination using a probabilistic learning procedure (80/20). Behavioral testing was conducted in a cross maze that occurred across two consecutive days. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions were not impaired on acquisition, but were impaired in reversal learning compared to that of sham controls. In reversal learning, dorsomedial striatal dopamine depletion led to initial perseveration of the previously correct choice pattern, as well as an impairment in maintaining the new choice pattern after initially selected (regressive errors). A 6-OHDA lesion in the dorsomedial striatum also significantly increased 'lose-shift' probabilities in reversal learning suggesting that reduced dopamine signaling in this striatal area increased sensitivity to negative feedback ultimately impairing the maintenance of a new response pattern. Overall, the findings suggest that dopamine reduction in this striatal subregion can serve as a useful model to test novel treatments for ameliorating cognitive flexibility deficits in PD.",29374536,2018,Cognitive Flexibility Deficits Following 6-OHDA Lesions of the Rat Dorsomedial Striatum.
326,"Among insects, Hymenoptera present a striking olfactory system with a clear neural dichotomy from the periphery to higher order centers, based on two main tracts of second-order (projection) neurons: the medial and lateral antennal lobe tracts (m-ALT and l-ALT). Despite substantial work on this dual pathway, its exact function is yet unclear. Here, we ask how attributes of odor quality and odor quantity are represented in the projection neurons (PNs) of the two pathways. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we compared the responses of m-ALT and l-ALT PNs of the honey bee Apis mellifera to a panel of 16 aliphatic odorants, and to three chosen odorants at eight concentrations. The results show that each pathway conveys differential information about odorants' chemical features or concentration to higher order centers. While the l-ALT primarily conveys information about odorants' chain length, the m-ALT informs about odorants' functional group. Furthermore, each tract can only predict chemical distances or bees' behavioral responses for odorants that differ according to its main feature, chain length or functional group. Generally l-ALT neurons displayed more graded dose-response relationships than m-ALT neurons, with a correspondingly smoother progression of inter-odor distances with increasing concentration. Comparison of these results with previous data recorded at AL input reveals differential processing by local networks within the two pathways. These results support the existence of parallel processing of odorant features in the insect brain.",29374539,2018,Differential Processing by Two Olfactory Subsystems in the Honeybee Brain.
327,"Synesthesia is associated with additional perceptual experiences, which are automatically and consistently triggered by specific inducing stimuli. Synesthesia is also accompanied by more general sensory and cortical changes, including enhanced modality-specific cortical excitability. Extensive cognitive training has been shown to generate synesthesia-like phenomenology but whether these experiences are accompanied by neurophysiological changes characteristic of synesthesia remains unknown. Addressing this question provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the neural basis of perceptual plasticity relevant to conscious experiences. Here we investigate whether extensive training of letter-color associations leads not only to synesthetic experiences, but also to changes in cortical excitability. We confirm that overtraining synesthetic associations results in synesthetic phenomenology. Stroop tasks further reveal synesthesia-like performance following training. Electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation show, respectively, enhanced visual evoked potentials (in response to untrained patterns) and lower phosphene thresholds, demonstrating specific cortical changes. An active (using letter-symbol training) and a passive control confirmed these results were due to letter-color training and not simply to repeated testing. Summarizing, we demonstrate specific cortical changes, following training-induced acquisition of synesthetic phenomenology that are characteristic of genuine synesthesia. Collectively, our data reveal dramatic plasticity in human visual perception, expressed through a coordinated set of behavioral, neurophysiological, and phenomenological changes.",29378205,2018,"Coordinated neural, behavioral, and phenomenological changes in perceptual plasticity through overtraining of synesthetic associations."
328,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compact (SNpc), with consequent depletion of dopamine in the striatum, which gives rise to the characteristic motor symptoms of PD. Although its etiology is unknown, several studies have suggested that oxidative stress plays a critical function in the pathophysiology of PD, and antioxidant agents could be helpful to slown down the dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Carvacrol (CA) is a phenolic monoterpene found in essential oils of many aromatic plants that presents antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to assess the effect of CA in a reserpine (RES)-induced rat model of PD. Male Wistar rats received 15 s.c. injections of 0.1 mg/kg RES or vehicle, every other day, concomitantly to daily i.p. injections of CA (12.5 or 25 mg/kg) or vehicle. Across the treatment, the animals were submitted to behavioral evaluation in the catalepsy test (performed daily), open field test (7th day) and assessment of vacuous chewing movements (12th, 20th and 30th days). Upon completion of behavioral tests, rats were perfused and their brains underwent tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemical analysis. Our results showed that CA (12.5 e 25 mg/kg) prevented the increase in catalepsy behavior and number of vacuous chewing movements, but failed to revert the decreased open-field locomotor activity induced by RES. In addition, CA in both doses prevented the decrease in TH immunostaining induced by RES in the SNpc and dorsal striatum. Taken together, our results suggest that CA shows a protective effect in a rat model of PD, preventing motor and neurochemical impairments induced by RES. Thus, the use of CA as a promising new strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of PD may be considered.",29378222,2018,Carvacrol prevents impairments in motor and neurochemical parameters in a model of progressive parkinsonism induced by reserpine.
329,"Affective states, such as anticipatory anxiety, critically influence speech communication behavior in adults who stutter. However, there is currently little evidence regarding the involvement of the limbic system in speech disfluency during interpersonal communication. We designed this neuroimaging study and experimental procedure to sample neural activity during interpersonal communication between human participants, and to investigate the relationship between the amygdala activity and speech disfluency. Participants were required to engage in live communication with a stranger of the opposite sex in the MRI scanner environment. In the gaze condition, the stranger gazed at the participant without speaking, while in the live conversation condition, the stranger asked questions that the participant was required to answer. The stranger continued to gaze silently at the participant while the participant answered. Adults who stutter reported significantly higher discomfort than fluent controls during the experiment. Activity in the right amygdala, a key anatomical region in the limbic system involved in emotion, was significantly correlated with stuttering occurrences in adults who stutter. Right amygdala activity from pooled data of all participants also showed a significant correlation with discomfort level during the experiment. Activity in the prefrontal cortex, which forms emotion regulation neural circuitry with the amygdala, was decreased in adults who stutter than in fluent controls. This is the first study to demonstrate that amygdala activity during interpersonal communication is involved in disfluent speech in adults who stutter.",29378280,2018,Speech Disfluency-dependent Amygdala Activity in Adults Who Stutter: Neuroimaging of Interpersonal Communication in MRI Scanner Environment.
330,"OBJECTIVE
Adult picky eating (PE) has received increased attention in the eating behavior literature due to its important association with adult avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). The current study tested a model of potential risk factors of adult PE behavior, including perceived early parental feeding practices. An exploratory model was also utilized to understand associations with different aspects of adult PE behaviors.


METHODS
A sample of 1339 US adults recruited through Amazon's MTurk completed an online survey that included the recently developed Adult Picky Eating Questionnaire (APEQ), retrospective reports of parental feeding practices, and other measures of eating behavior and demographic variables. A structural equation modeling procedure tested a series of regression models that included BMI and disordered eating behaviors as covariates.


RESULTS
SEM modeling indicated that retrospective reports of greater parental pressure to eat, higher disgust sensitivity, lower PE age of onset, and experiencing an aversive food event were associated with general adult PE behavior. Results also indicated parental encouragement of healthy eating may be a protective factor, and that men endorsed higher levels of adult PE. Exploratory analyses indicated that cross-sectional predictors and covariates were differentially related to specific aspects of PE as measured by the APEQ subscales.


CONCLUSIONS
Early experiences, including parental approaches to feeding, appear to be potential risk factors of PE behavior in adults. A nuanced understanding of adult PE is important for the prevention and treatment of severe PE behaviors, related psychosocial impairment, and ARFID.",29378295,2018,A multidimensional approach to understanding the potential risk factors and covariates of adult picky eating.
331,"Sleep deprivation (SD) has been associated with cognitive and emotional disruptions, however its impact on the acquisition of fear and subsequent fear memory consolidation remain unknown. To address this question, we measured human brain activity before and after fear acquisition under conditions of 24 h sleep deprivation versus normal sleep using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Additionally, we explored whether the fear acquisition-induced change of brain activity during the fear memory consolidation window can be predicted by subjective fear ratings and autonomic fear response, assessed by skin conductance responses (SCR) during acquisition. Behaviorally, the SD group demonstrated increased subjective and autonomic fear responses compared to controls at the stage of fear acquisition. During the stage of fear consolidation, the SD group displayed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity and concomitantly increased amygdala activity. Moreover, in the SD group fear acquisition-induced brain activity changes in amygdala were positively correlated with both, subjective and autonomic fear indices during acquisition, whereas in controls changes vmPFC activity were positively correlated with fear indices during acquisition. Together, the present findings suggested that SD may weaken the top-down ability of the vmPFC to regulate amygdala activity during fear memory consolidation. Moreover, subjective and objective fear at fear acquisition stage can predict the change of brain activity in amygdala in fear memory consolidation following SD.",29378319,2018,Alter spontaneous activity in amygdala and vmPFC during fear consolidation following 24 h sleep deprivation.
332,"In animal experiments, neuroscientists typically assess the effectiveness of interventions by comparing the average response of groups of treated and untreated animals. While providing useful insights, focusing only on group effects risks overemphasis of small, statistically significant but physiologically unimportant, differences. Such differences can be created by analytical variability or physiological within-individual variation, especially if the number of animals in each group is small enough that one or two outlier values can have considerable impact on the summary measures for the group. Physicians face a similar dilemma when comparing two results from the same patient. To determine whether the change between two values reflects disease progression or known analytical and physiological variation, the magnitude of the difference between two results is compared to the reference change value. These values are generated by quantifying analytical and within-individual variation, and differences between two results from the same patient are considered clinically meaningful only if they exceed the combined effect of these two sources of 'noise'. In this article, we describe how the reference change interval can be applied within neuroscience. This form of analysis provides a measure of outcome at an individual level that complements traditional group-level comparisons, and therefore, introduction of this technique into neuroscience can enrich interpretation of experimental data. It can also safeguard against some of the possible misinterpretations that may occur during analysis of the small experimental groups that are common in neuroscience and, by illuminating analytical error, may aid in design of more efficient experimental methods.",29380453,2018,When neuroscience met clinical pathology: partitioning experimental variation to aid data interpretation in neuroscience.
333,"Ionic liquids are used for myriad applications, including as catalysts, solvents, and propellants. Specifically, 2-hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate (HEHN) has been developed as a chemical propellant for space applications. The gas-phase behavior of HEHN ions and clusters is important in understanding its potential as an electrospray thruster propellant. Here, the unimolecular dissociation pathways of two clusters are experimentally observed, and theoretical modeling of hydrogen bonding and dissociation pathways is used to help rationalize those observations. The cation/deprotonated cation cluster [HEH2 - H]+, which is observed from electrospray ionization, is calculated to be considerably more stable than the complementary cation/protonated anion adduct, [HEH + HNO3]+, which is not observed experimentally. Upon collisional activation, a larger cluster [(HEHN)2HEH]+ undergoes dissociation via loss of nitric acid at lower collision energies, as predicted theoretically. At higher collision energies, additional primary and secondary loss pathways open, including deprotonated cation loss, ion-pair loss, and double-nitric-acid loss. Taken together, these experimental and theoretical results contribute to a foundational understanding of the dissociation of protic ionic liquid clusters in the gas phase.",29382196,2018,Theoretical and Experimental Insights into the Dissociation of 2-Hydroxyethylhydrazinium Nitrate Clusters Formed via Electrospray.
334,"Cerebral ischemia is the most common cause of stroke with high morbidity, disability and mortality. Sirtuin-2 (Sirt2), a vitally important NAD+-dependent deacetylase which has been widely researched in central nervous system diseases, has also been identified as a promising treatment target using its specific inhibitors such as AK-7. In this study, we found that P38 was specifically activated after focal cerebral ischemic injury, and it was also significantly activated after AK-7 administration in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. AK-7 decreased the infarction volume remarkably and promoted the recovery of neurological function efficiently in the mice evaluated by behavior tests. In contrast, pP38 inhibition increased the infarct volume and exacerbated the symptoms of paralysis. Herein, we suggest AK-7 improves the outcome of brain ischemia in dependence on the P38 activation in mice, which may serve as a strategy for the treatment of stroke.",29382550,2018,Neuroprotective Effect of Sirt2-specific Inhibitor AK-7 Against Acute Cerebral Ischemia is P38 Activation-dependent in Mice.
335,"Implicit moral evaluations-spontaneous, unintentional judgments about the moral status of actions or persons-are thought to play a pivotal role in moral experience, suggesting a need for research to model these moral evaluations in clinical populations. Prior research reveals that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a critical area underpinning affect and morality, and patients with vmPFC lesions show abnormalities in moral judgment and moral behavior. We use indirect measurement and multinomial modeling to understand differences in implicit moral evaluations among patients with vmPFC lesions. Our model quantifies multiple processes of moral judgment: implicit moral evaluations in response to distracting moral transgressions (Unintentional Judgment), accurate moral judgments about target actions (Intentional Judgment), and a directional tendency to judge actions as morally wrong (Response Bias). Compared to individuals with non-vmPFC brain damage and neurologically healthy comparisons, patients with vmPFC lesions showed a dual deficit in processes of moral judgment. First, patients with vmPFC lesions showed reduced Unintentional Judgment about moral transgressions, but not about non-moral negative affective distracters. Second, patients with vmPFC lesions showed reduced Intentional Judgment about target actions. These findings highlight the utility of a formal modeling approach in moral psychology, revealing a dual deficit in multiple component processes of moral judgment among patients with vmPFC lesions.",29382558,2018,Damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is associated with impairments in both spontaneous and deliberative moral judgments.
336,"Weight regain after weight loss is one of the most significant challenges to successful obesity treatment. Regular exercise has long been touted as a strategy for weight loss maintenance, but the lack of clear evidence in clinical trials has caused some to question its effectiveness. In this review, we present the arguments both questioning and in support of exercise as an obesity therapeutic. Our purpose is to bring clarity to the literature, present a unified perspective, and identify the gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in future studies. Critical questions remain including sex differences, individual variability and compensatory behaviors in response to exercise, exercise adherence, the role of energy flux and the molecular mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of exercise after weight loss and during weight regain. Future research should focus on these critical questions to provide a more complete understanding of the potential benefits of exercise on weight loss maintenance.",29382563,2018,Is regular exercise an effective strategy for weight loss maintenance?
337,"Some of the neurobehavioral deficits identified in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) have been recapitulated in a binge model of gestational third trimester-equivalent ethanol (EtOH) exposure, in which Sprague-Dawley rats are intragastrically intubated between post-natal day (PD) 4 and PD9 with high doses of EtOH. In this model, the ameliorating effects of choline (Chol) administration on hippocampus-dependent behaviors altered by EtOH have also been extensively documented. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EtOH (5 g/kg/day) and/or Chol (100 mg/kg/day) on morphometric parameters of CA1 pyramidal neurons by Golgi-Cox staining followed by Neurolucida tracing and analysis. We found that EtOH increased apical dendrite complexity in male and female pups neonatally exposed to EtOH. EtOH did not significantly affect basal dendrite parameters in female and male rats. Interestingly, Chol treatments decreased basal dendrites' length, number, and maximal terminal distance in male pups. When pups were co-treated with EtOH and Chol, Chol did not rescue the effect of EtOH. In conclusion, EtOH increases while Chol decreases dendritic length and arborization of hippocampal CA1 neurons in PD9 rats. We hypothesize that developmental EtOH exposure induces a premature maturation of neurons, leading to early restriction of neuronal plasticity while Chol treatments delay the normal program of neuronal maturation and therefore prolong the window of maximal plasticity. Chol does not prevent the effects of developmental alcohol exposure on hippocampal pyramidal neurons' morphology characterized in the present study, although whether prolonged Chol administration after developmental EtOH exposure rectifies EtOH damage remains to be assessed.",29391132,2018,Neonatal Ethanol and Choline Treatments Alter the Morphology of Developing Rat Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons in Opposite Directions.

The fundamental question of why our nervous systems have evolved to require sleep remains a topic of ongoing scientific deliberation. This question is largely being addressed by research using animal models of sleep. Drosophila melanogaster, also known as the common fruit fly, exhibits a sleep state that shares common features with many other species. Drosophila sleep studies have unearthed an immense wealth of knowledge about the neuroscience of sleep. Given the breadth of findings published on Drosophila sleep, it is important to consider how all of this information might come together to generate a more holistic understanding of sleep.

339,"Adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to incentives and relatively weak cognitive control, which may contribute to risky behaviors. Studies of brain activity have generally identified greater activation of the ventral striatum to rewards and less activation of prefrontal regions during control tasks in adolescents compared to adults. Little is known, however, about age-related changes in the functional brain networks underlying incentive processing and cognitive control. This cross-sectional study characterized the effects of incentives on inhibitory control during an oculomotor task using whole-brain functional connectivity analyses. During an fMRI scan, one hundred forty typically developing individuals completed an incentivized antisaccade task consisting of incentive cue, preparation, and response phases. We found that task modulation of control networks increased gradually from childhood to adulthood, whereas a network including ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex displayed an adolescent-specific peak in response to the receipt of outcomes, consistent with dual-systems models. Notably, however, greater modulation of salience and motor networks during the preparation phase mediated age-related improvements in antisaccade accuracy, whereas adolescent enhancement of value-related circuitry did not. Relative to neutral cues, both reward and loss cues enhanced task-related connectivity of the salience network when preparing to inhibit a saccade. Altogether, our findings suggest that incentives facilitate inhibitory control by enhancing the salience of one's responses and that over development, the recruitment of functional networks involved in saliency and motor preparation supports better performance.",29391243,2018,Incentives facilitate developmental improvement in inhibitory control by modulating control-related networks.
340,"Stem cell shape appears to be involved in the regulation of osteogenesis, which has been confirmed in two-dimensional surfaces and three-dimensional hydrogels. The present study evaluated the effect of matrix-controlled cellular shape on osteogenesis in three-dimensional porous scaffolds based on sodium alginate (ALG) and chitosan (CS). Three ALG/CS scaffolds, especially including a stiff one, were fabricated from different precursor matrices. Soft scaffold A was fabricated from the ALG/CS polyelectrolyte and further cross-linked by Ca2+ and glutaraldehyde to achieve soft scaffold B with alternative hydrophilicity. Stiff scaffold C with ""hard-to-deform"" feature was fabricated from ""ALG/CS preformed gel"", which was an ALG gel network expanded by swelling force of the dissolving CS, and fixed using Ca2+ and glutaraldehyde. Scanning electron microscopy and F-actins staining showed rounded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the inner surfaces inside scaffold A with high swelling behavior, but spindlelike MSCs in scaffold B. Stiff scaffold C forced MSCs to adhere to polygonal shape. Fibronectin adsorption was found to be weakened in scaffold A. Integrin α5β1 expression, as well as osteogenesis-related genes (ALP, OCN) expression, was detected to be higher in the stiff scaffold C. Thus, the present study illustrated that the stiff scaffold C responded to cells with hard-to-deform information, leading to the amplification of focal adhesions and induction of high tension of cells, consequently enhancement of osteogenesis.",29392929,2018,"Homologous Sodium Alginate/Chitosan-Based Scaffolds, but Contrasting Effect on Stem Cell Shape and Osteogenesis."
341,"Although several approaches have been developed to fabricate hybrid monoliths, it would still take a few hours to finish the formation of monoliths. Herein, photo-initiated thiol-yne polymerization was first adopted to in situ fabricate hybrid monoliths within the confines of UV-transparent fused-silica capillary. A silicon-containing diyne (1,3-diethynyltetramethyl-disiloxane, DYDS) was copolymerized with three multithiols, 1,6-hexanedithiol, trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate) and pentaerythriol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate), by using a binary porogenic system of diethylene glycol diethyl ether (DEGDE)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG200) within 10 min. Several characterizations of three hybrid monoliths (assigned as I, II and III, respectively) were performed. The results showed that these hybrid monoliths possessed bicontinuous porous structure, which was remarkably different from that via typical free-radical polymerization. The highest column efficiency of 76,000 plates per meter for butylbenzene was obtained on the column I in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). It was observed that the efficiencies for strong-retained butylbenzene were almost close to those of weak-retained benzene, indicating a retention-independent efficient performance of small molecules on hybrid column I. The surface area of this hybrid monolith was very small in the dry state (less than 10.0 m2/g), and the chromatographic behavior of hybrid monolithic columns would be possibly explained by radical-mediated step-growth process of thiol-yne polymerization. Finally, the column I was applied for separation of BSA tryptic digest by cLC-MS/MS, indicating satisfactory separation ability for complicated samples.",29395162,2018,Fast preparation of hybrid monolithic columns via photo-initiated thiol-yne polymerization for capillary liquid chromatography.
342,"Hypotheses about change over time are central to informing our understanding of development. Developmental neuroscience is at critical juncture: although the majority of longitudinal imaging studies have observations with two time points, researchers are increasingly obtaining three or more observations of the same individuals. The goals of the proposed manuscript are to draw upon the long history of methodological and applied literature on longitudinal statistical models to summarize common problems and issues that arise in their use. We also provide suggestions and solutions to improve the design, analysis and interpretation of longitudinal data, and discuss the importance of matching the theory of change with the appropriate statistical model used to test the theory. Researchers should articulate a clear theory of change and to design studies to capture that change and use appropriately sensitive measures to assess that change during development. Simulated data are used to demonstrate several common analytic approaches to longitudinal analyses.

344,"The structural stability and phase transition behavior of tetragonal (I4/m) hollandite type K2Fe2Ti6O16 have been investigated by in situ high pressure X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation and a diamond anvil cell as well as by variable temperature powder neutron and X-ray diffraction. The tetragonal phase is found to be stable in a wider range of temperatures, while it reversibly transforms to a monoclinic (I2/m) structure at a moderate pressure, viz. 3.6 GPa. The pressure induced phase transition occurs with only a marginal change in structural arrangements. The unit cell parameters of ambient (t) and high pressure (m) phases can be related as am ∼ at, bm ∼ ct, and cm ∼ bt. The pressure evolution of the unit cell parameters indicates anisotropic compression with βa = βb ≥ βc in the tetragonal phase and becomes more anisotropic with βa ≪ βb < βc in the monoclinic phase. The pressure-volume equations of state of both phases have been obtained by second order Birch-Murnaghan equations of state, and the bulk moduli are 122 and 127 GPa for tetragonal and monoclinic phases, respectively. The temperature dependent unit cell parameters show nearly isotropic expansion, with marginally higher expansion along the c-axis compared to the a- and b-axes. The tetragonal to monoclinic phase transition occurs with a reduction of unit cell volume of about 1.1% while the reduction of unit cell volume up to 6 K is only about 0.6%.

Six rumen-cannulated multiparous Holstein cows (11.8 ± 3.9 d in milk; mean ± SD) were utilized in a 6 × 6 Latin square design experiment balanced for carryover effects with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments were AcA and NAc, with sodium chloride (CON) as a control, infused at a rate of ˜0.75 mol/h (0.5 L/h) into the RU or AB for the first 8 h following feeding, with a rest day between infusion days. Treatment sequences were assigned randomly to cows. Feeding behavior was recorded by a computerized data acquisition system and blood was sampled at 0, 4, and 8 h relative to the start of infusion. We hypothesized that AcA is more hypophagic than NAc, and that infusion into the AB is more hypophagic than infusion into the RU. Dry matter intakes (DMI) for the CON treatments were similar at 6.2 kg/8 h for RU and 6.1 kg/8 h for AB, and the AcA and NAc treatments interacted with site of infusion to affect DMI. The NAc-RU treatment did not reduce DMI (7.0 kg/8 h), whereas AcA-RU (2.6 kg/8 h), AcA-AB (3.7 kg/8 h), and NAc-AB (4.0 kg/8 h) decreased DMI compared with CON. Following infusions of AcA compared with NAc, there was a residual effect on DMI for the remainder of the day, but treatments did not affect DMI during the rest day. Treatments increased plasma acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations over time (interaction) and decreased plasma insulin concentration compared with CON. Plasma glucose concentration decreased over time after AcA-AB infusion compared with other treatments and CON. Plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentration increased over time for AcA compared with NAc and CON, suggesting an increase in lipolysis to compensate the decrease in DMI. In contrast to the other treatments, NAc-RU did not decrease DMI compared with control but we cannot determine the reason for this from the data available from the current study.",29398027,2018,Effects of acetic acid or sodium acetate infused into the rumen or abomasum on feeding behavior and metabolic response of cows in the postpartum period.

348,"Diffuse white-matter disease associated with small-vessel disease and dementia is prevalent in the elderly. The biological mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Using pericyte-deficient mice, magnetic resonance imaging, viral-based tract-tracing, and behavior and tissue analysis, we found that pericyte degeneration disrupted white-matter microcirculation, resulting in an accumulation of toxic blood-derived fibrin(ogen) deposits and blood-flow reductions, which triggered a loss of myelin, axons and oligodendrocytes. This disrupted brain circuits, leading to white-matter functional deficits before neuronal loss occurs. Fibrinogen and fibrin fibrils initiated autophagy-dependent cell death in oligodendrocyte and pericyte cultures, whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of systemic fibrinogen levels in pericyte-deficient, but not control mice, influenced the degree of white-matter fibrin(ogen) deposition, pericyte degeneration, vascular pathology and white-matter changes.

Participants were instructed to respond to blue-framed Go trials quickly and accurately, and withhold responding for yellow-framed NoGo trials.


RESULTS
EOS made more Go response accuracy errors (p ≤ 0.02) and failed more frequently to inhibit responses to NoGo trials (p < 0.02) than LOS and HNS. EOS also made more errors in inhibiting responses to smoking-related (p ≤ 0.02) and neutral (p ≤ 0.02) NoGo trials. EOS reported greater baseline craving for cigarette smoking than LOS (p < 0.04), and craving was significantly associated with greater omission errors (p ≤ 0.04).


CONCLUSIONS
EOS exhibited greater difficulty than LOS in responding accurately to Go stimuli and withholding responses to both smoking and neutral NoGo stimuli, indicating greater response impulsivity, poor attention, and deficits in response inhibition. These findings suggest that EO smoking, in particular, contributes to diminished task-related attention and inhibitory control behaviors in adulthood and provide support for the tobacco-induced neurotoxicity of adolescent cognitive development (TINACD) theory (DeBry and Tiffany, 2008).",29402679,2018,Early onset tobacco cigarette smokers exhibit deficits in response inhibition and sustained attention.
350,"BACKGROUND
An established body of research documents that sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, and bisexual) populations are at higher risk for several adverse health behaviors and outcomes compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Smoking is one behavior where the gap is especially large, particularly among youth. Researchers have increasingly drawn attention to contextual determinants of health behaviors affecting sexual minority youth.


PURPOSE
Although these factors have evolved over time, few scholars have examined time as a contextual factor that affects sexual minority health behaviors or the level of inequality with heterosexual populations. We aimed to fill this gap.


PROCEDURES
We used eight years of data from the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey (MYRBS), pooled into four waves, to determine whether gaps between sexual minority and heterosexual youth have widened or narrowed for three different indicators of smoking: having ever smoked, early onset smoking, and daily cigarette smoking in the past 30 days.


RESULTS
We find that, though rates of smoking for all youth in Massachusetts have declined since the late 1990s, significant disparities remain between sexual minority and heterosexual youth.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings may suggest that targeted tobacco control programs in Massachusetts are needed; perhaps shifts in social attitudes toward smoking have affected smoking behaviors in diverse segments of society.",29402681,2018,Sexual minority youth continue to smoke cigarettes earlier and more often than heterosexuals: Findings from population-based data.
351,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an important biological target for therapy and diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this study, novel multivalent PSMA inhibitors with glutamate-urea-lysine structures were designed to improve inhibition characteristics. Precursors of the novel inhibitors were prepared from glutamic acid with di-tert-butyl ester. A near-infrared molecular dye, sulfo-Cy5.5, was introduced into the precursors to generate the final PSMA fluorescent inhibitors, compounds 12-14, to visualize prostate cancer. Biological behaviors of the inhibitors were evaluated using in vitro inhibition assays, in vivo fluorescent imaging, and ex vivo biodistribution assays. Ki values from inhibition studies indicated that dimeric inhibitor 13 with a glutamine linker showed approximately 3-fold more inhibitory activity than monomeric inhibitor 12. According to other biological studies using a mouse model of prostate cancer, dimeric inhibitor compounds 13 and 14 had higher tumor accumulation than the monomer. However, glutamine-based dimeric inhibitor 13 showed lower liver uptake than dimeric inhibitor 14, which had a benzene structure. Thus, these studies suggest that glutamine-based dimeric inhibitor 13 can be a promising optical inhibitor of prostate cancer.",29402740,2018,Synthesis of novel multivalent fluorescent inhibitors with high affinity to prostate cancer and their biological evaluation.
352,"Evidence from cognitive and social neuroscience research suggests that Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, is mediated by a group of brain regions collectively known as the ToM network. Nevertheless, there is significant variability in the functional activation of regions within this network across tasks. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to examine the common and differential neural mechanisms of two aspects of ToM processing (emotion/mental-state recognition and intentional attribution) using three distinct, but complementary ToM tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RMIE), Reading the Mind in the Voice (RMIV), and Intentional Causal Attribution) in healthy adults. Participant accuracy was significantly worse in the ToM compared to the control condition across all tasks. Brain activation analyses replicated previously reported activation in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle temporal gyrus extending to posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in RMIE. Activation in the fusiform gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyrus extending to temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) was unique to causality task. A region-of-interest analysis revealed shared activation in left IFG for RMIE and RMIV as well as TPJ recruitment specific to the causality task. The role of right TPJ in the causality task was further supported by a percent signal change analysis. A conjunction analysis revealed overlap in left IFG, left precentral gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus activity across all tasks. These findings highlight common and differential recruitment of ToM regions according to task demand.",29406267,2018,"Brain Mechanisms Underlying Reading the Mind from Eyes, Voice, and Actions."
353,"Environmental factors during early life stages affect behavioral and physiological phenotypes in adulthood. We examined the effect of photoperiods during development on neurogenesis and affective behaviors during adolescence/adulthood using C57BL/6J mice. Mice were born and raised until weaning under long-day conditions (LDs) or short-day conditions (SDs), followed by a 12L12D cycle until adulthood. Adult mice born under SD showed a shorter latency to first immobility in the forced swim test when compared with the mice born under LD. The mice born under SD also exhibited significantly lower prepulse inhibition, which is a characteristic of schizophrenia. However, the mice exposed to SD and LD during the prenatal period only did not show differences in prepulse inhibition. At 4 weeks of age, there were less 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of mice born under SD when compared with mice born under LD. Double immunostaining showed that the mice born under SD showed less BrdU/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocyte marker) cells when compared with mice born under LD. Furthermore, expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the DG was higher in mice born under SD, and the photoperiod-dependent changes in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the DG were abolished by administration of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the photoperiod in early life alters astrogenesis in the hippocampus via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and may relate to affective behaviors in adulthood.",29406270,2018,"Early-life Photoperiod Influences Depression-like Behavior, Prepulse Inhibition of the Acoustic Startle Response, and Hippocampal Astrogenesis in Mice."
354,"One of the major challenges in systems neuroscience is to identify brain networks and unravel their significance for brain function -this has led to the concept of the 'connectome'. Connectomes are currently extensively studied in large-scale international efforts at multiple scales, and follow different definitions with respect to their connections as well as their elements. Perhaps the most promising avenue for defining the elements of connectomes originates from the notion that individual brain areas maintain distinct (long-range) connection profiles. These connectivity patterns determine the areas' functional properties and also allow for their anatomical delineation and mapping. This rationale has motivated the concept of connectivity-based cortex parcellation. In the past ten years, non-invasive mapping of human brain connectivity has led to immense advances in the development of parcellation techniques and their applications. Unfortunately, many of these approaches primarily aim for confirmation of well-known, existing architectonic maps and, to that end, unsuitably incorporate prior knowledge and frequently build on circular argumentation. Often, current approaches also tend to disregard the specific apertures of connectivity measurements, as well as the anatomical specificities of cortical areas, such as spatial compactness, regional heterogeneity, inter-subject variability, the multi-scaling nature of connectivity information, and potential hierarchical organisation. From a methodological perspective, however, a useful framework that regards all of these aspects in an unbiased way is technically demanding. In this commentary, we first outline the concept of connectivity-based cortex parcellation and discuss its prospects and limitations in particular with respect to structural connectivity. To improve reliability and efficiency, we then strongly advocate for connectivity-based cortex parcellation as a modelling approach; that is, an approximation of the data based on (model) parameter inference. As such, a parcellation algorithm can be formally tested for robustness -the precision of its predictions can be quantified and statistics about potential generalization of the results can be derived. Such a framework also allows the question of model constraints to be reformulated in terms of hypothesis testing through model selection and offers a formative way to integrate anatomical knowledge in terms of prior distributions.",29407457,2018,Cortical parcellation based on structural connectivity: A case for generative models.
355,"Post-traumatic epilepsy is one of the most common and difficult to treat forms of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Currently, there is no effective way to prevent post-traumatic epileptogenesis. It is known that abnormalities of interneurons, particularly parvalbumin-containing interneurons, play a critical role in epileptogenesis following traumatic brain injury. Thus, enhancing the function of existing parvalbumin interneurons might provide a logical therapeutic approach to prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy. The known positive effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor on interneuronal growth and function through activation of its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B, and its decrease after traumatic brain injury, led us to hypothesize that enhancing trophic support might improve parvalbumin interneuronal function and decrease epileptogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we used the partial neocortical isolation ('undercut', UC) model of posttraumatic epileptogenesis in mature rats that were treated for 2 weeks, beginning on the day of injury, with LM22A-4, a newly designed partial agonist at the tropomyosin receptor kinase B. Effects of treatment were assessed with Western blots to measure pAKT/AKT; immunocytochemistry and whole cell patch clamp recordings to examine functional and structural properties of GABAergic interneurons; field potential recordings of epileptiform discharges in vitro; and video-EEG recordings of PTZ-induced seizures in vivo. Results showed that LM22A-4 treatment 1) increased pyramidal cell perisomatic immunoreactivity for VGAT, GAD65 and parvalbumin; 2) increased the density of close appositions of VGAT/gephyrin immunoreactive puncta (putative inhibitory synapses) on pyramidal cell somata; 3) increased the frequency of mIPSCs in pyramidal cells; and 4) decreased the incidence of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges in vitro. 5) Treatment of rats with PTX BD4-3, another partial TrkB receptor agonist, reduced the incidence of bicuculline-induced ictal episodes in vitro and PTZ induced electrographic and behavioral ictal episodes in vivo. 6) Inactivation of TrkB receptors in undercut TrkBF616A mice with 1NMPP1 abolished both LM22A-4-induced effects on mIPSCs and on increased perisomatic VGAT-IR. Results indicate that chronic activation of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B by a partial agonist after cortical injury can enhance structural and functional measures of GABAergic inhibition and suppress posttraumatic epileptogenesis. Although the full agonist effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B activation in epilepsy models have been controversial, the present results indicate that such trophic activation by a partial agonist may potentially serve as an effective therapeutic option for prophylactic treatment of posttraumatic epileptogenesis, and treatment of other neurological and psychiatric disorders whose pathogenesis involves impaired parvalbumin interneuronal function.",29408225,2018,Partial TrkB receptor activation suppresses cortical epileptogenesis through actions on parvalbumin interneurons.
356,"Clinical and preclinical findings suggest that individuals with abnormal responses to reward cues (stimuli associated with reward) may be at risk for maladaptive behaviors including obesity, addiction and depression. Our objective was to develop a new paradigm for producing appetitive conditioning using primary (food) rewards in humans, and investigate the equivalency of several outcomes previously used to measure appetitive responses to conditioned cues. We used an individualized food reward, and multimodal subjective, psychophysiological and behavioral measures of appetitive responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS) that predicted delivery of that food. We tested convergence among these measures of appetitive response, and relationships between these measures and action impulsivity, a putative correlate of appetitive conditioning. 90 healthy young adults participated. Although the paradigm produced robust appetitive conditioning in some measures, particularly psychophysiological ones, there were not strong correlations among measures of appetitive responses to the CS, as would be expected if they indexed a single underlying process. In addition, there was only one measure that related to impulsivity. These results provide important information for translational researchers interested in appetitive conditioning, suggesting that various measures of appetitive conditioning cannot be treated interchangeably.",29408238,2018,Measuring appetitive conditioned responses in humans.
357,"Pups have greater incentive value than males for rats during the postpartum estrus (PPE); a period when females are both maternally and sexually motivated. Mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been proposed as a general motivational circuit; however in the literature it has been more related to the control of the motivational aspects of maternal than sexual motivation of females. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of antagonizing dopaminergic neurotransmission of PPE females on their preference for pups over a male. To achieve this objective we tested PPE rats in a Y-maze with three-choice chambers (one containing eight pups, the other a male and the last one no stimulus) after the systemic administration of the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol (0.0; 0.025 or 0.05 mg/kg). Furthermore, to determine if this dopaminergic antagonist differentially affects maternal and sexual motivations when pups and male are not competing, we evaluated the effect of haloperidol in the preference of females for pups vs. a non-receptive female and for a male vs. a non-receptive female. In the preference test for pups vs. male, both doses of haloperidol decreased the time that females spent in pups' chamber while increased the time that they spent in male's chamber, resulting in a lack of preference between both incentives. Besides, haloperidol reduced the effort -attempts to get access to the stimuli- made by the females to obtain the pups. Conversely, 0.05 mg/kg of haloperidol did not affect the preference for both incentives when they were confronted to a non-receptive female. Together, these results indicate that the dopaminergic activity mediates pups' preference over male during the PPE and point toward a more relevant role of this system in females' behavioral output when incentives are competing.",29408305,2018,Dopaminergic activity mediates pups' over male preference of postpartum estrous rats.
358,"The period of in utero development is one of the most critical windows during which adverse conditions and exposures may influence the growth and development of the fetus as well as its future postnatal health and behavior. Maternal substance use during pregnancy remains a relatively common but nonetheless hazardous in utero exposure. For example, previous epidemiological studies have associated prenatal substance exposure with reduced birth weight, poor developmental and psychological outcomes, and increased risk for diseases and behavioral disorders (e.g., externalizing behaviors like ADHD, conduct disorder, and substance use) later in life. Researchers are now learning that many of the mechanisms whereby adverse in utero exposures may affect key pathways crucial for proper fetal growth and development are epigenetic in nature, with the majority of work in humans considering DNA methylation specifically. This review will explore the research to date on epigenetic alterations tied to maternal substance use during pregnancy and will also discuss the possible role of DNA methylation in the robust relationship between maternal substance use and later behavioral and developmental sequelae in offspring.",29408446,2018,Prenatal substance exposure and offspring development: Does DNA methylation play a role?
359,"The capacity to cryopreserve semen from captive cranes facilitates production of offspring from behaviorally incompatible or geographically separated pairs, and allows for long-term preservation of valuable genetic materials. The present study sought to develop effective cryopreservation protocols for whooping (Grus americana) and white-naped (Grus vipio) cranes, through examining the influences of two permeating (DMA and Me2SO) and one non-permeating (sucrose) cryoprotectants, as well as vitamin E on post-thaw sperm survival. In Study 1, ejaculates (whooping: n = 10, white-naped: n = 8) were collected and cryopreserved in one of six cryo-diluents (crane extender with: DMA; DMA+0.1M sucrose; Me2SO; Me2SO+0.1M sucrose; 0.1M sucrose; 0.2M sucrose) using a two-step cooling method. Frozen samples were thawed and assessed for overall motility, motion characteristics, membrane integrity, morphology, and ability to bind to the inner perivitelline membrane (IPVM). In Study 2, whooping crane ejaculates (n = 17) were frozen in crane extender containing Me2SO alone or with vitamin E (5 μg/mL or 10 μg/mL). Frozen samples were thawed and assessed as in Study 1, except the binding assay. White-naped crane sperm were more tolerant to cryopreservation than whooping crane (15% vs 6% post-thawed motility). In both species, sperm cryopreserved in medium containing Me2SO alone displayed higher post thaw survival and ability to bind to IPVM than the other cryodiluent treatments. Vitamin E supplementation exerted no benefits to post thaw motility or membrane integrity. The findings demonstrated that there was species specificity in the susceptibility to cryopreservation. Nevertheless, Me2SO was a preferred cryoprotectant for sperm from both whooping and white-naped cranes.",29408447,2018,Cryopreservation effects on sperm function and fertility in two threatened crane species.
360,"People judge food wasting as an immoral behavior. Although moral concerns vary widely across cultures, to this date, food wasting moral judgments were investigated only among rich and industrialized ones. This study reports first evidence of cultural variability on moral judgments of food wasting between modern and traditional cultures. We conducted our study among the Maasai - pastoralists of Ngorongoro, Yali - horticulturalists of West Papua, and among citizens of Poland. According to the results, Maasai judge food wasting as more immoral compared to Yali and Poles. What's more, Yali judge food wasting harsher than Poles. These results suggest that there are cultural differences in moral judgments of food wasting. These differences might reflect the impact of unstable ecology on food economy of a given society. We hypothesize that harsh moral judgment concerning food waste may serve as a cultural adaptation for food insecurity.",29408466,2018,"Ecology shapes moral judgments towards food-wasting behavior: Evidence from the Yali of West Papua, the Ngorongoro Maasai, and Poles."
361,"Identifying regional effects of interest in MRI datasets usually entails testing a priori hypotheses across many thousands of brain voxels, requiring control for false positive findings in these multiple hypotheses testing. Recent studies have suggested that parametric statistical methods may have incorrectly modeled functional MRI data, thereby leading to higher false positive rates than their nominal rates. Nonparametric methods for statistical inference when conducting multiple statistical tests, in contrast, are thought to produce false positives at the nominal rate, which has thus led to the suggestion that previously reported studies should reanalyze their fMRI data using nonparametric tools. To understand better why parametric methods may yield excessive false positives, we assessed their performance when applied both to simulated datasets of 1D, 2D, and 3D Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) and to 710 real-world, resting-state fMRI datasets. We showed that both the simulated 2D and 3D GRFs and the real-world data contain a small percentage (<6%) of very large clusters (on average 60 times larger than the average cluster size), which were not present in 1D GRFs. These unexpectedly large clusters were deemed statistically significant using parametric methods, leading to empirical familywise error rates (FWERs) as high as 65%: the high empirical FWERs were not a consequence of parametric methods failing to model spatial smoothness accurately, but rather of these very large clusters that are inherently present in smooth, high-dimensional random fields. In fact, when discounting these very large clusters, the empirical FWER for parametric methods was 3.24%. Furthermore, even an empirical FWER of 65% would yield on average less than one of those very large clusters in each brain-wide analysis. Nonparametric methods, in contrast, estimated distributions from those large clusters, and therefore, by construct rejected the large clusters as false positives at the nominal FWERs. Those rejected clusters were outlying values in the distribution of cluster size but cannot be distinguished from true positive findings without further analyses, including assessing whether fMRI signal in those regions correlates with other clinical, behavioral, or cognitive measures. Rejecting the large clusters, however, significantly reduced the statistical power of nonparametric methods in detecting true findings compared with parametric methods, which would have detected most true findings that are essential for making valid biological inferences in MRI data. Parametric analyses, in contrast, detected most true findings while generating relatively few false positives: on average, less than one of those very large clusters would be deemed a true finding in each brain-wide analysis. We therefore recommend the continued use of parametric methods that model nonstationary smoothness for cluster-level, familywise control of false positives, particularly when using a Cluster Defining Threshold of 2.5 or higher, and subsequently assessing rigorously the biological plausibility of the findings, even for large clusters. Finally, because nonparametric methods yielded a large reduction in statistical power to detect true positive findings, we conclude that the modest reduction in false positive findings that nonparametric analyses afford does not warrant a re-analysis of previously published fMRI studies using nonparametric techniques.",29408478,2018,Cluster-level statistical inference in fMRI datasets: The unexpected behavior of random fields in high dimensions.
362,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a poorly understood symptom affecting many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite growing evidence of a behavioral link between anxiety, attention and FOG in PD, no research to date has investigated the neural mechanisms that might explain this relationship. The present study therefore examined resting-state MRI functional connectivity between the amygdala, striatum and frontoparietal attentional control network in PD patients with (freezers: n = 19) and without FOG (non-freezers: n = 21) in the dopaminergic 'off' state. Functional connectivity was subsequently correlated with an objective measure of FOG severity and a subjective scale of affective disorder within each group. Connectivity between the right amygdala and right putamen was significantly increased in freezers compared to non-freezers (p < 0.01). Furthermore, freezers showed increased anti-coupling between the frontoparietal network and left amygdala (p = 0.011), but reduced anti-coupling between this network and the right putamen (p = 0.027) as compared to non-freezers. Key functional connections between the amygdala, putamen and frontoparietal network were significantly associated with FOG severity and a fear of falling. This study provides the first evidence that dysfunctional fronto-striato-limbic processes may underpin the link between anxiety and FOG in PD. It is proposed that freezers have heightened striato-limbic load and reduced top-down attentional control at rest, which when further challenged by the parallel processing demands of walking may precipitate FOG.",29408498,2018,Dysfunctional Limbic Circuitry Underlying Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease.
363,"The present in-vivo study investigated the behavior and performance of differently charged poly(lactic‑co‑glycolic) acid microparticles (PLGA MP) as vaccination platform. For this purpose, particles loaded with ovalbumin (OVA) as model antigen were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected in SKH1 mice. The utilized SKH1 hairless mice exhibit a fully operative immune system and allow parallel imaging investigations due to the lack of hair. Usage of this species enabled the combination of two investigations within a single study protocol, namely noninvasive in-vivo imaging and immune responses directed towards the antigen. All treatments were well tolerated, no safety drop-outs occurred. The fate of the model antigen OVA as well as the PLGA particles was monitored using a dual dye approach (CF660C & DiR) by multispectral fluorescence imaging (msFI). A depot effect for the OVA antigen adsorbed to the MP surface could be observed for the positively charged MPs. The immune response against OVA was then analyzed. OVA alone did not induce an immune response, whereas the positively charged as well as the neutral MP induced a strong and consistent humoral immune response with a clear favor of IgG1 over IgG2a subclass antibodies. In contrast, negatively charged MP were not able to induce measurable antibody responses. Cellular immune response was weak and inconsistent for all treated groups, which verifies previous in-vitro results conducted with the herein described microparticulate antigen platform. In conclusion, the characterization of the in-vivo performance yielded valuable information about antigen and carrier fate after application. The presented adjuvant platform is capable of inducing strong TH2 dominated immune responses characterized by enhanced IgG1 subclass titers which are critical for vaccines aimed at promoting induction of neutralizing antibodies.",29408551,2018,"Dual dye in-vivo imaging of differentially charged PLGA carriers reveals antigen-depot effect, leading to improved immune responses in preclinical models."
364,"Rats are widely used animal models for biological psychiatry and neuroscience. Laboratory rats are typically housed in impoverished sensory environments. The lack of species-typical sensory environment might radically change the response of individual animals to stressful and/or threatening episodes. In this report, we demonstrate that behavioral and neural sequelae of chronic stress were modified by sensory environment of adult male rats. This includes effects of stress on the density of spines on CA3 hippocampal neurons, hippocampal neurogenesis and abundance of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors. Enrichment also reduced depression-like behavior in a forced swim task. Stress and sensory enrichment evoked opposing effects on all the above endpoints. The sensory enrichment used in this report is of a relatively short duration provided during adulthood. This period excludes critical windows of greater plasticity during pre- and peripubertal stages. Our results suggest that standard housing practices for laboratory rats remain austere concerning sensory requirements of this species. Thus, even a moderate sensory enrichment is capable of reducing high stress-sensitivity and depressive-like behavior in standard laboratory rats.",29408681,2018,Housing environment influences stress-related hippocampal substrates and depression-like behavior.
365,"LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) was discovered almost 75 years ago, and has been the object of episodic controversy since then. While initially explored as an adjunctive psychiatric treatment, its recreational use by the general public has persisted and on occasion has been associated with adverse outcomes, particularly when the drug is taken under suboptimal conditions. LSD's potential to cause psychological disturbance (bad trips) has been long understood, and has rarely been associated with accidental deaths and suicide. From a physiological perspective, however, LSD is known to be non-toxic and medically safe when taken at standard dosages (50-200μg). The scientific literature, along with recent media reports, have unfortunately implicated ""LSD toxicity"" in five cases of sudden death. On close examination, however, two of these fatalities were associated with ingestion of massive overdoses, two were evidently in individuals with psychological agitation after taking standard doses of LSD who were then placed in maximal physical restraint positions (hogtied) by police, following which they suffered fatal cardiovascular collapse, and one case of extreme hyperthermia leading to death that was likely caused by a drug substituted for LSD with strong effects on central nervous system temperature regulation (e.g. 25i-NBOMe). Given the renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of LSD and other psychedelic drugs, it is important that an accurate understanding be established of the true causes of such fatalities that had been erroneously attributed to LSD toxicity, including massive overdoses, excessive physical restraints, and psychoactive drugs other than LSD.",29408722,2018,Is LSD toxic?
366,"Bloodstains and bloodstain patterns are often observed at crime scenes and their analysis through bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) can assist in reconstructing crime scenes. However, most published work related to BPA only deals with hard, non-porous surfaces and none of the studies have carefully characterized carpets. Soft and porous carpets are often encountered at crime scenes since they are common in American homes accounting for 51% of total U.S. flooring market; this has motivated the research described herein. To assess fluid penetration into tufted carpers, a new method for determining porosity and pore size distribution in tufted carpets has been developed for bloodstains on carpet. In this study, three kinds of nylon carpet were used: a low, a medium and a high face-weight carpet. Each carpet had an antistain treatment, which was removed from half of each carpet by steam-cleaning with a pH 12 NaOH solution. This resulted in six carpet samples. Yarn twist, carpet weight, pile height, water contact angles on carpets, water contact angles on individual fibers, and fiber cross-sectional shapes were characterized. Porosity and pore size distribution were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Porcine blood was used as a human blood substitute at three liquid volumes (30μL, 10μL, and 2μL). Analysis showed that porous carpet construction and antistain finishing both affected penetration. The depth of blood penetration decreased with the increase of carpet face-weight but increased with increased drop height. The removal of antistain treatment increased blood penetration into the carpets and changed the pore size distribution. Effects of antistain treatment, porosity and pore size distribution of tufted carpet, and blood wicking behaviors on carpets were found to strongly affect blood penetration into the carpets.",29408728,2018,Impact of carpet construction on fluid penetration: The case of blood.
367,"The number of elective abortions has been stable for several decades. Many factors explain women's choice of abortion in cases of unplanned pregnancies. Early initiation of contraceptive use and a choice of contraceptive choices appropriate to the woman's life are associated with lower rates of unplanned pregnancies. Reversible long-acting contraceptives should be favored as first-line methods for adolescents because of their effectiveness (grade C). Ultrasound scan before an elective abortion must be encouraged but should not be obligatory (professional consensus). As soon as the embryo appears on the ultrasound scan, the date of pregnancy is estimated by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) or, from 11 weeks on, by measuring the biparietal diameter (BPD) (grade A). Because reliability of these parameters is ±5 days, the abortion may be done if measurements are respectively less than 90 mm for CRL and less than 30 mm for BPD (professional consensus). A medically induced abortion, performed with a dose of 200 mg mifepristone combined with misoprostol, is effective at any gestational age (Level of Evidence (LE) 1). Before 7 weeks, mifepristone should be followed 24-48 h later by misoprostol, administered orally, buccally, sublingually, or even vaginally followed if needed by a further dose of 400 μg after 3 h, to be renewed if needed after 3 h (LE 1, grade A). After 7 weeks, administration of misoprostol by the vaginal, sublingual, or buccal routes is more effective and better tolerated than by the oral route (LE 1). Cervical preparation is recommended for systematic use in surgical abortions (professional consensus). Misoprostol is a first-line agent for cervical preparation at a dose of 400 μg (grade A). Vacuum aspiration is preferable to curettage (grade B). A uterus perforated during surgical aspiration should not routinely be considered to be scarred (professional consensus). An elective abortion is not associated with a higher risk of subsequent infertility or ectopic pregnancy (LE 2). The medical consultation before an elective abortion generally does not affect the decision to end or continue the pregnancy, and most women are sufficiently certain about their choice at this time. Women appear to find the method used most acceptable and to be most satisfied when they were able to choose the method (grade B). Elective abortions are not associated with an increased rate of psychiatric disorders (LE 2). However, women with psychiatric histories are at a higher risk of psychological disorders after the occurrence of an unplanned pregnancy than women with such a history (LE 2). For surgical abortions, combined hormonal contraceptives - oral or transdermal - should be started on the day of the abortion, while the vaginal ring should be inserted 5 days afterwards (grade B). For medical abortions, the vaginal ring should be inserted in the week after mifepristone administration, while the combined contraceptives should begin the same day as the misoprostol or the day after (grade C). Contraceptive implants should be inserted on the same day as a surgical abortion, and may be inserted the day the mifepristone is administered for medical abortions (grade B and C respectively). In case of medical abortion, the implant can be inserted the same day the mifepristone is administered (grade C). Both the copper IUDs and levonorgestrel intrauterine system should be inserted on the day of the surgical abortion (grade A). After medical abortions, an IUD can be inserted in 10 days after mifepristone administration, after ultrasound scan verification of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy (grade C).",29408754,2018,Elective abortion: Clinical practice guidelines from the French College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF).
368,"Substantial research into the brain dynamics underlying cognitive functioning during tasks links the brain's EEG activity to the stimulus-evoked ERP activity. This study focused on examining how the resting state intrinsic EEG, and the change from rest to the task, affect these stimulus-response processes. Forty young adults (aged 20.3 ± 2.3 years) had EEG recorded during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting states, and then during an auditory Go/NoGo task. Amplitude in the delta to beta bands was analyzed for the overall resting state EEG, the reactive change from EC to EO, and for the change from EO to the task (termed task-related change here). The relationships between these EEG measures and Go/NoGo behavioral outcomes and ERPs were assessed. Greater resting state delta and theta amplitudes were linked to Go N1-1 enhancements, but only resting state delta correlated with the NoGo N1-1. These relationships replicate previous data and highlight the functional relevance of low frequency intrinsic activity in attentional processes. However, delta increases from EO to the task predicted poorer Go response accuracy and variability, and enhanced Go Slow Wave (SW) positivity. This increase in delta, and smaller alpha-1 increments, were associated with longer mean RTs. Theta increases predicted larger Go N1-1 amplitudes, but lower NoGo accuracy rates, while beta-1 increments were predictive of NoGo SW negativity. These novel effects suggest that task-related EEG changes impact decision-making and cognitive control processes, and subsequent behavioral performance.",29409782,2018,Intrinsic EEG and task-related changes in EEG affect Go/NoGo task performance.
369,"INTRODUCTION
Cases of toxoplasmosis present in South America tend to be more severe than that found in other continents. Here, we present our clinical experience of ocular and ganglionar toxoplasmosis in the use of PCR, and of the treatment to prevent ocular involvement.


METHODOLOGY
Retrospective analysis of clinical charts of patients with ocular and lymphadenitic toxoplasmosis at the parasitology and tropical medicine consultation in the ""Universidad del Quindio"" in Colombia. In total, 91 records of cases with ocular toxoplasmosis and 17 with lymphadenitis that underwent PCR analysis for B1 repeated sequence in blood, were compared to the results of 104 people with chronic asymptomatic toxoplasmosis. In addition, 41 clinical records were included from patients with confirmed toxoplasmic lymphadenitis: 10 untreated, 6 that begun treatment after four months of symptoms, and 25 that were treated during the first four months of symptoms and had a follow-up during at least one year.


RESULTS
Patients with ocular toxoplasmosis or lymphadenitis had a higher probability of PCR positivity in peripheral blood than chronic asymptomatic people. There were no cases of retinochoroiditis in 25 patients with toxoplasmic lymphadenitis treated before 4 months of symptoms and followed during at least 12 months. In four out of ten untreated cases, new lesions of retinochoroiditis presented after the symptoms of lymphadenitis.


CONCLUSIONS
Toxoplasmosisin South America exhibits different clinical behavior and this influences the laboratory results as well as the need for treatment in the case of lymphadenitis. Clinicians should be aware of the geographical origin of the infection in order to adopt different therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.",29409823,2018,Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in ocular and ganglionar toxoplasmosis and the effect of therapeutics for prevention of ocular involvement in South American setting.
370,"Anxiety, trauma- and stressor-related disorders are severe psychiatric conditions that affect human population worldwide. Given their genetic tractability, evolutionarily conserved neurotransmitter systems, and extensive behavioral repertoire, zebrafish have become an emergent model organism in translational neuroscience. Here, we investigate whether a single exposure to conspecific alarm substance (CAS) produces fear conditioning in zebrafish using a conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm, as well as the persistence of aversive responses at different time intervals. While CAS elicited freezing and erratic movements at conditioning phase, zebrafish showed a robust avoidance for the CAS-paired compartment and increased risk assessment up to 7 days postconditioning. Additionally, we observed the existence of two behavioral phenotypes (high- and low-avoider fish) that present different fear-like responses at conditioning phase and evasion of the conditioning side at postconditioning trials. Collectively, we show a prolonged conditioned place aversion in zebrafish after a single CAS conditioning session, reinforcing the use of fear conditioning protocols as valuable strategies for modeling psychiatric disorders-related phenotypes in zebrafish.",29409977,2018,Extending the analysis of zebrafish behavioral endophenotypes for modeling psychiatric disorders: Fear conditioning to conspecific alarm response.
371,"Errors in human behavior elicit a cascade of brain activity related to performance monitoring and error detection. Whereas the early error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) has been assumed to reflect a fast mismatch or prediction error signal in the medial frontal cortex, the later error positivity (Pe) is viewed as a correlate of conscious error processing. A still open question is whether these components represent two independent systems of error monitoring that rely on different types of information to detect an error. Here, we investigated the prediction that the Ne/ERN but not the Pe requires a representation of the correct response to emerge. To this end, we created a condition in which no information about the correct response was available while error detection was still possible. We hypothesized that a Pe, but no Ne/ERN should be obtained in this case. Participants had to classify targets but ignore flankers that were always associated with an incorrect response. Targets but not flankers were masked with varying target-masking intervals. Crucially, on some trials no target at all was presented, thus preventing the representation of a correct response and the emergence of an Ne/ERN. However, because flankers were easily visible and responses to the flankers were always incorrect, detection of these flanker errors was still possible. In line with predictions of a multiple-systems account, we observed a robust Pe in the absence of an Ne/ERN for these errors. Moreover, this Pe relied on the same neural activity as that on trials with a visible target, as revealed by multivariate pattern analysis. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms reflected by the two components use different types of information to detect errors, providing evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.",29409999,2018,Errors can elicit an error positivity in the absence of an error negativity: Evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.
372,"The goal of childhood obesity lifestyle interventions are to positively change body composition, however it is unknown if interventions also modulate factors that are related to energy intake. This study aimed to examine changes in eating behaviors and plasma leptin concentrations in overweight and obese children participating in a 1-year family-centered lifestyle intervention. Interventions were based on Canadian diet and physical activity (PA) guidelines. Children were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: Control (Ctrl; no intervention), Standard treatment (StnTx: 2 servings milk and alternatives/day (d), 3x/wk weight-bearing PA), or Modified treatment (ModTx: 4 servings milk and alternatives/day; daily weight-bearing PA). Study visits occurred every 3-months for 1-y; interventions were held once a month for 6-months with one follow-up visit at 8-months. Ctrl received counselling after 1-y. Caregivers completed the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) and reported on diet and activity. Plasma leptin were measured from morning fasted blood samples. Seventy-eight children (mean age 7.8 ± 0.8 y; mean BMI 24.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated; 94% completed the study. Compared to baseline, at 6-months StnTx reduced Emotional Overeating and Desire to Drink scores (p < 0.05) while Food Responsiveness scores were reduced in both StnTx and ModTx (p < 0.05). At 1-year, scores for Desire to Drink in StnTx remained reduced compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Plasma leptin concentrations were significantly lower in ModTx at 6-months compared to baseline (p < 0.05). This study resulted in intervention groups favorably changing eating behaviors, supporting the use family-centered lifestyle interventions using Canadian diet and PA recommendations for children with obesity.",29410008,2018,Changes in eating behavior and plasma leptin in children with obesity participating in a family-centered lifestyle intervention.
373,"Based on cue reactivity theory, food cues embedded in media content can lead to physiological and psychological responses in children. Research suggests that unhealthy food cues are represented more extensively and interactively in children's media environments than healthy ones. However, it is not clear to this date whether children react differently to unhealthy compared to healthy food cues. In an experimental study with 56 children (55.4% girls; Mage = 8.00, SD = 1.58), we used eye-tracking to determine children's attention to unhealthy and healthy food cues embedded in a narrative cartoon movie. Besides varying the food type (i.e., healthy vs. unhealthy), we also manipulated the integration levels of food cues with characters (i.e., level of food integration; no interaction vs. handling vs. consumption), and we assessed children's individual susceptibility factors by measuring the impact of their hunger level. Our results indicated that unhealthy food cues attract children's visual attention to a larger extent than healthy cues. However, their initial visual interest did not differ between unhealthy and healthy food cues. Furthermore, an increase in the level of food integration led to an increase in visual attention. Our findings showed no moderating impact of hunger. We conclude that especially unhealthy food cues with an interactive connection trigger cue reactivity in children.",29410047,2018,A treat for the eyes.

374,"The permeabilization of biological membranes by electric fields, known as electroporation, has been traditionally performed with square electric pulses. These signals distribute the energy applied to cells in a wide frequency band. This paper investigates the use of sine waves, which are narrow band signals, to provoke electropermeabilization and the frequency dependence of this phenomenon. Single bursts of sine waves at different frequencies in the range from 8 kHz-130 kHz were applied to cells in vitro. Electroporation was studied in the plasma membrane and the internal organelles membrane using calcium as a permeabilization marker. Additionally, a double-shell electrical model was simulated to give a theoretical framework to our results. The electroporation efficiency shows a low pass filter frequency dependence for both the plasma membrane and the internal organelles membrane. The mismatch between the theoretical response and the observed behavior for the internal organelles membrane is explained by a two-step permeabilization process: first the permeabilization of the external membrane and afterwards that of the internal membranes. The simulations in the model confirm this two-step hypothesis when a variable plasma membrane conductivity is considered in the analysis. This study demonstrates how the use of narrow-band signals as sine waves is a suitable method to perform electroporation in a controlled manner. We suggest that the use of this type of signals could bring a simplification in the investigations of the very complex phenomenon of electroporation, thus representing an interesting option in future fundamental studies.",29410049,2018,Sine wave electropermeabilization reveals the frequency-dependent response of the biological membranes.
375,"In North America, more than 70 species of natural enemies are available for pest control, including the aphid predators, Adalia bipunctata L. (two-spotted lady beetle) and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville (convergent lady beetle), and the generalist predator Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (green lacewing). The two lady beetle species are known to host microsporidian pathogens: Nosema adaliae was originally described from Adalia bipunctata and Tubulinosema hippodamiae from H. convergens. Microsporidia are spore-forming pathogens that typically produce chronic, debilitating disease. Because the spores of both pathogens are transovarially transmitted through beetle eggs, the predation behavior of lacewing larvae provides an opportunity for the transmission of these pathogens when infected lady beetles and lacewings share the same local environment. In this study, uninfected and microsporidia-infected eggs from A. bipunctata and H. convergens were offered to C. carnea larvae. The development of larvae that consumed N. adaliae-infected eggs was not affected, but larval development was prolonged by almost 3 days for those that consumed two or more T. hippodamiae-infected eggs. Prolonged larval development is considered to be costly because larvae remain vulnerable to cannibalization by sibling larvae or other predators. Longevity did not differ significantly between sexes of C. carnea, and the sex ratio of newly eclosed adults did not differ from the previously reported sex ratio of 1♂: 1♀. Upon examination by light microscopy at the end of the trial, two C. carnea larvae were infected with N. adaliae and none were infected with T. hippodamiae, suggesting that T. hippodamiae influenced lacewing larval development without establishing an infection.",29410054,2018,"The influence of microsporidian pathogens from commercially available lady beetles on larval development of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, in the absence of infection."
376,"We tested the hypothesis that thermal behavior during the exercise recovery compensates for elevated core temperatures despite autonomic thermoeffector withdrawal. In a thermoneutral environment, 6 females and 6 males (22 ± 1 y) cycled for 60 min (225 ± 46 W metabolic heat production), followed by 60 min passive recovery. Mean skin and core temperatures, skin blood flow, and local sweat rate were measured continually. Subjects controlled the temperature of their dorsal neck to perceived thermal comfort using a custom-made neck device. Neck device temperature provided an index of thermal behavior. Mean body temperature, calculated as the average of mean skin and core temperatures, provided an index of the stimulus for thermal behavior. To isolate the independent effect of exercise on thermal behavior during recovery, data were analyzed post-exercise the exact minute mean body temperature recovered to pre-exercise levels within a subject. Mean body temperature returned to pre-exercise levels 28 ± 20 min into recovery (Pre: 33.5 ± 0.2, Post: 33.5 ± 0.2 °C, P = 0.20), at which point, mean skin temperature had recovered (Pre: 29.6 ± 0.4, Post: 29.5 ± 0.5 °C, P = 0.20) and core temperature (Pre: 37.3 ± 0.2, Post: 37.5 ± 0.3 °C, P = 0.01) remained elevated. Post-exercise, skin blood flow (Pre: 59 ± 78, Post: 26 ± 25 PU, P = 0.10) and local sweat rate (Pre: 0.05 ± 0.25, Post: 0.13 ± 0.14 mg/cm2 min-1, P = 0.09) returned to pre-exercise levels, while neck device temperature was depressed (Pre: 27.4 ± 1.1, Post: 21.6 ± 7.4 °C, P = 0.03).

377,"Anxiety is one of the most common mental states of humans. Although it drives us to avoid frightening situations and to achieve our goals, it may also impose significant suffering and burden if it becomes extreme. Because we experience anxiety in a variety of forms, previous studies investigated neural substrates of anxiety in a variety of ways. These studies revealed that individuals with high state, trait, or pathological anxiety showed altered neural substrates. However, no studies have directly investigated whether the different dimensions of anxiety share a common neural substrate, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we investigated a brain network of anxiety shared by different dimensions of anxiety in a unified analytical framework using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed different datasets in a single scale, which was defined by an anxiety-related brain network derived from whole brain. We first conducted the anxiety provocation task with healthy participants who tended to feel anxiety related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in their daily life. We found a common state anxiety brain network across participants (1585 trials obtained from 10 participants). Then, using the resting-state fMRI in combination with the participants' behavioral trait anxiety scale scores (879 participants from the Human Connectome Project), we demonstrated that trait anxiety shared the same brain network as state anxiety. Furthermore, the brain network between common to state and trait anxiety could detect patients with OCD, which is characterized by pathological anxiety-driven behaviors (174 participants from multi-site datasets). Our findings provide direct evidence that different dimensions of anxiety have a substantial biological inter-relationship. Our results also provide a biologically defined dimension of anxiety, which may promote further investigation of various human characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, from the perspective of anxiety.",29410078,2018,"A common brain network among state, trait, and pathological anxiety from whole-brain functional connectivity."
378,"The knowledge about effects of placebos and nocebos on specific visual attention processes is still very limited. In the present eye-tracking study, it was analyzed if a nocebo (sham transcranial magnetic stimulation) is able to elicit left-sided attentional deficits (pseudo-neglect). Fifty-two healthy participants performed a search task on the computer, once with and once without the nocebo. Indicators of left-biased search behavior (e.g. fixation count, reaction times for left vs. right-sided target detection) and affective state (e.g., valence, arousal) were assessed. The sample was divided into two groups (nocebo responder, non-responder) based on the experienced effectiveness of the nocebo. The nocebo treatment was associated with a positive and calm affective state. Contrary to the verbal suggestion, the nocebo increased the number of fixations and the dwell time on the left side of the computer screen. Moreover, the nocebo decreased the detection time for targets on the left side. These paradoxical nocebo effects were restricted to nocebo responders. Possible implications of nocebo-related compensatory behaviors for neuropsychological therapy are discussed.",29410091,2018,Nocebo and pseudo-neglect: Paradoxical effects detected with eye-tracking.
379,"Cognitive control of attention in conflict situations is a basic skill that is vital for goal-oriented behavior. Behavioral evidence shows that conflict control occurs over successive trials as well as longer time scales of trial blocks, but the relation among time scales as well as their neural mechanisms are unclear. This study used measures of behavior, EEG, and a simple quantitative model to test the hypothesis that conflict control at the block level is not exclusively driven by control adjustments over successive trials. Young adults performed an auditory Simon task, and the base rate of compatible vs. incompatible trials was manipulated in separate blocks (25, 50, 75% compatible). EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to define cortical mechanisms of any base rate and trial-by-trial sequence effects. Reaction time measures had both sequence and base rate effects. Two fronto-medial ICA components indexed sequence and base rate effects, with specific profiles for evoked potentials and oscillations in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Predictive modeling showed that sequence effects accounted for a minority of the variance on behavioral and ICA measures (all < 36%). The results strongly suggest that the base rate manipulation affected behavior and many neural measures beyond the influence of sequence effects.",29410123,2018,Cognitive control and midline theta adjust across multiple timescales.
380,"Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. However, how dopamine modulates the large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners, we investigated the effect of levodopa (l-dopa) on two aspects of cortical dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the functional connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in l-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, l-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. On the connectome level, however, l-dopa diminished functional integration across temporal and cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity in more than two thirds of the participants and to different degrees. Hypo-integration co-occurred with relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as posterior putamen. Both, l-dopa-induced BOLD signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individual's l-dopa-induced benefits in behavioral performance, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, l-dopa-induced modulations of BOLD signal variability were correlated with l-dopa-induced modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency. Our findings underline the role of dopamine in maintaining the dynamic range of, and communication between, cortical systems, and their explanatory power for inter-individual differences in benefits from dopamine during cognitive performance.",29410219,2018,Dopaminergic modulation of hemodynamic signal variability and the functional connectome during cognitive performance.
381,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in host metabolism and its dysregulation have been related to cardiometabolic disorders (CMD), such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension, as well as to chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The implication of the gut microbiota on systemic disorders has been associated with changes in its composition (dysbiosis) as a result of the oxidative unbalance in the body. This alteration may be the result of the adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behavior, including lack of physical activity and fat- or sugar-rich diets, which are largely associated with increased incidence of CMD and CKD. In last years, a number of clinical trials and experimental studies have demonstrated that probiotics can modulate the host metabolism, resulting in amelioration of systemic disease phenotypes by the improvement of dyslipidemia, glycemic profile and blood pressure or CKD parameters. The beneficial effects of probiotics consumption have been associated with their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and gut-modulating properties. Despite of some mechanistic evidence, these effects are not totally elucidated. The present review summarizes and clarifies the effects of probiotics administration on CMD and CKD using combined evidence from clinical and experimental studies. Considering that the microbiota dysregulation has been associated with inflammation and oxidative stress and consequently with CMD and CKD, supplementation with probiotics is discussed as a strategy for management of CMD and CKD.",29410236,2018,Gut microbiota and probiotics intervention: A potential therapeutic target for management of cardiometabolic disorders and chronic kidney disease?
382,"A cell's insoluble microenvironment has increasingly been shown to exert influence on its function. In particular, matrix stiffness and adhesiveness strongly impact behaviors such as cell spreading and differentiation, but materials that allow for independent control of these parameters within a fibrous, stromal-like microenvironment are very limited. In the current work, we devise a self-assembling peptide (SAP) system that facilitates user-friendly control of matrix stiffness and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) concentration within a hydrogel possessing a microarchitecture similar to stromal extracellular matrix. In this system, the RGD-modified SAP sequence KFE-RGD and the scrambled sequence KFE-RDG can be directly swapped for one another to change RGD concentration at a given matrix stiffness and total peptide concentration. Stiffness is controlled by altering total peptide concentration, and the unmodified base peptide KFE-8 can be included to further increase this stiffness range due to its higher modulus. With this tunable system, we demonstrate that human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and differentiation are influenced by both gel stiffness and the presence of functional cell binding sites in 3D culture. Specifically, cells 24 hours after encapsulation were only able to spread out in stiffer matrices containing KFE-RGD. Upon addition of soluble adipogenic factors, soft gels facilitated the greatest adipogenesis as determined by the presence of lipid vacuoles and PPARγ-2 expression, while increasing KFE-RGD concentration at a given stiffness had a negative effect on adipogenesis. This three-component hydrogel system thus allows for systematic investigation of matrix stiffness and RGD concentration on cell behavior within a fibrous, three-dimensional matrix.


STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
Physical cues from a cell's surrounding environment-such as the density of cell binding sites and the stiffness of the surrounding material-are increasingly being recognized as key regulators of cell function. Currently, most synthetic biomaterials used to independently tune these parameters lack the fibrous structure characteristic of stromal extracellular matrix, which can be important to cells naturally residing within stromal tissues. In this manuscript, we describe a 3D hydrogel encapsulation system that provides user-friendly control over matrix stiffness and binding site concentration within the context of a stromal-like microarchitecture. Binding site concentration and gel stiffness both influenced cell spreading and differentiation, highlighting the utility of this system to study the independent effects of these material properties on cell function.",29410241,2018,Independent control of matrix adhesiveness and stiffness within a 3D self-assembling peptide hydrogel.
383,"Schizophrenia is a severe behavioral syndrome of neurodevelopmental nature marked by primary or genuine motor abnormalities (GMA), which refer to spontaneous and medication-independent motor phenomena. Since motor dysfunction thus might be a consequence of events occurring during early childhood and adolescence, GMA can be detected in the period preceding manifest schizophrenia. However, the question whether motor system dysfunction might be a promising motor intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia remains unanswered. In this review, we systematically evaluate the evidence on GMA in healthy persons, individuals with schizotypal personality traits, persons at ultra-high risk for psychosis, and unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. What becomes evident is a continuum of GMA expression, which appears to be linked to abnormalities of cerebello-thalamo-cortical, fronto-parietal, and cortico-subcortical motor circuits. According to current evidence, motor dysfunction is a key aspect of the neurodevelopmental risk factor model of schizophrenia. Insights provided by this research will help promoting the RDoC Motor System construct and expand the clinical relevance of the motor domain in the period preceding manifest schizophrenia.",29410313,2018,Motor dysfunction as research domain in the period preceding manifest schizophrenia: A systematic review.
384,"BACKGROUND
Classic hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis inevitably causes hemitongue atrophy and dysfunction. Thus, many variants have been developed to reduce tongue-related morbidities. A comparative study concerning these techniques was conducted in rats to systematically evaluate long-term functional and histologic outcomes of the recipient and donor systems.


METHODS
Rats (8 per group) were treated by end-to-end neurorrhaphy (EEN), EEN using the hemisectioned and longitudinally split donor nerve (EEN-Hemi), end-to-side neurorrhaphy through a perineurial window (ESN-PW), or 30% to 40% partial neurotomy (ESN-PN). Four additional rats were left intact. At 8 months postoperatively, behavioral, electrophysiologic, and morphologic studies were carried out to compare the groups.


RESULTS
All techniques resulted in partial functional recovery, but complete restoration was not obtained. There were no significant differences between the experimental groups in axon diameter or myelin thickness. The facial nerve fiber count after ESN-PN, but not after EEN-Hemi or ESN-PW, was comparable with that after EEN, which agreed with the behavioral and electrophysiologic results. The hypoglossal nerve fiber count after ESN-PN was slightly less than that after ESN-PW, but markedly more than that after EEN-Hemi, corresponding to the electrophysiologic examination. Quantitative measures of muscle fiber cross-sectional area and connective tissue area density of the tongue demonstrated severe muscle atrophy on the operated side after EEN and EEN-Hemi when compared with ESN-PW and ESN-PN.

A state of the art pH responsive nanoparticles (NPs) MSNs-PAA consisting of mesoporous silica nanoparticles core and polymeric shell layers, were developed for controlled release of model anti-cancer drug ETS. Graft onto strategy was employed and amination served as an interim step, laying a vital foundation for functionalization of the MSN core with hydrophilic and pH responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA). MCM-41-PAA were investigated as carriers for loading and regulated release of ETS at different pH for the first time. The PAA-MSNs contained 20.19% grafted PAA as exhibited by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which enormously improved the solubility of ETS in aqueous media. The synthesized PAA-MSNs were characterized by various techniques viz, SEM-EDS, TEM, BET, FT-IR and powder XRD. ETS was effectively loaded into the channels of PAA-MSN via electrostatic interactions. The cumulative release was much rapid at extracellular tumor (6.8) and endosomal pH (5.5) than that of blood pH (7.4). Hemolysis study was done for the prepared NPs. MTT assay results showed that the drug-loaded ETS-MCM-41-PAA NPs were more cytotoxic to both prostate cancer cells namely PC-3 and LNCaP than free ETS, which was attributed to their slow and sustained release behavior.

Using questionnaire and diagnostic interview data, parent and teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and ASD of 57 VP-children (mean age = 9.2 years) were compared with 57 gender and age matched full-term children using t-tests. Intra-class correlation coefficients quantified parent-teacher agreement. Correlation analysis investigated co-occurrence of ADHD/ASD symptoms. ADHD/ASD measures were aggregated using principal component analysis. Regression analyses investigated the contribution of perinatal risk factors, sex and SES to ADHD/ASD symptoms.


RESULTS
VP-children showed higher levels of parent and teacher reported attention problems, social impairment and compromised communication skills. Fair to strong agreement was found between parent and teacher reported ADHD and ASD symptoms, indicating pervasiveness of observed difficulties. Co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD symptoms in VP-children was found. Lower gestational age was associated with higher ADHD and ASD symptom levels, male sex with higher ADHD symptom levels and lower SES with higher ASD symptom levels.


CONCLUSION
School-age VP-children show higher levels of ADHD and ASD symptoms, and attention, socialization and communication difficulties in particular. Routinely screening for these problems is recommended in follow-up care.",29413425,2018,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder symptoms in school-age children born very preterm.
389,"BACKGROUND
For the evaluation of macromolecular drug delivery systems suitable pre-clinical monitoring of potential nanocarrier systems is needed. In this regard, both short-term as well as long-term in vivo tracking is crucial to understand structure-property relationships of polymer carrier systems and their resulting pharmacokinetic profile. Based on former studies revealing favorable in vivo characteristics for 18F-labeled random (ran) copolymers consisting of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) and lauryl methacrylate (LMA) - including prolonged plasma half-life as well as enhanced tumor accumulation - the presented work focuses on their long-term investigation in the living organism.


METHODS
In this respect, four different HPMA-based polymers (homopolymers as well as random copolymers with LMA as hydrophobic segment) were synthesized and subsequent radioactive labeling was accomplished via the longer-lived radioisotope 131I. In vivo results, concentrating on the pharmacokinetics of a high molecular weight HPMA-ran-LMA copolymer, were obtained by means of biodistribution and metabolism studies in the Walker 256 mammary carcinoma model over a time-span of up to three days. Besides, a direct comparison with the 18F-radiolabeled polymer was drawn. To consider physico-chemical differences between the differently labeled polymer (18F or 131I) on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the size of the polymeric micelles, those properties were determined using the 19F- or 127I-functionalized polymer. Special emphasis was laid on the time-dependent correlation between blood circulation properties and corresponding tumor accumulation, particularly regarding the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.


RESULTS
Studies revealed, at first, differences in the short time (2h) body distribution, despite the very similar properties (molecular structure, CMC and size of the micellar aggregates) of the non-radioactive 19F- and 127I-functionalized polymers. Long-term investigations with the 131I-labeled polymer demonstrated that, despite a polymer clearance from the blood within 72h, there was still an increase in tumor uptake observed over time. Regarding the stability of the 131I-label, ex vivo biodistribution experiments, considering the uptake in the thyroid, indicated low metabolism rates.


CONCLUSION
The observed in vivo characteristics strongly underline the EPR effect. The findings illustrate the need to combine information of different labeling approaches and in vivo evaluation techniques to generate an overall pharmacokinetic picture of potential nanocarriers in the pre-clinical setting.

390,"Pulmonary surfactant forms a cohesive film at the alveolar air-lung interface, lowering surface tension, and thus reducing the work of breathing and preventing atelectasis. Surfactant function becomes impaired during inflammation due to degradation of the surfactant lipids and proteins by free radicals. In this study, we examine the role of reactive nitrogen (RNS) and oxygen (ROS) species on surfactant function with and without physiological cholesterol levels (5-10%). Surface activity was assessed in vitro in a captive bubble surfactometer (CBS). Surfactant chemistry, monolayer fluidity and thermodynamic behavior were also recorded before and after oxidation. We report that physiologic amounts of cholesterol combined with oxidation results in severe impairment of surfactant function. We also show that surfactant polyunsaturated phospholipids are the most susceptible to oxidative alteration. Membrane thermodynamic experiments showed significant surfactant film stiffening after free radical exposure in the presence of cholesterol. These results point to a previously unappreciated role for cholesterol in amplifying defects in surface activity caused by oxidation of pulmonary surfactant, a finding that may have implications for treating several lung diseases.",29413906,2018,Dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant mediated by phospholipid oxidation is cholesterol-dependent.
391,"BACKGROUND
Ophthalmic acid (OPH), γ-glutamyl-L-2-aminobutyryl-glycine, a tripeptide analogue of glutathione (GSH), has recently captured considerable attention as a biomarker of oxidative stress in animals. The OPH and GSH biosynthesis, as well as some biochemical behaviors, are very similar. Here, we sought to investigate the presence of OPH in plants and its possible relationship with GSH, known to possess multiple functions in the plant development, growth and response to environmental changes.


METHODS
HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was used to examine the occurrence of OPH in leaves from various plant species, and flours from several plant seeds. Different types of oxidative stress, i.e., water, dark, paraquat, and cadmium stress, were induced in rye, barley, oat, and winter wheat leaves to evaluate the effects on the levels of OPH and its metabolic precursors.


RESULTS
OPH and its dipeptide precursor, γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyric acid, were found to occur in phylogenetically distant plants. Interestingly, the levels of OPH were tightly associated with the oxidative stress tested. Levels of OPH precursors, γ-glutamyl-2-aminobutyric acid and 2-aminobutyric acid, the latter efficiently formed in plants via biosynthetic pathways absent in the animal kingdom, were also found to increase during oxidative stress.


CONCLUSIONS
OPH occurs in plants and its levels are tightly associated with oxidative stress.

392,"Acrylic pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are widely used in transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS). However, there was little research about the quantitative relationship between drug release and drug-PSAs interaction. In this study, five acrylic PSAs with different molar fraction of carboxyl group were designed and synthesized. Propranolol (PRO) was used as model drug to evaluate release profiles in the PSAs in vitro and in vivo. The drug release percent in the PSAs were 81.66, 78.22, 51.66, 21.81 and 11.73%, and their release behaviors were decreased with carboxyl group content of PSAs. Furthermore, it was found that quantity of carboxyl group of PSAs was equal to residual drug by the quantitative determination. In addition, the ionic interaction between PRO and PSAs was confirmed by FT-IR and MDSC results qualitatively. Using the FT-IR, MDSC, Flory-Huggins interaction parameters and molecular dynamic simulation, interaction strength between drug and PSAs was determined quantitatively, which demonstrated that the drug release amount decreased linearly with interaction strength. Based on above results, we proposed that the PRO was possibly binding to the carboxyl group of PSAs one-by-one, which provided references for the accurate design of TDDS.",29414309,2018,The role of carboxyl group of pressure sensitive adhesive in controlled release of propranolol in transdermal patch: Quantitative determination of ionic interaction and molecular mechanism characterization.
393,"BACKGROUND
Adolescents with fixed orthodontic appliances are at high risk of developing dental caries. To date, new smartphone technologies have seldom been used to support them in the preventive behavior that can help prevent dental caries. After an intervention-mapping process, we developed a smartphone application (the WhiteTeeth app) for preventing dental caries through improved oral-health behavior and oral hygiene. The app, which is intended to be used at home, will help adolescents with fixed orthodontic appliances perform their oral self-care behavior. The app is based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) theory, and incorporates several behavior-change techniques that target the psychosocial factors of oral-health behavior. This article describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of the WhiteTeeth app on oral-health behavior and oral-hygiene outcomes (presence of dental plaque and gingival bleeding) compared with those of care as usual, in patients aged 12-16 with fixed orthodontic appliances.


METHODS/DESIGN
The RCT has two conditions: an experimental group that will receive the WhiteTeeth app in addition to care as usual, and a control group that will only receive care as usual. Care as usual will include routine oral-health education and instruction at orthodontic check-ups. In the western part of the Netherlands 146 participants will be recruited from four orthodontic clinics. Data will be collected during three orthodontic check-ups: baseline (T0), 6 weeks of follow-up (T1) and 12 weeks of follow-up (T2). The primary study outcomes are the presence of dental plaque (measured with a modified Silness and Loë Plaque Index); and gingival bleeding (measured with the Bleeding on Marginal Probing Index). Secondary outcomes include changes in self-reported oral-health behaviors and its psychosocial factors identified by the HAPA theory, such as outcome expectancies, intention, action self-efficacy, coping planning and action control.


DISCUSSION
Since the intervention was designed to target psychosocial factors in the motivational and volitional components of the behavior-change process, we hypothesize that the app will cause greater improvements in oral-health behavior and oral hygiene more than traditional oral-health-promotion programs (i.e., care as usual).

394,"Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit unparalleled anion exchange properties and the ability to be exfoliated into 2D nanosheets, which can be used as a building block to fabricate a wide variety of hybrid functional nanostructured materials. Still, if one wants to use LDHs as a magnetic building blocks in the design of complex architectures, the role played by the dipolar magnetic interactions in these layered materials needs to be understood. In this work, we synthesized and characterized a five-membered CoAl-LDH series with basal spacing ranging from 7.5 to 34 Å. A detailed experimental characterization allows us to conclude that the main factor governing the dipolar interactions between magnetic layers cannot be the interlayer spacing. Supporting theoretical modeling suggests instead a relevant role for spin correlation size, which, in the limit, is related to the lateral dimension of the layer. These results highlight the importance of cation ordering in the magnetic behavior of LDHs, and underpin the differences with homometallic-layered hydroxides.",29419288,2018,Deciphering the Role of Dipolar Interactions in Magnetic Layered Double Hydroxides.

Treating either with N3DIPP (DIPP = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) formed uranium(IV) mono(imido) complexes, CpPU(NDIPP)(MesPDIMe) (2-CpP) and Cp*U(NDIPP)(MesPDIMe) (2-Cp*), featuring reduced [MesPDIMe]-. The addition of electron-donating 1-azidoadamantane (N3Ad) to 1-Cp* generated a dimeric product, [Cp*U(NAd)(MesHPDIMe)]2 (3), from radical coupling at the p-pyridine position of the pyridine(diimine) ligand and H-atom abstraction, formed through a monomeric intermediate that was observed in solution but could not be isolated. To support this, Cp*U(tBu-MesPDIMe)(THF) (1-tBu), which has a tert-butyl group protecting the para position, was also treated with N3Ad, and the monomeric product, Cp*U(NAd)(tBu-MesPDIMe) (2-tBu), was isolated.

This complex represents the first example of dinuclear FeII complex with double μ-κN:κS-SCN bridges in a head-to-tail configuration that exhibits ferromagnetic coupling between metal ions (JFeFe = +1.08 cm-1). Experimental and theoretical magnetostructural studies on this kind of infrequent FeII dinuclear complex containing a centrosymmetrically [Fe2(μ-SCN)2] bridging fragment show that the magnitude and sign of the magnetic coupling parameter, JFeFe, depend to a large extent on the Fe-N-C (α) angle, so that JFeFe decreases linearly when α decreases. The calculated crossover point below which the magnetic interactions change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic is found at 162.3°. In addition, experimental results obtained in this work and those reported in the literature suggest that large Ntripodal-FeII distances and bent N-bound terminal κN-SCN ligands favor the high spin state of the FeII ions, while short Ntripodal-FeII distances and almost linear Fe-N-C angles favor a stronger ligand field, which enables the FeII ions to show spin crossover (SCO) behavior.",29420016,2018,On the Magnetic Coupling and Spin Crossover Behavior in Complexes Containing the Head-to-Tail [FeII2(μ-SCN)2] Bridging Unit: A Magnetostructural Experimental and Theoretical Study.
397,"Abrupt discontinuation of chronic amphetamine consumption leads to withdrawal symptoms including depression, anhedonia, dysphoria, fatigue, and anxiety. These irritating symptoms may result in continuing to take the drug or can lead to suicidal behavior. Past studies have shown the involvement of various biologic systems in depression induced following amphetamine withdrawal (AW). However, there is no evidence about the relation between nitric oxide (NO) with NMDA receptors on depression following AW. In this study, we examined the involvement of the NO/NMDA pathways on depressive-like behaviors after 24 h withdrawal following 5 continuous days of amphetamine administration in male NMRI mice. Behavioral tasks used for depression assessment included the forced swimming test (FST), the Splash test and the open field test (OFT). In order to evaluate the role of NO/NMDA pathways animals treated with MK-801 (NMDA-R antagonist), Aminoguanidine (AG), a selective iNOS inhibitor, Nω-Nitro-l-arginine (L-NNA), a non-selective NOS inhibitor and 7-Nitro indazole (7-NI), a selective nNOS inhibitor. We also measured the level of nitrite in the hippocampus. Our data showed that AW induced the depressive-like effect in the FST and the Splash test. We showed that administration of AG, L-NNA, and MK-801 mitigated AW induced depression, however, 7-NI was failed to decrease depressive-like behaviors. Also, the antidepressant-like effect of co-injection of sub-effective doses of MK-801 with AG suggested that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is associated with NMDA-R in AW induced depression. In conclusion, both NO and NMDA-R pathways are involved and related to each other in depression induced following AW.",29421244,2018,Involvement of NO/NMDA-R pathway in the behavioral despair induced by amphetamine withdrawal.
398,"The studies for the effects of stress on drug addiction were mostly obtained using sequential exposure to stress and drugs. However, few studies have been conducted on the effects of simultaneous exposure to stress and methamphetamine (METH) on METH-induced reward effects and behavioral sensitization. Thus, we examined the effects of simultaneous exposure to restraint stress and METH on METH-induced addictive behaviors using conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. During the conditioning period, the mice were exposed to 2 h restraint stress before administration of METH or saline for 4 days. To investigate the effect of restraint stress on drug relapse, the mice were exposed to 2 h of restraint stress for 4 days during the late period of withdrawal. The results showed that the acquisition of METH CPP was impaired by simultaneous exposure to restraint stress and METH administration and the impairment of METH CPP was retained until METH-induced reinstatement. Additionally, based on locomotor activity data measured during METH reinstatement, simultaneous stress exposure during the conditioning phase increased METH-induced locomotor sensitization. We also found that the magnitude of METH-primed relapse was reduced in mice exposed to restraint stress during the late period of withdrawal. Taken together, these findings suggest that simultaneous exposure to restraint stress and METH can reduce the acquisition and relapse of METH-induced addictive behaviors but not behavioral sensitization.",29421246,2018,Repeated restraint stress reduces the acquisition and relapse of methamphetamine-conditioned place preference but not behavioral sensitization.
399,"In mammals, environmental factors including cold stress exert dramatic effects on adult health during late gestation, the cold stress response refers to an organism's response to cold. Indeed, cells and organs, including the hippocampus, are coordinated to respond to prevent hypothermia. The hippocampus act as an important brain structure that regulates the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and suppress the stress reaction through feedback regulation of the HPA axis. To evaluate the response of the hippocampus during prenatal cold stress, we established a prenatal cold stress rat model. The molecular and signaling pathways responsible for the hippocampus cold exposure response were investigated. We assessed the glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3), heat shock protein 70, protein expression, and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor-kappa B pathways. Male and female offspring behavior were evaluated. Cold stress reduced the BDNF level in the maternal hippocampus in contrast to the increase in RBM3. BDNF has been shown to induce and RBM3 inhibits ERK phosphorylation. We measured p-ERK1/2 and showed low-level phosphorylation in the hippocampus after cold stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cold stress enhanced phosphorylation of P65 on Ser536, and led to apoptosis of the hippocampus in a caspase 3-independent manner. Behavioral tests were performed on pubescent male and female offspring, both of which showed evidence of reduced anxiety-like behavior. In summary, a more thorough understanding of these mechanisms may lead to maternal intervention that can reverse the damage of prenatal stressors or prevent the damage altogether and improve the physical quality of neonatal rats.",29421306,2018,Prenatal cold stress: Effect on maternal hippocampus and offspring behavior in rats.
400,"Proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H fMRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique capable of detecting dynamic changes in glutamate related to task-related demands at a temporal resolution under 1 min. Several recent 1H fMRS studies demonstrated elevated steady-state levels of glutamate of 2% or greater during different 'task-active' conditions, relative to a 'non-task-active' control condition. However, the 'control' condition from these studies does vary with respect to the degree of constraining behavior, which may lead to different glutamate levels or variability between 'control' conditions. The purpose of this 1H fMRS study was to compare the steady-state levels and variability of glutamate in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of 16 healthy adults across four different putative 'non-task-active' conditions: relaxed with eyes closed, passive visual fixation crosshair, visual flashing checkerboard, and finger tapping. Results showed significantly lower glutamate levels during the passive visual fixation crosshair than the visual flashing checkerboard and the finger tapping conditions. Moreover, glutamate was significantly less variable during the passive visual fixation crosshair and the visual flashing checkerboard than the relaxed eyes closed condition. Of the four conditions, the passive visual fixation crosshair condition demonstrated the lowest and least variable glutamate levels potentially reflecting the least dlPFC engagement, but greatest behavioral constraint. These results emphasize the importance of selecting a proper 'control' condition to reflect accurately a 'non-task-active' steady-state level of glutamate with minimal variability during 1H MRS investigations.",29421322,2018,Differences in steady-state glutamate levels and variability between 'non-task-active' conditions: Evidence from 1H fMRS of the prefrontal cortex.
401,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) that causes a dopamine (DA) deficit in the caudate-putamen (CPu) accompanied by compensatory changes in other neurotransmitter systems. These changes result in severe motor and non-motor symptoms. To disclose the role of various receptor binding sites for DA, noradrenaline, and serotonin in the hemiparkinsonian (hemi-PD) rat model induced by unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection, the densities of D1, D2/D3, α1, α2, and 5HT2A receptors were longitudinally visualized and measured in the CPu of hemi-PD rats by quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. We found a moderate increase in D1 receptor density 3 weeks post lesion that decreased during longer survival times, a significant increase of D2/D3 receptor density, and 50% reduction in 5HT2A receptor density. α1 receptor density remained unaltered in hemi-PD and α2 receptors demonstrated a slight right-left difference increasing with post lesion survival. In a second step, the possible role of receptors on the known reduction of apomorphine-induced rotations in hemi-PD rats by intrastriatally injected Botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A) was analyzed by measuring the receptor densities after BoNT-A injection. The application of this neurotoxin reduced D2/D3 receptor density, whereas the other receptors mainly remained unaltered. Our results provide novel data for an understanding of the postlesional plasticity of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic receptors in the hemi-PD rat model. The results further suggest a therapeutic effect of BoNT-A on the impaired motor behavior of hemi-PD rats by reducing the interhemispheric imbalance in D2/D3 receptor density.",29421436,2018,"Dopamine, Noradrenaline and Serotonin Receptor Densities in the Striatum of Hemiparkinsonian Rats following Botulinum Neurotoxin-A Injection."
402,"During extended observation of estrogen receptor (ER) α-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus, we previously identified a novel nucleus, the Sagittalis Nucleus of the Hypothalamus (SGN), in the interstitial area between the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The SGN exhibits sexual dimorphism in its volume and cell count, and estrous cycle related variations in ERα-immunoreactivity. These characteristics of the SGN implicate the nucleus in sex-biased brain functions and behaviors. In this study, we examined involvement of the SGN in sexual arousal in female rats. Immunohistochemical staining of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity was performed after administration of an estrus-inducing dose of estrogen and progesterone in ovariectomized female rats. Analysis of microscopic images showed a significant increase in the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the SGN following hormonal manipulation. Moreover, neuronal activity in the region exhibited a further increase after each animal was coupled with a male and allowed to mate. These results suggest that the SGN plays an important role in sexual activity in female rat.",29421537,2018,Neuronal activity in the sagittalis nucleus of the hypothalamus after ovarian steroid hormone manipulation and sexual behavior in female rat.
403,"BACKGROUND
Crack-cocaine is an important public health problem in Brazil and worldwide. It is a potent form of cocaine which results in rapid and damaging stimulating effects on the central nervous system through inhibition of the dopamine transporter. Some studies have suggested that both food and drugs - including crack, can act on the same brain reward mechanisms, altering the dopamine pathways that modulate behavioral responses. Our hypothesis was that leptin, a well-known peptide that modulates energy metabolism and appetite, can be used as a biomarker for drug use.


METHODS
Anthropometric data, drug use profiles, and leptin serum levels were evaluated in a cross-sectional study of 40 crack-cocaine users.


RESULTS
Leptin showed an inverse correlation with the severity of crack use, and this correlation remained when corrected by body mass index (BMI) and body composition by bioimpedance (BIA). The majority of subjects were eutrophic or overweight/obese considering BMI and BIA, and these variables were not significantly associated with the severity of crack use, but positively correlated with leptin levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Our preliminary findings suggest that leptin could be involved in drug use severity, perhaps through pathways similar to those whereby it modulates food intake. Considering the anthropometric parameters, these findings provide additional evidence that low weight is not predominant in crack users.",29421542,2018,Leptin levels and its correlation with crack-cocaine use severity: A preliminary study.
404,"Extensive studies have been performed to understand how the mechanical properties of a stem cell's microenvironment influence its behaviors. Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), a well-known biomimetic platform, have been used to mimic the dynamic characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) because of their fluidity. However, the effect of the fluidity of SLBs on stem cell fate is unknown. We constructed SLBs with different fluidities to explore the influence of fluidity on the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). The results showed that the behavior of NSCs was highly dependent on the fluidity of SLBs. Low fluidity resulted in enhanced focal adhesion formation, a dense network of stress fibers, stretched and elongated cellular morphology and increased neuronal differentiation, while high fluidity led to less focal adhesion formation, immature stress fibers, round cellular morphology and more astrocyte differentiation. Mechanistic studies revealed that low fluidity may have enhanced focal adhesion formation, which activated FAK-MEK/ERK signaling pathways and ultimately promoted neuronal differentiation of NSCs. This work provides a strategy for manipulating the dynamic matrix surface for the development of culture substrates and tissue-engineered scaffolds, which may aid the understanding of how the dynamic ECM influences stem cell behaviors as well as improve the efficacy of stem cell applications.",29421547,2018,Lower fluidity of supported lipid bilayers promotes neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells by enhancing focal adhesion formation.
405,"Intracortical microelectrode arrays, especially the Utah array, remain the most common choice for obtaining high dimensional recordings of spiking neural activity for brain computer interface and basic neuroscience research. Despite the widespread use and established design, mechanical, material and biological challenges persist that contribute to a steady decline in recording performance (as evidenced by both diminished signal amplitude and recorded cell population over time) or outright array failure. Device implantation injury causes acute cell death and activation of inflammatory microglia and astrocytes that leads to a chronic neurodegeneration and inflammatory glial aggregation around the electrode shanks and often times fibrous tissue growth above the pia along the bed of the array within the meninges. This multifaceted deleterious cascade can result in substantial variability in performance even under the same experimental conditions. We track both impedance signatures and electrophysiological performance of 4 × 4 floating microelectrode Utah arrays implanted in the primary monocular visual cortex (V1m) of Long-Evans rats over a 12-week period. We employ a repeatable visual stimulation method to compare signal-to-noise ratio as well as single- and multi-unit yield from weekly recordings. To explain signal variability with biological response, we compare arrays categorized as either Type 1, partial fibrous encapsulation, or Type 2, complete fibrous encapsulation and demonstrate performance and impedance signatures unique to encapsulation type.

406,"Epidemiological studies suggest that a single moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD). Histopathological studies describe complex neurodegenerative pathologies in individuals exposed to single moderate-to-severe TBI or repetitive mild TBI, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the clinicopathological links between TBI and post-traumatic neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD, and CTE remain poorly understood. Here we describe the methodology of the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI) study, whose goals are to characterize chronic post-traumatic neuropathology and to identify in vivo biomarkers of post-traumatic neurodegeneration. LETBI participants undergo extensive clinical evaluation using National Institutes of Health TBI Common Data Elements, proteomic and genomic analysis, structural and functional MRI, and prospective consent for brain donation. Selected brain specimens undergo ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI and histopathological evaluation including whole mount analysis. Co-registration of ex vivo and in vivo MRI data enables identification of ex vivo lesions that were present during life. In vivo signatures of postmortem pathology are then correlated with cognitive and behavioral data to characterize the clinical phenotype(s) associated with pathological brain lesions. We illustrate the study methods and demonstrate proof of concept for this approach by reporting results from the first LETBI participant, who despite the presence of multiple in vivo and ex vivo pathoanatomic lesions had normal cognition and was functionally independent until her mid-80s. The LETBI project represents a multidisciplinary effort to characterize post-traumatic neuropathology and identify in vivo signatures of postmortem pathology in a prospective study.",29421973,2018,Multimodal Characterization of the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI): A Methodological Overview of the LETBI Project.
407,"The extent to which N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors facilitate the motivation to voluntarily wheel-run in rodents has yet to be determined. In so, we utilized female Wistar rats selectively bred to voluntarily run high (HVR) and low (LVR) nightly distances in order to examine if endogenous differences in nucleus accumbens (NAc) NMDA receptor expression and function underlies the propensity for high or low motivation to voluntarily wheel-run. 12-14 week old HVR and LVR females were used to examine: 1.) NAc mRNA and protein expression of NMDA subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B; 2.) NMDA current responses in isolated medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and 3.) NMDA-evoked dopamine release in an ex vivo preparation of NAc punches. Expectedly, there was a large divergence in nightly running distance and time between HVR and LVR rats. We saw a significantly higher mRNA and protein expression of NR1 in HVR compared to LVR rats, while seeing no difference in the expression of NR2A or NR2B. There was a greater current response to a 500 ms application of 300 μM of NMDA in medium-spiny neurons isolated from the NAc HVR compared to LVR animals. On average, NMDA-evoked punches (50 μM of NMDA for 10 min) taken from HVR rats retained ∼54% of the dopamine content compared to their bilateral non-evoked sides, while evoked punches from LVR animals showed no statistical decrease in dopamine content compared to their non-evoked sides. Collectively, these data suggest a potential link between NAc NR1 subunit expression as well as NMDA function and the predisposition for nightly voluntary running behavior in rats. In light of the epidemic rise in physical inactivity, these findings have the potential to explain a neuro-molecular mechanism that regulates the motivation to be physically active.",29425730,2018,High and low nightly running behavior associates with nucleus accumbens N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) NR1 subunit expression and NMDAR functional differences.

Seven-day-old rats with hypoxia ischemic brain damage (HIBD) from the left carotid ligation procedure plus 2 h hypoxic stress (8% O2 at 37 °C) were further receiving repeated mild hypoxia intermittently. The gross anatomy, functional analyses, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) expression, and neuronal apoptosis of the rat brains were subsequently examined. Compared to the HIBD group, rats postconditioned with mild hypoxia had elevated HIF-1a expression, more Nissl-stain positive cells in their brain tissue and their brains functioned better in behavioral analyses. The recovery of the brain function may be directly linked to the inhibitory effect of HIF-1α on neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, there were significantly less neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region of the rats postconditioned with mild hypoxia, which might also be related to the higher HIF-1a expression and better brain performance. Overall, these results suggested that postconditioning of neonatal rats after HIBD with mild hypoxia increased HIF-1a expression, exerted a neuroprotective effect and promoted neural functional recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
Repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning protects neonatal rats with HIBD against brain damage and improves neural functional recovery. Our results may have clinical implications for treating infants with HIBD.",29425795,2018,Postconditioning with repeated mild hypoxia protects neonatal hypoxia-ischemic rats against brain damage and promotes rehabilitation of brain function.
409,"Cannabinoids (CBs) play important roles in pain modulation. Recently, VD-hemopressin(β) [VD-Hpβ], a 12-residue β-hemoglobin-derived peptide, was reported to activate both CB1 and CB2 receptors in vitro. To further characterize in vivo actions of VD-Hpβ, its antinociceptive activity and site(s) were evaluated in the mouse tail-flick test, and supraspinal antinociception of VD-Hpβ was further assessed in the writhing test. Our results demonstrated that supraspinal, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administrations of VD-Hpβ produced analgesia in the tail-flick test. When given at the same levels, the CB1 antagonist AM251, rather than the CB2 antagonist AM630 diminished VD-Hpβ-induced antinociception. Furthermore, our results indicated that supraspinal, intrathecal or subcutaneous pretreatment with AM251 significantly inhibited VD-Hpβ-induced systemic antinociception. In the writhing test, supraspinal VD-Hpβ inhibited pain-related behaviors, which was partially prevented by AM251. Notably, supraspinal administration of VD-Hpβ failed to affect motor function at the antinociceptive doses. These findings suggest that VD-Hpβ induces CB1 receptor-mediated antinociception in tail-flick test in various routes of administration, and its systemic antinociception is mediated by both central and peripheral CB1 receptor. In addition, VD-Hpβ produces analgesic activity in the writhing test, which is at least partially mediated by CB1 receptor. Therefore, our present animal models show a CB1 agonistic character of VD-Hpβ, an endogenous cannabinoid peptide.",29425797,2018,Antinociceptive effects of the endogenous cannabinoid peptide agonist VD-hemopressin(β) in mice.
410,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE
Da Chuanxiong Formula (DCXF) is one of the famous herb pairs that contains dried rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. and Gastrodia elata Bl. in the mass ratio of 4:1. This classic representative traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat brain diseases like headache and migraine caused by blood stasis and wind pathogen. However, the therapeutic effect of DCXF on traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been reported yet.


AIM OF STUDY
The present study was performed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DCXF and its underlying mechanisms in the controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced TBI rat model.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Sham, TBI control, 1X DCXF (520.6 mg/kg) and 5X DCXF (2603.0 mg/kg). Two treatment groups (1X and 5X DCXF) were intragastrically administered daily for 7 days before CCI-induced TBI and then DCXF treatments were continued post-TBI until the animal behavioral tests, including Morris water maze test, acceleration rotarod motor test and CatWalk quantitative gait analysis test, were done. The brain water content and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured by wet-dry weight method and Evans blue method, respectively. The number of neuron cells, neural stem cells (NSCs), GFAP positive cells (astrocyte) as well as Iba-1 positive cells (microglia) were determined by histology and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Treatment with DCXF significantly improved the learning ability and memory retention in Morris water maze test, and remarkably enhanced motor performances in acceleration rotarod motor test and catwalk quantitative gait analysis test after TBI. Moreover, DCXF treatment was able to reduce BBB permeability, brain edema, microglia and astrocyte activation, improve the proliferation of NSCs and decrease neurons loss in the brain with TBI.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study demonstrated that DCXF treatment could decrease BBB leakage and brain edema, reduce neuron loss, microglia and astrocyte activation, and increase NSCs proliferation, which may contribute to the cognitive and motor protection of DCXF in the TBI rats. It is the first time to provide potentially underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect of DCXF on TBI-induced brain damage and functional outcomes.",29425850,2018,Neuroprotective effect of Da Chuanxiong Formula against cognitive and motor deficits in a rat controlled cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury.
411,"Implanted vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for obesity was recently approved by the FDA. However, its efficacy and mechanisms of action remain unclear. Herein, we synthesize clinical and preclinical effects of VNS on feeding behavior and energy balance and discuss engineering considerations for understanding and improving the therapy. Clinical cervical VNS (≤30 Hz) to treat epilepsy or depression has produced mixed effects on weight loss as a side effect, albeit in uncontrolled, retrospective studies. Conversely, preclinical studies (cervical and subdiaphragmatic VNS) mostly report decreased food intake and either decreased weight gain or weight loss. More recent clinical studies report weight loss in response to kilohertz frequency VNS applied to the subdiaphragmatic vagi, albeit with a large placebo effect. Rather than eliciting neural activity, this therapy putatively blocks conduction in the vagus nerves. Overall, stimulation parameters lack systematic exploration, optimization, and justification based on target nerve fibers and therapeutic outcomes. The vagus nerve transduces, transmits, and integrates important neural (efferent and afferent), humoral, energetic, and inflammatory information between the gut and brain. Thus, improved understanding of the biophysics, electrophysiology, and (patho)physiology has the potential to advance VNS as an effective therapy for a wide range of diseases.",29425906,2018,Effects of vagal neuromodulation on feeding behavior.
412,"Disrupted sociability and consequent social withdrawal are (early) symptoms of a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, depressive disorders and Alzheimer's disease. The paucity of objective measures to translationally assess social withdrawal characteristics has been an important limitation to study this behavioral phenotype, both in human and rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate sociability and social withdrawal in rodents using an ethologically valid behavioral paradigm, the Visible Burrow System (VBS). The VBS mimics a natural environment, with male and female rodents housed together in an enclosure where a large open arena is connected to a continuously dark burrow system that includes 4 nest boxes. In this study, mixed-sex colonies of C57BL/6J and of BTBR mice have been investigated (n = 8 mice per colony). Results showed marked differences between the two strains, in terms of sociability as well as social withdrawal behaviors. In particular, BTBR mice performed less social behaviors and have a preference for non-social behaviors compared to C57BL/6J mice. Neurobiologically, the decreased sociability of BTBR was accompanied by reduced GABA and increased glutamate concentrations in brain prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala regions. In conclusion, our study validated the use of the VBS as an ethologically relevant behavioral paradigm in group-housed mice to investigate individual sociability and social withdrawal features and their underlying neurobiology. This paradigm may provide new insights to develop new therapeutic treatments for behavioral dysfunctions that may be relevant across neuropsychiatric diseases.",29425919,2018,The Visible Burrow System: A behavioral paradigm to assess sociability and social withdrawal in BTBR and C57BL/6J mice strains.
413,"High consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is a risk factor for weight gain and metabolic disease. Whether this risk is reduced by switching to 'diet' beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) is controversial. Two experiments modeled whether a switch from SSB to LCS beverages produced positive outcomes on behavioral and metabolic measures. Both experiments consisted of a Stage 1, in which adult female rats received unrestricted access to 10% sucrose solution in addition to chow and water for 4 (Experiment 1) or 8 weeks (Experiment 2). In Stage 2 rats were switched to either saccharin (Suc-Sacch) or water (Suc-Water) or remained on 10% sucrose (Suc-Suc) for a further 4 (Experiment 1) or 7 weeks (Experiment 2). Experiment 2 contained a fourth group that was maintained on water throughout (Water-Water). In both experiments energy intake and weight gain in Stage 2 was reduced for Suc-Sacch and Suc-Water groups relative to the Suc-Suc groups and at cull the Suc-Suc groups showed poorer insulin sensitivity and greater g/kg fat than Suc-Water and Suc-Sacch groups. In Experiment 2 short-term place recognition memory was impaired at the end of Stage 1 but recovered to a similar extent in the Suc-Water and Suc-Sacch groups; when the latter groups were compared with the Water-Water group, recovery was found to be essentially complete. A higher saccharin concentration in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 increased absolute amounts of saccharin ingested but intake solution volumes remained low. These results show that switching from sucrose to either water or saccharin produces equivalent improvements on both metabolic and cognitive measures.",29425973,2018,Metabolic and cognitive improvement from switching to saccharin or water following chronic consumption by female rats of 10% sucrose solution.
414,"Despite increased methamphetamine use worldwide, pharmacotherapies are not available to treat methamphetamine use disorder. The vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) is an important pharmacological target for discovery of treatments for methamphetamine use disorder. VMAT2 inhibition by the natural product, lobeline, reduced methamphetamine-evoked dopamine release, methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and methamphetamine self-administration in rats. Compared to lobeline, lobelane exhibited improved affinity and selectivity for VMAT2 over nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Lobelane inhibited neurochemical and behavioral effects of methamphetamine, but tolerance developed to its behavioral efficacy in reducing methamphetamine self-administration, preventing further development. The lobelane analog, R-N-(1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-2,6-cis-di-(4-methoxyphenethyl)piperidine hydrochloride (GZ-793A), potently and selectively inhibited VMAT2 function and reduced neurochemical and behavioral effects of methamphetamine. However, GZ-793A exhibited potential to induce ventricular arrhythmias interacting with human-ether-a-go-go (hERG) channels. Herein, a new lead, R-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(1-phenylpropan-2-yl)propan-1-amine (GZ-11610), from the novel scaffold (N-alkyl(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)amine) was evaluated as a VMAT2 inhibitor and potential therapeutic for methamphetamine use disorder. GZ-11610 was 290-fold selective for VMAT2 over dopamine transporters, suggesting that it may lack abuse liability. GZ-11610 was 640- to 3500-fold selective for VMAT2 over serotonin transporters and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. GZ-11610 exhibited > 1000-fold selectivity for VMAT2 over hERG, representing a robust improvement relative to our previous VMAT2 inhibitors. GZ-11610 (3-30 mg/kg, s.c. or 56-300 mg/kg, oral) reduced methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity in methamphetamine-sensitized rats. Thus, GZ-11610 is a potent and selective inhibitor of VMAT2, may have low abuse liability and low cardiotoxicity, and after oral administration is effective and specific in inhibiting the locomotor stimulant effects of methamphetamine, suggesting further investigation as a potential therapeutic for methamphetamine use disorder.",29427069,2018,New Scaffold for Lead Compounds to Treat Methamphetamine Use Disorders.
415,"Calcineurin is required for long-term depression and activity-dependent spine shrinkage, and calcineurin mutations have been identified in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, mice with conditional knockout of calcineurin B (CNB-KO) exhibit behavioral abnormalities suggestive of schizophrenia. Changes in the dendritic spines of these mice, however, have not been investigated. We therefore examined the dendritic spines of CNB-KO mice, and observed a significant reduction in small spines and an increase in large spines in the prefrontal and visual cortices. The effect of CNB-KO on the spine sizes was relatively moderate, possibly due to the presence of spontaneous fluctuations (dynamics) in the dendritic spines themselves. Thus, CNB-KO mice showed a spine phenotype similar to those recently reported in patients with schizophrenia.",29427598,2018,Calcineurin knockout mice show a selective loss of small spines.
416,"Thiamine/vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in humans. This may due in part to vascular damage, neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration in the diencephalon, which is seen in animal models of pyrithiamine-enhanced thiamine deficiency. However, the time course of the progression of these changes in the animal models has been poorly characterized. Therefore, in this study, the progression of: 1) activated microglial association with vasculature; 2) neurodegeneration; and 3) any vascular leakage in the forebrain during the progress of thiamine deficiency were determined. A thiamine deficient diet along with 0.25 mg/kg/d of pyrithiamine was used as the mouse model. Vasculature was identified with Cd31 and microglia with Cd11b and Iba1 immunoreactivity. Neurodegeneration was determined by FJc labeling. The first sign of activated microglia within the thalamic nuclei were detected after 8 d of thiamine deficiency, and by 9 d activated microglia associated primarily with vasculature were clearly present but only in thalamus. At the 8 d time point neurodegeneration was not present in thalamus. However at 9 d, the first signs of neurodegeneration (FJc + neurons) were seen in most animals. Over 80% of the microglia were activated at 10 d but almost exclusively in the thalamus and the number of degenerating neurons was less than 10% of the activated microglia. At 10 d, there were sporadic minor changes in IgG presence in thalamus indicating minor vascular leakage. Dizocilpine (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) or phenobarbital (10-20 mg/kg) was administered to groups of mice from day 8 through day 10 to block neurodegeneration but neither did. In summary, activated microglia start to surround vasculature 1-2 d prior to the start of neurodegeneration. This response may be a means of controlling or repairing vascular damage and leakage. Glutamate excitotoxicity and vascular leakage likely only play a minor role in the early neurodegeneration resulting from thiamine deficiency. However, failure of dysfunctional vasculature endothelium to supply sufficient nutrients to neurons could be contributing to the neurodegeneration.",29427613,2018,Microglial activation and vascular responses that are associated with early thalamic neurodegeneration resulting from thiamine deficiency.
417,"Therapy or prophylaxis of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections with the nucleoside analog aciclovir (ACV) can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HSV-2 strains, particularly in immunocompromised patients. In this context, multiple amino acid (aa) changes can accumulate in the ACV-converting viral thymidine kinase (TK) which hampers sequence-based diagnostics significantly. In this study, the so far unknown or still doubted relevance of several individual aa changes for drug resistance in HSV-2 was clarified. For this purpose, ten recombinant fluorescent HSV-2 strains differing in the respective aa within their TK were constructed using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) pHSV2(MS)Lox. Similar TK expression levels and similar replication behavior patterns were demonstrated for the mutants as compared to the unmodified BAC-derived HSV-2 strain. Subsequently, the resulting strains were tested for their susceptibility to ACV as well as penciclovir (PCV) in parallel to a modified cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay and by determining the relative fluorescence intensity (quantified using units, RFU) as a measure for the viral replication capacity. While aa changes Y53N and R221H conferred ACV resistance with cross-resistance to PCV, the aa changes G25A, G39E, T131M, Y133F, G150D, A157T, R248W, and L342W maintained a susceptible phenotype against both antivirals. The CPE inhibition assay and the measurement of relative fluorescence intensity yielded comparable results for the phenotypic testing of recombinant viruses. The latter test showed some technical advantages. In conclusion, the significance of single aa changes in HSV-2 TK on ACV/PCV resistance was clarified by the construction and phenotypic testing of recombinant viral strains. This was facilitated by the fluorescence based method.",29427675,2018,Relevance of non-synonymous thymidine kinase mutations for antiviral resistance of recombinant herpes simplex virus type 2 strains.
418,"Obesity is a public health problem that disproportionately affects low-income populations. Moreover, participation in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been associated with obesity among low-income women. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors on diet quality and body mass index (BMI) of low-income women participating in SNAP. This study also aimed to examine the role of these factors in mediating the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality, and BMI. A total of 152 women receiving SNAP benefits were recruited from low-income neighborhood centers and housing communities, and administered a demographics questionnaire, the United States adult food security scale, food frequency questionnaire, and multi-dimensional home environment scale (MHES). They also were measured for height and weight to calculate BMI. The Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index 2015 was used to measure diet quality. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the MHES subscales that were significant predictors of diet quality and BMI. The Preacher and Hayes mediation model was used to evaluate the mediation of the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality, and BMI by the MHES. Emotional eating resistance and favorable social eating behaviors were positively associated with diet quality; whereas emotional eating resistance, lower availability of unhealthy food at home, neighborhood safety and favorable social eating behaviors were inversely associated with BMI in women participating in SNAP. The MHES significantly mediated the relationship between food insecurity and BMI. These results emphasize the importance of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors in mediating the relationship between food insecurity and BMI in low-income women.",29427689,2018,"Food insecurity, diet quality and body mass index of women participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: The role of intrapersonal, home environment, community and social factors."
419,"Beyond mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) have been becoming an even more attractive alternative to the traditional organic or inorganic nanomaterials in biomedical applications, especially for drug delivery, due to its high surface area, stable physicochemical properties, low toxicity, high biocompatibility, and particularly the devisable features decided by the incorporated organic fragments. However, it is still challenging to fabricate uniform ultrasmall MONs with tunable composition, morphology and fine biodegradability. Herein, we report, on the large-scale fabrication of monodispersed and molecularly organic-inorganic hybrid MONs with framework-incorporated physiologically active thioether bonds, controllable nanostructure, composition and morphology, which provides the material foundation for exploring the versatile biomedical applications of organosilica nanosystems. The hybrid MONs of less than 50 nm in particle size exhibit the unique reduction-responsive biodegradation behavior, and the biodegradation rate is significantly higher than that of traditional mesoporous silica nanoparticles with pure inorganic SiOSi framework. The reductive microenvironment-triggered biodegradation of MONs induces the concurrent reduction-responsive anticancer drug releasing from MONs, enabling tumor-specific drug delivery. Importantly, these biocompatible and biodegradable MONs exhibit significantly improved drug-delivery efficiency and enhanced tumor-suppressing effect for combating cancer. Based on the facile and large-scale fabrication of MONs with controllable key structure/composition/morphology parameters, unique tumor microenvironment-responsive biodegradation behavior and high performance for drug delivery, the MONs therefore show more promising potentials for clinical translation as compared to traditional MSNs.",29427925,2018,Ultrasmall mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles: Morphology modulations and redox-responsive biodegradability for tumor-specific drug delivery.
420,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate and correlate, before and after the therapeutic intervention, the behavioral problem scores evaluated by the CBCL/6-18 questionnaire and the quality of life indexes evaluated by the PedsQL™ 4.0 in patients with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis.


METHOD
After the initial evaluation and completion of the CBCL/6-18 questionnaire, a multidisciplinary evaluation and completion of the PedsQL™ 4.0 questionnaire was performed. Of the initially evaluated 140 children and adolescents aged 6-16 years, 58 were excluded due to non-monosymptomatic enuresis or associated comorbidities. Of the initially included 82 patients, who were randomized to three treatment groups, 59 completed the CBCL/6-18 and PedsQL™ 4.0 questionnaires at the end of the treatment and were included in this study. The α error was set at 5% for ruling out the null hypothesis.


RESULTS
Of the total of 59 participants, 45.8% responded with total success, 23.7% were partially successful, 23.7% did not reach the improvement criteria, and 6.8% gave up the treatment. There was a significant increase in quality of life indexes and a reduction of post-intervention behavioral problem scores, in the three proposed modalities, in patients who had a total or partial response to treatment. There was no correlation between higher scores of pre-treatment behavior problems and therapeutic failure.


CONCLUSIONS
Only the participants who successfully responded to interventions showed improvement in quality of life and behavioral problems, which indicates that enuresis is a primary problem that has a negative impact on these parameters. The authors suggest that it is possible to achieve success in the treatment of monosymptomatic enuresis, even in patients with high pre-intervention behavioral problem scores.",29428322,2018,Study of the profile of behavioral problems and quality of life indexes in a pediatric cohort of monosymptomatic enuresis.
421,"AIMS
We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time.


METHODS
The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age.


RESULTS
Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.


CONCLUSIONS
Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.",29428324,2018,"Pre- and postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure and child behavior problems: Bidirectional associations, joint effects, and sex differences."
422,"In light of the current worldwide addiction epidemic, the need for successful therapies is more urgent than ever. Although we made substantial progress in our basic understanding of addiction, reliable therapies are lacking. Since 40-60% of patients treated for substance use disorder return to active substance use within a year following treatment discharge, alleviating the vulnerability to relapse is regarded as the most promising avenue for addiction therapy. Preclinical addiction research often focuses on maladaptive synaptic plasticity within the reward pathway. However, drug induced neuroadaptations do not only lead to a strengthening of distinct drug associated cues and drug conditioned behaviors, but also seem to increase plasticity thresholds for environmental stimuli that are not associated with the drug. This form of higher order plasticity, or synaptic metaplasticity, is not expressed as a change in the efficacy of synaptic transmission but as a change in the direction or degree of plasticity induced by a distinct stimulation pattern. Experimental addiction research has demonstrated metaplasticity after exposure to multiple classes of addictive drugs. In this review we will focus on the concept of synaptic metaplasticity in the context of preclinical addiction research. We will take a closer look at the tetrapartite glutamatergic synapse and outline forms of metaplasticity that have been described at the addicted synapse. Finally we will discuss the different potential avenues for pharmacotherapies that target glutamatergic synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity. Here we will argue that aberrant metaplasticity renders the reward seeking circuitry more rigid and hence less able to adapt to changing environmental contingencies. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this metaplasticity is crucial for the development of new strategies for addiction therapy. The correction of drug-induced metaplasticity could be used to support behavioral and pharmacotherapies for the treatment of addiction.",29428364,2018,Metaplasticity at the addicted tetrapartite synapse: A common denominator of drug induced adaptations and potential treatment target for addiction.

A new but simple method was employed, in which a dye solution was added to ssDNA-SWCNTs that had been prepared beforehand in the conventional way. Resulting conjugates of dyes, DNA, and SWCNTs were precisely evaluated by ultraviolet to near-infrared fluorescence/absorbance spectrometry and atomic force microscopy. In particular, simultaneous measurements of fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy enabled us to find differences in the behaviors of the dyes on SWCNT surfaces. As a result, the fluorescence/absorbance spectra of dyes showed significant changes upon adsorption on SWCNTs. The fluorescence/absorbance peaks of Uranine, R800, and ICG were quenched by 41.3/2.8%, 72.3/48.9%, and 88.3/45.0%, respectively, in the presence of 11.5 μg/mL SWCNTs. We concluded firstly that by pre-wrapping SWCNTs with ssDNA, stable hybrids with these components were obtained even if the dyes used were relatively hydrophobic and secondly that Uranine retained light absorption on the surface of SWCNT while R800 and ICG did not.",29428378,2018,A convenient method of attaching fluorescent dyes on single-walled carbon nanotubes pre-wrapped with DNA molecules.
424,"Most everyday manual tasks, like grabbing a cup of coffee to drink, are comprised of a sequence of action phases. Efficient phase transitions, or linking, are achieved using a predictive control policy where motor commands for the next phase are specified and released in anticipation of sensory confirmation of goal completion of the current phase. If there is a discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory feedback about goal completion, corrective actions are employed to complete the current action phase before proceeding to the next. However, we lack understanding about brain activations supporting such predictive linking and corrective actions in manual tasks. In this study, during 3-T MRI-scanning, sixteen participants (5 males, 11 females; mean age 27.3 years, range 23-37) performed a sequential manual task, with or without the possibility for predictive linking. We found that predictive linking of action phases was associated with increased activation in a network that included right-sided fronto-parietal areas related to visuospatial attention, eye movements and motor planning, left-sided parietal areas related to implicit timing and shifts of motor attention, occipital regions bilaterally reflecting visual processing related to the attended next target, and finally, the anterior midcingulate cortex involved in continuous performance monitoring.

425,"Neurologically healthy young adults display a behavioral bias, called pseudoneglect, which favors the processing of stimuli appearing in the left visual field. Pseudoneglect arises from the right hemisphere dominance for visuospatial attention. Previous studies investigating the effects of normal aging on pseudoneglect in line bisection and greyscale tasks have produced divergent results. In addition, scarce systematic investigations of visual biases in dementia have been reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the leftward bias appearing during an enumeration task in young adults would be preserved in normal aging and at different stages of severity of Alzheimer's disease. In Experiment 1, young and older healthy adults showed a comparable pseudoneglect, performing better when targets appeared in the left visual field. In Experiment 2, the leftward bias was maintained in amnesic mild cognitive impairment patients (aMCI), but it vanished in mild Alzheimer's disease patients (AD). The maintenance of pseudoneglect in normal aging and in aMCI patients is consistent with compensatory phenomena involving the right fronto-parietal network, which allow maintaining the right hemisphere dominance. Conversely, the lack of pseudoneglect in the sample of AD patients likely results from a loss of the right hemisphere dominance, caused by the selective degeneration of the right fronto-parietal network. These results highlight the need of further systematic investigations of visuospatial biases along the continuum of normal and pathological aging, both for a better understanding of the changes characterizing cognitive aging and for improvements in the evaluation of neglect in Alzheimer's disease.",29428770,2018,Pseudoneglect is maintained in aging but not in mild Alzheimer's disease: new insights from an enumeration task.
426,"Individuals with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) experience episodic memory deficits that may be progressive in nature. These memory decrements have been shown to increase with the extent of hippocampal damage, a hallmark feature of TLE. Pattern separation, a neural computational mechanism thought to play a role in episodic memory formation, has been shown to be negatively affected by aging and in individuals with known hippocampal dysfunction. Despite the link between poor pattern separation performance and episodic memory deficits, behavioral pattern separation has not been examined in patients with TLE. We examined pattern separation performance in a group of 22 patients with medically-refractory TLE and 20 healthy adults, using a task hypothesized to measure spatial pattern separation with graded levels of spatial interference. We found that individuals with TLE showed less efficient spatial pattern separation performance relative to healthy adults. Poorer spatial pattern separation performance in TLE was associated with poorer visuospatial memory, but only under high interference conditions. In addition, left hippocampal atrophy was associated with poor performance in the high interference condition in TLE. These data suggest that episodic memory impairments in patients with chronic, refractory TLE may be partially due to less efficient pattern separation, which likely reflects their underlying hippocampal dysfunction.",29428769,2018,Impaired spatial pattern separation performance in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with visuospatial memory deficits and hippocampal volume loss.
427,"Silicon- and oxygen-containing hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H:Si:O) coatings are amorphous thin-film materials composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H), doped with silicon and oxygen. Compared to a-C:H, a-C:H:Si:O exhibits much lower susceptibility to oxidative degradation and higher thermal stability, making a-C:H:Si:O attractive for many applications. However, the physical mechanisms for this improved behavior are not understood. Here, the thermally induced structural evolution of a-C:H:Si:O was investigated in situ by X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy, as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The spectroscopy results indicate that upon high vacuum annealing, two thermally activated processes with a Gaussian distribution of activation energies with mean value E and standard deviation σ take place in a-C:H:Si:O: (a) ordering and clustering of sp2 carbon (E ± σ = 0.22 ± 0.08 eV) and (b) conversion of sp3- to sp2-bonded carbon (E ± σ = 3.0 ± 1.1 eV). The experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the outcomes of MD simulations performed using a ReaxFF potential. The MD simulations also indicate that the higher thermal stability of a-C:H:Si:O compared to a-C:H (with similar fraction of sp2-bonded carbon and hydrogen content) derives from the significantly lower fraction of strained carbon-carbon sp3 bonds in a-C:H:Si:O compared to a-C:H, which are more likely to break at elevated temperatures.",29432688,2018,Thermally Induced Structural Evolution of Silicon- and Oxygen-Containing Hydrogenated Amorphous Carbon: A Combined Spectroscopic and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Investigation.

We tested the potential effect of long non-coding RNA 00312 (""Lnc00312"") on human HCC cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. Forced-expression of Lnc00312 by a lentiviral vector induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HepG2 cells and primary human HCC cells. Lnc00312 downregulated cyclin B1 and induced G2-M cell cycle arrest in HCC cells. Restoring cyclin B1 expression by a cyclin B1 cDNA construct inhibited Lnc00312-induced cytotoxicity against HCC cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Lnc00312 increased cyclin B1 expression and promoted HepG2 cell proliferation. In vivo, the growth of HepG2 xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice was largely inhibited after expression of Lnc00312. Significantly, Lnc00312 is downregulated in human HCC tissues, which is negatively correlated with the tumor grade. Overall, Lnc00312 inhibits human HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

429,"The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by elevated interleukin (IL) levels has been reported to regulate tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the clinical implication of p-STAT3 expression in colon cancer is still controversial. In this study, we evaluated the effect of STAT3 inactivation on biologic behavior of primary (Caco-2) and metastatic colon cancer cells (LoVo and SNU407) and the relation of p-STAT3 expression with the invasion of colon tumor. In vitro study, the STAT3 inhibition by siRNA and stattic treatment significantly reduced colony formation and cell migration and decreased CD133 and survivin the expression compared with a control in all three cell lines. Furthermore, primary cancer cells exhibited a marked decrease in CD133 expression and increased apoptosis compared to metastatic cells after stattic treatment. The immunohistochemical assay using clinical samples of colonic tumors with various invasion depth showed that p-STAT3 expression was inversely associated with tumor invasion (p = 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.328, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.170-0.632). In conclusion, p-STAT3 may participate in the progression of the early stage of colon cancer through the up-regulation of CD133, which in turn induces survivin expression. However, the regulatory mechanism of these molecules in tumor progression in vivo is need to be more verified.",29432737,2018,Activated STAT3 may participate in tumor progression through increasing CD133/survivin expression in early stage of colon cancer.
430,"Itch is an unpleasant sensation that evokes behavioral responses such as scratching the skin. Interestingly, it is conceived that the perception of itch sensation is influenced by age. Indeed, accumulating evidence supports the idea that even children or younger adults show distinctive itch sensation depending on age. This evidence implies the presence of a mechanism that regulates the perception of itch sensation in an age-dependent fashion. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate a putative mechanism for the age-dependent perception of itch sensation by comparing histamine-induced scratching behaviors in 45-day old (D45) and 75-day old male ""young adult"" mice. The results indicated that, following histamine administration, the D75 mice spent a longer time scratching than D45 mice. However, the intensity of the calcium influx induced by histamine in primary culture of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons was not different between D45 and D75 mice. Moreover, no apparent difference was observed in mRNA levels of a characteristic His-related receptor and ion channel. In contrast, the mRNA levels of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) were increased approximately by two-fold in D75 DRG compared with D45 DRG. Additionally, D75-derived DRG neurons exhibited enhanced intracellular calcium increase by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 agonist) than those of D45 mice. Furthermore, intensities of calcium influx induced by histamine were significantly potentiated when co-treated with LPS in D75 DRG neurons, but not in those of D45 mice. Thus, it appears that D75 mice showed enhanced histamine-induced scratching behaviors not by increased expression levels of histamine-related genes, but probably due to augmented TLR4 expression in DRG neurons. Consequently, the current study found that different perception levels of histamine-induced itch sensation are present in different age groups of young adult mice.",29432788,2018,Different perception levels of histamine-induced itch sensation in young adult mice.
431,"This paper describes a new pH-responsive peptide tag that adds a protein reversible precipitation and redissolution character. This peptide tag is a part of a cell surface protein B (CspB) derived from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Proinsulin that genetically fused with a peptide of N-terminal 6, 17, 50, or 250 amino acid residues of CspB showed that the reversible precipitation and redissolution depended on the pH. The transition occurred within a physiological and narrow pH range. A CspB50 tag comprising 50 amino acid residues of N-terminal CspB was further evaluated as a representative using other pharmaceutical proteins. Below pH 6.8, almost all CspB50-Teriparatide fusion formed an aggregated state. Subsequent addition of alkali turned the cloudy protein solution transparent above pH 7.3, in which almost all the CspB50-Teriparatide fusion redissolved. The CspB50-Bivalirudin fusion showed a similar behavior with slightly different pH range. This tag is offering a new protein purification method based on liquid-solid separation which does not require an affinity ligand.

432,"The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is increasing despite insufficient information concerning their long-term effects, including the effects of maternal e-cigarette use on pre- and postnatal development. Our previous study demonstrated that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol (a principal component of e-cigarette liquid) affected early development of zebrafish, causing reduced growth, deformities, and hyperactive swimming behavior in larvae. The current study extends assessment of the developmental toxicity of 1,2-propanediol by examining additional long-term behavioral effects. We demonstrate that embryonic/larval exposure of zebrafish to 1,2-propanediol (0.625% or 1.25%) not only affected behavioral parameters in the larvae, but also caused persisting behavioral effects in adults after early developmental exposure. Additional parameters, including neural and vascular development in larvae, stress response in adults, and concentration of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in adult brain were examined, in order to explain the behavioral differences. These additional assessments did not find 1,2-propanediol exposure to significantly affect Tg(Neurog1:GFP) or the transcript abundance of neural genes (Neurog1, Ascl1a, Elavl3, and Lef1). Vascular development was not found to be affected by 1,2-propanediol exposure, as inferred from experiments with Tg(Flk1:eGFP) zebrafish; however, transcript abundance of vascular genes (Flk1, Vegf, Tie-2, and Angpt1) was decreased. No statistically significant changes were noted for plasma cortisol or brain neurotransmitters in adult fish. Lastly, analysis of gene transcripts involved with 1,2-propanediol metabolism (Adh5, Aldh2.1, and Ldha) showed an increase in Adh5 transcript. This is the first study to demonstrate that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol has long-term neurobehavioral consequences in adult zebrafish, showing that e-cigarettes contain substances potentially harmful to neurodevelopment.",29432853,2018,"Neurobehavioral effects of 1,2-propanediol in zebrafish (Danio rerio)."
433,"Although regular physical activity is known to benefit health of aging populations, there are still many factors, which regulate exercise-induced adaptive changes. Among many vitamin D and myokines are under consideration. We, therefore, evaluated the influence of a single session of and regular Nordic Walking (NW) training combined with vitamin D supplementation on cognitive functions and muscle strength and some elements of the amino-acid profile. Thirty-five healthy elderly women (68 ± 5 years old) from health promotion programmes took part in the study. At baseline they were divided into two groups: women, who participated in NW training for the first time (Beginners Group: BG) and women, who continued regular NW training longer than four years (Advance Group: AG). All women had a similar concentration of vitamin D (above 20 ng·ml-1) at baseline. The 12 weeks of NW training was supported by supplementation of vitamin D3 (4000 IU/day). Muscle strength, serum concentrations of myokines (irisin and IL-6), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammation marker, glucose, branched amino acids and tryptophan were all assessed at baseline, 1 h after the first single training session and adequately at the end of the training programme. In addition, iron and ferritin were measured. The concentration of vitamin D3 as well as psychological (Quality-of-Life Assessment, The Beck Depression Inventory-2) and cognitive evaluations (D2 test of attention, Trial Making Test A&B) were also performed before and after the 12-week training programme. Data were interpreted using magnitude-based inferences. According to data obtained in this study, regular NW training resulted in improvement of cognitive functions in aged women. These positive changes were accompanied by an increase of irisin and BDNF concentration (adjusted effect moderate and likely). Our data also revealed that observed reductions of glucose and tryptophan concentrations might have positively contributed to the amelioration of cognitive functions. Still, obtained results indicated that it was not the level vitamin D that modulated exercise-induced changes, but rather the long-lasting experience and being more advanced in training.",29432893,2018,Improvement of cognitive functions in response to a regular Nordic walking training in elderly women - A change dependent on the training experience.
434,"BACKGROUND
Species recognition, i.e., the ability to distinguish conspecifics from heterospecifics, plays an essential role in reproduction. The role of facial cues for species recognition has been investigated in several non-human primate species except for lemurs. We therefore investigated the role of facial cues for species recognition in wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) at Kirindy Forest. We presented adult red-fronted lemurs pictures of male faces from five species including red-fronted lemurs, three closely related species, white-fronted lemurs (E. albifrons), brown lemurs (E. fulvus), rufous brown lemurs (E. rufus), and genetically more distant red-bellied lemurs (E. rubriventer), occurring in allopatry with the study population. We predicted that red-fronted lemurs respond stronger to conspecific than to heterospecific pictures and that females show stronger responses than males. In addition, if genetic drift has played a role in the evolution of facial color patterns in the members of this genus, we predicted that responses of red-fronted lemurs correlate negatively with the genetic distance to the different species stimuli.


RESULTS
Red-fronted lemurs looked significantly longer at pictures of their own species than at those of heterospecifics. Females spent less time looking at pictures of white-fronted, brown and red-bellied lemurs than males did, but not to pictures of red-bellied lemurs and a control stimulus. Individuals also exhibited sniffing behavior while looking at visual stimuli, and the time spent sniffing was significantly longer for pictures of conspecifics compared to those of heterospecifics. Moreover, the time spent looking and sniffing towards the pictures correlated negatively with the genetic distance between their own species and the species presented as stimulus.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that red-fronted lemurs have the ability for species recognition using visual facial cues, which may allow them to avoid costly interbreeding. If so, sexual selection might have influenced the evolution of facial patterns in eulemurs. Since responses also correlated with genetic distance, our findings suggest a potential role of genetic drift as well as sexual selection in influencing the evolution of facial variation in eulemurs. Because study subjects looked and sniffed towards the presented pictures, red-fronted lemurs might have the ability for multi-modal species recognition.",29433448,2018,The role of facial pattern variation for species recognition in red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons).
435,"BACKGROUND
Tinnitus service provision in the United Kingdom has been investigated from the healthcare provider's perspective demonstrating considerable regional variation particularly regarding availability of psychological treatments. An audiological-based tinnitus service, however, was reportedly available for all tinnitus patients in the UK. The aim of the current study was to define and evaluate nationwide tinnitus healthcare services from the patients' viewpoint.


METHODS
Secondary analyses were performed on data from a 33-item questionnaire provided by the British Tinnitus Association. The questionnaire had been distributed via email and social media.


RESULTS
Responses from 937 participants who had or had previously experienced tinnitus were analysed. All but one person had at some time consulted their GP. About one in five received medication in primary care. The majority were referred to secondary care, generally an ENT surgeon or audiovestibular physician; some were referred directly to audiological services. In secondary care the majority underwent audiometric testing and over half underwent MRI scanning. Drugs were prescribed less frequently in secondary care. About one third of patients were referred onwards from diagnostic services in secondary care to receive therapeutic interventions for tinnitus. Therapy was generally delivered by an audiologist or hearing therapist. Just under two fifths of people discharged from secondary care returned to their GP, with most returning within one year. Over a third of this group were re-referred to secondary care. Few patients saw a psychologist (2.6%) though some psychological treatments were delivered by appropriately trained audiologists. Negative counselling from healthcare professionals in both primary and secondary care settings was reported.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the UK has developed a national service for patients with tinnitus many people find it difficult to access, being blocked at the primary care level or after secondary care diagnostic services. Many of those discharged from secondary care return to their GP within a short space of time and are re-referred to secondary care creating an unsatisfactory and expensive revolving-door pattern of healthcare. Despite psychological treatment modalities having the best evidence base for successful tinnitus management, only a minority of tinnitus patients ever get to meet a psychologist.",29433479,2018,Tinnitus services in the United Kingdom: a survey of patient experiences.

In the present study, the effect of postnatal stressor on the spontaneous behavior of adult male rats was evaluated. A method of positive habituation based on a detailed analysis of behavioral patterns and attention of animals to a stimulus object was used. Twenty-four dams and twenty-four of their male progeny were used. Pups were divided into three groups (n = 8): controls (C); maternal social stressor (S); maternal social and physical stressors (SW). Animals (postnatal day 70-80) were individually placed in the open field arena in two habituation sessions with a 24-h delay between them (Test day 1 and Test day 2). Before the start of third session (Test day 3) a solid object was fixed in the center of the arena. Each test lasted 10 min. Our results showed the habituation effect in both stressed-groups. Although there were no significant differences in the number of investigations of the novel object among all tested groups, stress-exposed rats spent less time investigating the object. In conclusion, our findings indicate that long-term neonatal stress may impair an animal's ability to sustain attention to stimuli.",29438728,2018,Long-term early life adverse experience impairs responsiveness to exteroceptive stimuli in adult rats.
438,"Metaplasticity is the dynamic regulation of the ability to induce activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and is governed by the prior history of the synapses. Previous reports by others and us have shown that behavioral stress induces a form of emotional metaplasticity that affects the ability to induce LTP in the subiculum-medial prefrontal cortex pathway, which depends on NMDA receptors (NMDAr). However, studies addressing the effects of stress on LTP and metaplasticity have mainly focused on the adult animal. Here we compared the effects of exposure to stress on the induction of LTP in adult and juvenile animals and examined whether a low dose of NMDAr antagonist (MK801) that does not affect LTP per se would differentially affect stress-induced metaplasticity in adult and juvenile animals. Our findings show that exposure to the elevated platform differentially affects the induction of LTP in adult and juvenile animals. Specifically, whereas exposure to stress resulted in impaired LTP in adult animals, it resulted in enhanced LTP in juvenile animals. Similarly, while MK801 failed to inhibit the induction of LTP in both age groups, it resulted in inhibition of stress-induced enhanced LTP in juvenile animals, but did not affect stress-induced impaired LTP in adult animals. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that emotional metaplasticity is differently dependent on NMDAr in adult and juvenile animals that may stem from developmental differences in the NMDA receptor representation. These results further confirm that the mechanisms of plasticity following stress are distinctive in the two groups of age.",29438741,2018,Different mechanisms underlie stress-induced changes in plasticity and metaplasticity in the prefrontal cortex of juvenile and adult animals: Emotional-induced metaplasticity in the prefrontal cortex.
439,"Tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus play a role in inhibiting prolactin (PRL) secretion from the anterior pituitary. PRL is involved in a variety of behaviors, including feeding. Consequently, we hypothesized that fasting might reduce the activity of TIDA neurons, which might alter PRL secretion. However, direct examinations of TIDA neuron activity are difficult. Recently, transgenic mice were generated that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene. We first determined that GFP in the dorsomedial ARC was a reliable marker of TIDA neurons. Then, we performed electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry in GFP-labeled TIDA neurons to examine whether different feeding conditions could change their activity. Eight-week-old male mice were fed or fasted for 24 h. After sacrifice, we prepared acutely isolated brain slices for conducting whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. TIDA neurons were identified with fluorescence microscopy. The mean amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was significantly reduced in fasting mice compared to fed mice, but different feeding conditions did not affect the mean mEPSC intervals. This result suggested that fasting reduced the number of excitatory synaptic inputs to TIDA neurons. To determine whether a reduction in excitatory synaptic inputs would cause a reduction in TIDA neuron activity, we examined the effect of 24-h fasting on c-Fos expression in the ARC. We found that fasting significantly reduced the number of Fos-positive TIDA neurons. In addition, serum PRL levels were significantly increased. Taken together, the present findings suggested that short-term fasting attenuated TIDA neuron activity.",29438798,2018,Short-term fasting decreases excitatory synaptic inputs to ventromedial tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons and attenuates their activity in male mice.
440,"Temperature controlled ionic liquid aqueous two phase system (ILATPS) was used to improve the precision of pharmaceutical-AGP (human alpha (α1)-acid glycoprotein) binding measurements by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). The effect of different types of short-chain alkyl imidazolium ILs within the concentration range of 10.0-1000.0 μmol L-1 on a propranolol (PRO)-AGP model was firstly investigated by ILATPS/ACE system. Use of 100.0 μmol L-1 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMImCl) in 67.0 mmol L-1 potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing low concentrations of AGP (5.0-100.0 µmol L-1) gave the highest precision value (2.98 ± 0.14 × 105 L/mol) which is in concord with the reported one (3.00 × 105) under similar experimental conditions. The proposed BMImCl/phosphate solution was a unique temperature controlled system to preserve AGP activity during the pre-analysis and within ACE measurements under lab conditions for about 30 days. This period could be prolonged by converting the one-phase solution into biphasic solution at 4 °C storage temperature and again it could get rapidly back into one-phase by raising the temperature with gentle shaking. This behavior could be attributed to the electrostatic interaction and π-π interaction between BMIm cations and negatively charged AGP ions (pI = 2.7). Moreover, the compatibility of ILATPS with ACE has been the critical factor to avoid precipitation of salts formed by anion exchange in the running buffer. The current ILATPS/ACE system was further used to rapidly and precisely estimate the binding constants of anticancer drugs methotrexate (MTX) and vinblastine (VBL) with human AGP. The obtained binding values have been in good agreements with their findings by high performance affinity chromatography (HPAC). This ILATP/ACE system could similarly be applied to improve the precision of other proteins binding measurements with consuming a small amount of protein and with shortening ACE analysis time.",29438832,2018,Temperature controlled ionic liquid aqueous two phase system combined with affinity capillary electrophoresis for rapid and precise pharmaceutical-protein binding measurements.

Quantum chemistry methods, combined with a dielectric continuum description of the solvent, has received attention as a first principle approach. In this work, the performance of the continuum solvation model based on density (SMD) for prediction of γ∞ in binary liquid mixtures, using 46 values of γ∞, was evaluated. We found the mean uncertainty of RTln γ∞ to be 0.92 kcal mol-1. Based on the calculated γ∞ and the two parameters of the Redlich-Kister expansion, we calculated the liquid-liquid phase equilibria. Based on 26 values of solubility, an uncertainty of 0.66 was found in the logarithm of molar fraction of the smallest component in each phase.

442,"The brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) controling behaviors like arousal, sleep, breathing, pain or opioid withdrawal is an established model for spontaneous action potential synchronization. Such synchronous 'spiking' might produce an extracellular field potential (FP) which is a crucial tool for neural network analyses. We found using ≥10 μm tip diameter suction electrodes in newborn rat brainstem slices that the LC generates at ∼1 Hz a robust rhythmic FP (rFP). During distinct rFP phases, LC neurons discharge with a jitter of ±33 ms single spikes that summate to a ∼200 ms-lasting population burst. The rFP is abolished by blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels with tetrodotoxin (TTX, 50 nM) or gap junctions with mefloquine (100 μM) and activating μ-opioid receptors with [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO, 1 μM). Raising superfusate K+ from 3 to 7 mM either increases rFP rate or transforms its pattern to slower and longer multipeak bursts similar to those during early recovery from DAMGO. The results show that electrical coupling of neonatal LC neurons does not synchronize their spiking as previously proposed. They also indicate that both increased excitability (by elevated K+) and recovery from inhibition (by opioids) can enhance spike desynchronization to transform the population burst pattern. Both observations show that this gap junction-coupled neural network has a more complex connectivity than currently assumed. These new findings along with the inhibitory drug effects that are in line with previous reports based on single neuron recording point out that field potential analysis is pivotal to further the understanding of this brain circuit.",29447951,2018,Suction electrode recording in locus coeruleus of newborn rat brain slices reveals network bursting comprising summated non-synchronous spiking.
443,"Insulin, a pancreatic hormone, can access the central nervous system, activate insulin receptors distributed in selective brain regions and affect various cellular functions such as neurotransmission. We have previously shown that physiologically relevant concentration of insulin potentiates the GABAA receptor-mediated tonic inhibition and reduces excitability of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) comprises heterogeneous neuronal populations that can respond to hormonal stimulus. Using quantitative PCR and immunofluorescent labeling, we report that the mRNA and protein of the insulin receptor are abundantly expressed in the rat CeA. The insulin receptor mRNA is also detected in the CeA from post-mortem human brain samples. Furthermore, our whole-cell patch-clamp recordings show that the application of insulin (5 and 50 nM) selectively enhances the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in rat CeA neurons. Our findings reveal that GABAergic synaptic transmission is a target in the CeA for insulin receptor signaling that may underlie insulin modulation of emotion- and feeding-related behaviors.",29447952,2018,Insulin enhances GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory currents in rat central amygdala neurons.

As part of the larger Society of Pediatric Psychology Workforce Survey and in collaboration with the American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Studies, this study aimed to: (1) describe the career domains which pediatric psychologists perceive to be important and their satisfaction in each domain, and (2) compare satisfaction of pediatric psychologists across work settings, number of positions, appointment duration, professional roles, career stage, academic rank, and gender. Responses from 336 pediatric psychologists demonstrated high career satisfaction. Domains of career satisfaction that received mean scores indicating high importance include balance of work and personal lives, peer/collegial support, and flexibility and choice in the workplace, but on average respondents reported being only somewhat satisfied in these domains. Total satisfaction scores were significantly higher among pediatric psychologists in 9-10 month appointments, primarily research careers, and at higher academic ranks, but scores were similar across employment settings and genders. To enhance career satisfaction and retention, pediatric psychologists may seek additional mentorship or explore new employment roles, and administrators and managers may consider adopting workplace policies or making environmental changes that could address specific areas of need.

446,"An ongoing obstacle in dealing with minority health disparities is discriminatory behavior from healthcare practitioners, also known as medical discrimination. It is not clear, however, if the effects of medical discriminations onto health are constant across space. For example, there is evidence to suspect minorities in racially segregated neighborhoods suffer less from discrimination compared to those living elsewhere. To determine the presence of spatial heterogeneity underlying medical discrimination, we implement logistic geographically weighted regression (GWR) using individual data in the city of Philadelphia from the 2006 and 2008 Public Health Management Corporation's Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Surveys. Evaluating the potential role residential segregation has in offsetting medical discrimination, we compare the GWR results to tract data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. Through this comparison, we find that the effects of medical discrimination on self-rated health are weaker in magnitude in areas that are mostly minority. However, evidence of direct health benefits for minorities in segregated communities is inconclusive. Thus, while we cannot say living in segregated neighborhoods leads to better minority health, the sting of medical discrimination can be weaker in these places. These results emphasize the importance of local variation, even within a city like Philadelphia, challenging the aspatial one-model-fits-all approach normally found in population studies.",29449905,2018,Searching for Silver Linings: Is Perceived Medical Discrimination Weaker in Segregated Areas?
447,"The design, synthesis, and electronic properties of a new series of D-π-A conjugates consisting of free base (H2P) and zinc porphyrins (ZnP) as electron donors and a fullerene (C60) as electron acceptor, in which the two electroactive entities are covalently linked through pyridine-vinylene spacers of different lengths, are described. Electronic interactions in the ground state were characterized by electrochemical and absorption measurements, which were further supported with theoretical calculations. Most importantly, charge-transfer bands were observed in the absorption spectra, indicating a strong push-pull behavior. In the excited states, electronic interactions were detected by selective photoexcitation under steady-state conditions, by time-resolved fluorescence investigations, and by pump probe experiments on the femto-, pico-, and nanosecond time scales. Porphyrin fluorescence is quenched for the different D-π-A conjugates, from which we conclude that the deactivation mechanisms of the excited singlet states are based on photoinduced energy- and/or electron transfer processes between H2P/ZnP and C60, mediated through the molecular spacers. The fluorescence intensity decreases and the fluorescence lifetimes shorten as the spacer length decreases and as the spacer substitution changes. With the help of transient absorption spectroscopy, the formation of charge-separated states involving oxidized H2P/ZnP and reduced C60 was confirmed. Lifetimes of the corresponding charge-separated states, which ranged from ∼400 picoseconds to 165 nanoseconds, depend on the spacer length, the spacer substitution, and the solvent polarity. Interestingly, D-π-A conjugates containing the longest linkers did not necessarily exhibit the longest charge-separated state lifetimes. The distances between the electron donors and the acceptors were calculated by molecular modelling. The longest charge-separated state lifetime corresponded to the D-π-A conjugate with the longest electron donor-acceptor distance. Likewise, EPR measurements in frozen media revealed charge separated states in all the D-π-A conjugates investigated. A sharp peak with g values ∼2.000 was assigned to reduced C60, while a broader, less intense signal (g ∼ 2.003) was assigned to oxidized H2P/ZnP. On-off switching of the formation and decay of the charge-separated states was detected by EPR at 77 K by repeatedly turning the irradiation source on and off.",29449913,2015,On-off switch of charge-separated states of pyridine-vinylene-linked porphyrin-C60 conjugates detected by EPR.

The fluorine atom imparts the C-F bond with low polarizability and high polarity, and significantly affects the behavior of neighboring functional groups, in a covalent or noncovalent manner. Here, we report that fluorine, present in the form of a single fluoroalkyl amino acid side chain in the P1 position of the well-characterized serine-protease inhibitor BPTI, can fully restore inhibitor activity to a mutant that contains the corresponding hydrocarbon side chain at the same site. High resolution crystal structures were obtained for four BPTI variants in complex with bovine β-trypsin, revealing changes in the stoichiometry and dynamics of water molecules in the S1 subsite. These results demonstrate that the introduction of fluorine into a protein environment can result in ""chemical complementation"" that has a significantly favorable impact on protein-protein interactions.",29449928,2015,Fluorine teams up with water to restore inhibitor activity to mutant BPTI.
449,"A methodology for controlling aggregation in highly active and isoselective indium catalysts for the ring opening polymerization of racemic lactide is reported. A series of racemic and enantiopure dinuclear indium ethoxide complexes bearing salen ligands [(ONNOR)InOEt]2 (R = Br, Me, admantyl, cumyl, t-Bu) were synthesized and fully characterized. Mononuclear analogues (ONNOR)InOCH2Pyr (R = Br, t-Bu, SiPh3) were synthesized by controlling aggregation with the use of chelating 2-pyridinemethoxide functionality. The nuclearity of metal complexes was confirmed using PGSE NMR spectroscopy. Detailed kinetic studies show a clear initiation period for these dinuclear catalysts, which is lacking in their mononuclear analogues. The polymerization behavior of analogous dinuclear and mononuclear compounds is identical and consistent with a mononuclear propagating species.

450,"Background
Rates of participation in Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) are low. This may be due, in part, to low levels of autonomous motivation (i.e., motivation that arises from internal sources and sustains healthy behaviors over time) to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among many individuals with prediabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies that incorporate principles from the Self-Determination Theory offer an effective and scalable approach to increase autonomous motivation levels. One promising mobile phone-based application is JOOL Health, which aims to help users connect certain health behaviors (e.g., sleep and diet) with personal values in specific life domains (e.g., family and work). The first aim of this study is to estimate whether JOOL Health can increase autonomous motivation to prevent T2DM among individuals with prediabetes who declined DPP participation. The second aim of this pilot study is to examine the intervention's feasibility and acceptability.


Methods
This is a 12-week, three-arm pilot randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 105 individuals with prediabetes who did not engage in a DPP despite invitation from their health plan to participate in face-to-face or web-based programs at no out-of-pocket-cost. Participants will be randomized to one of three study arms: (1) a group that receives information on prediabetes, evidence-based strategies to decrease progression to T2DM, and a list of resources for mHealth tools for monitoring diet, physical activity, and weight (comparison group); (2) a group that receives the JOOL Health application; and (3) a group that receives the JOOL Health application as well as a Fitbit activity tracker and wireless-enabled scale. Our primary outcome is change in autonomous motivation to prevent T2DM (measured using the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire). We will also collect data related to the intervention's feasibility (recruitment and retention rates) and acceptability (adherence and qualitative experience) as well as changes in psychosocial outcomes, hemoglobin A1c, and weight.


Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims to promote positive health behaviors among individuals with prediabetes who previously declined to participate in a DPP. Our results will inform a larger trial to test the effect of JOOL Health on clinically relevant outcomes, including weight loss, physical activity, and DPP engagement.

This review provides an overview of a well-documented and robust psychological construct - hindsight bias in the context of learning in healthcare simulations. Motivating this review are our observations that post-simulation debriefings may be oversimplified and biased by knowledge of scenario outcomes. Sometimes only limited consideration is given to issues that might be relevant to management in the complexity and uncertainty of real clinical practice. We use literature on hindsight bias to define the concept, inputs and implications. We offer examples from SBE where hindsight bias may occur and propose suggestions for mitigation.

452,"Effective practice is informed by underlying theoretical models. Better awareness and understanding of such models can enhance reflection by practitioners on their current educational activities and so help drive the cycle of continuing improvement. In this article the author reflects on three ways in which a better understanding of social psychology gave insights into why some practices appeared to be more effective than others and some ways in which future practice could be altered. Social psychology places great emphasis on the importance of the situation in which people find themselves an how this impacts on their subsequent behaviour. The three areas specifically addressed in the article include factors which motivate and drive human activities, especially the importance of self-esteem. Secondly, the relevance of the fundamental attribution error, which looks at our tendency as humans to ascribe personal attributes as the cause of the behaviour of others rather than the influence of external events. The third area to be explored is the role of acquiring scripts or heuristics that can broaden the range of activities than can be performed at a subconscious or intuitive level.

454,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Individual detection and intervention on CVD risk factors and behaviors throughout childhood and adolescence has been advocated as a strategy to reduce CVD risk in adulthood. The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has recently recommended universal screening of several risk factors in children and adolescents, at odds with several recommendations of the U.S. Services Task Force and of the U.K. National Screening committee. In the current review, we discuss the goals of screening for CVD risk factors (elevated blood pressure, abnormal blood lipids, diabetes) and behaviors (smoking) in children and appraise critically various screening recommendations. Our review suggests that there is no compelling evidence to recommend universal screening for elevated blood pressure, abnormal blood lipids, abnormal blood glucose, or smoking in children and adolescents. Targeted screening of these risk factors could be useful but specific screening strategies have to be evaluated. Research is needed to identify target populations, screening frequency, intervention, and follow-up. Meanwhile, efforts should rather focus on the primordial prevention of CVD risk factors and at maintaining a lifelong ideal cardiovascular health through environmental, policy, and educational approaches.",29450037,2015,Screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors beginning in childhood.
455,"Those who binge drink are at increased risk for alcohol-related consequences when compared to non-binge drinkers. Research shows individuals may face barriers to reducing their drinking behavior, but few measures exist to assess these barriers. This study created and validated the Barriers to Alcohol Reduction (BAR) scale. Participants were college students (n = 230) who endorsed at least one instance of past-month binge drinking (4+ drinks for women or 5+ drinks for men). Using classical test theory, exploratory structural equation modeling found a two-factor structure of personal/psychosocial barriers and perceived program barriers. The sub-factors, and full scale had reasonable internal consistency (i.e., coefficient omega = 0.78 (personal/psychosocial), 0.82 (program barriers), and 0.83 (full measure)). The BAR also showed evidence for convergent validity with the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (r = 0.39, p < .001) and discriminant validity with Barriers to Physical Activity (r = -0.02, p = .81). Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis showed the two factors separately met the unidimensionality assumption, and provided further evidence for severity of the items on the two factors.

Photon-correlation spectroscopy (PCS) (quasi-elastic light scattering spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy) allows the non-invasively reveal of local dynamics and local heterogeneities of macromolecular systems. The capability of this technique to diagnose the retinal pathologies by in-vivo investigations of spatial anomalies of retinas displaying non-exudative senile macular degeneration was evaluated. Further, the potential use of the technique for the diagnosis of the macular degeneration was analyzed and displayed by the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC).


METHODS
The maculae and the peripheral retina of 73 normal eyes and of 26 eyes afflicted by an early stage of non-exudative senile macular degeneration were characterized by time-correlation functions and analyzed in terms of characteristic decay times and apparent size distributions.


RESULTS
The characteristics of the obtained time-correlation functions of the eyes afflicted with nonexudative macular degeneration and of normal eyes differed significantly, which could be referred to a significant change of the nano- and microstructure of the investigated pathologic maculas.


CONCLUSIONS
Photon-correlation spectroscopy is able to assess the macromolecular and microstructural aberrations in the macula afflicted by non-exudative, senile macular degeneration.

457,"Rationale: Unconscious perception of various sensory modalities is an active subject of research though its function and effect on behavior is uncertain. Objective: The present study tried to assess if unconscious visual perception could occur with more complex visual stimuli than previously utilized. Methods and Results: Videos containing slideshows of indifferent complex images with interspersed frames of interest of various durations were presented to 24 healthy volunteers. The perception of the stimulus was evaluated with a forced-choice questionnaire while awareness was quantified by self-assessment with a modified awareness scale annexed to each question with 4 categories of awareness. At values of 16.66 ms of stimulus duration, conscious awareness was not possible and answers regarding the stimulus were random. At 50 ms, nonrandom answers were coupled with no self-reported awareness suggesting unconscious perception of the stimulus. At larger durations of stimulus presentation, significantly correct answers were coupled with a certain conscious awareness. Discussion: At values of 50 ms, unconscious perception is possible even with complex visual stimuli. Further studies are recommended with a focus on a range of interest of stimulus duration between 50 to 16.66 ms.",29450354,2016,Subliminal perception of complex visual stimuli.
458,"The purpose of this work was to develop a d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) decorated nanodiamond (ND) system loading water-insoluble curcumin (ND/CUR/TPGS) to improve the colloidal dispersity and oral bioavailability of the preparation. CUR was physically loaded into ND clusters, then TPGS was coated to the ND/CUR complex forming amorphous nanostructure on the interparticle nanocage of the ND substrate. The formulation of the nanocomplexes was optimized using response surface methodology, and the optimal ND/CUR/TPGS showed small particle size (196.32 nm), high drug loading efficiency (81.59%) and core-shell structure. In vitro release study demonstrated that the nanocomplexes provided a sustained release behavior. The absorptive concentration of ND/CUR/TPGS was dramatically improved in total intestinal tract compared with CUR suspension, and the absorption was controlled by multiple transcytosis mechanisms. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that ND/CUR/TPGS had significantly higher Cmax (4.50-fold), larger AUC0-t (10.67-fold), and longer MRT0-t (3.07-fold) in contrast with that of CUR suspension.

459,"Although the possibility of using drug-loaded ophthalmic lens to promote sustained drug release has been thoroughly pursued, there are still problems to be solved associated to the different alternatives. In this work, we went back to the traditional method of drug loading by soaking in the drug solution and tried to optimize the release profiles by changing the temperature and the time of loading. Two materials commercially available under the names of CI26Y and Definitive 50 were chosen. CI26Y is used for intraocular lenses (IOLs) and Definitive 50 for soft contact lenses (SCLs). Three drugs were tested: an antibiotic, moxifloxacin, and two anti-inflammatories, diclofenac and ketorolac. Sustained drug release from CI26Y disks for, at least 15 days, was obtained for moxifloxacin and diclofenac increasing the loading temperature up to 60 °C or extending the loading time till two months. The sustained release of ketorolac was limited to about 8 days. In contrast, drug release from Definitive 50 disks could not be improved by changing the loading conditions. An attempt to interpret the impact of the loading conditions on the drug release behavior was done using solid-state NMR and differential scanning calorimetry. These studies suggested the establishment of reversible, endothermic interactions between CI26Y and the drugs, moxifloxacin and diclofenac. The loading temperature had a slight effect on the mechanical and optical properties of drug loaded CI26Y samples, which still kept adequate properties to be used as IOL materials. The in vivo efficacy of CI26Y samples, drug loaded at 60 °C for two weeks, was predicted using a simplified mathematical model to estimate the drug concentration in the aqueous humor. The estimated concentrations were found to comply with the therapeutic needs, at least, for moxifloxacin and diclofenac.",29454097,2018,Improving sustained drug delivery from ophthalmic lens materials through the control of temperature and time of loading.
460,"BACKGROUND
The present study estimated the cost of advanced non-small cell lung cancer care for a cohort of 251 patients enrolled in a Brazilian public hospital and identified factors associated with the cost of treating the disease, considering sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral characteristics of patients, service utilization patterns and survival time.


METHODS
Estimates were obtained from the survey of direct medical cost per patient from the hospital's perspective. Data was collected from medical records and available hospital information systems. The ordinary least squares (OLS) method with logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable for the analysis of cost predictors was used to take into account the positive skewness of the costs distribution.


RESULTS
The average cost of NSCLC was US$ 5647 for patients, with 71% of costs being associated to outpatient care. The main components of cost were daily hospital bed stay (22.6%), radiotherapy (15.5%) and chemotherapy (38.5%). The OLS model reported that, with 5% significance level, patients with higher levels of education, with better physical performance and less advanced disease have higher treatment costs. After controlling for the patient's survival time, only education and service utilization patterns were statistically significant. Individuals who were hospitalized or made use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy had higher costs. The use of these outpatient and hospital services explained most of the treatment cost variation, with a significant increase of the adjusted R2 of 0.111 to 0.449 after incorporation of these variables in the model. The explanatory power of the complete model reached 62%.

Several diseases may lead to the need for liver transplantation due to progressive organ damage until the onset of cirrhosis, resulting in changes in interpersonal relationships. Social Support for transplant candidates is an important variable, providing them with psychological and social well-being. This study aims to assess social support in chronic hepatic patients, waiting for liver transplantation.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 119 patients, for convenience sampling, from the liver transplant waiting list at a Brazilian University Hospital Outpatients. The information was collected through semistructured questionnaires, in four stages: 1) socioeconomic and demographic information 2) clinical aspects 3) feelings 4) Social Support Network Inventory (SSNI), to Brazilian Portuguese. The statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA and multivariate linear regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between the scales of social support and the collected co-variables.


RESULTS
Average age was 50.2 ± 11.6, and 87 (73.1%) were men. Patients with alcohol and virus liver disease etiology had the same frequency of 28%. The MELD, without extrapoints, was 16.7 ± 4.9. Global social support family score was 3.72 ± 0.39, and Cronbach's alpha = 0.79. The multivariate analysis presented the following associations, age = [- 0.010 (95% CI = - 0.010 - -0.010); P = 0.001], etiology of hepatic disease = [- 0.212 (95% CI = - 0.37 - -0.05); P = 0.009], happiness = [- 0.214(95% CI = - 0.33 - -0.09) P = 0.001) and aggressiveness = [0.172 (95% CI = 0.040-0.030); P = 0.010).


CONCLUSIONS
The social support was greater when the patients were younger (18 to 30 years). Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, regardless of whether or not they were associated with virus, had less social support. As for feelings, the absence of happiness and the presence of aggressiveness showed a negative effect on social support.",29454342,2018,Social support for patients undergoing liver transplantation in a Public University Hospital.
462,"BACKGROUND
It is well understood that hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury during the highly vulnerable perinatal period can lead to cerebral palsy, the most prevalent cause of chronic disability in children. Recently, human clinical trials have reported safety and some efficacy following treatment of cerebral palsy using umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells. UCB is made up of many different cell types, including endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), T regulatory cells (Tregs), and monocyte-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). How each cell type contributes individually towards reducing neuroinflammation and/or repairing brain injury is not known. In this study, we examined whether human (h) UCB, or specific UCB cell types, could reduce peripheral and cerebral inflammation, and promote brain repair, when given early after perinatal HI brain injury.


METHODS
HI brain injury was induced in postnatal day (PND) 7 rat pups and cells were administered intraperitoneally on PND 8. Behavioral testing was performed 7 days post injury, and then, brains and spleens were collected for analysis.


RESULTS
We found in vitro that all UCB cell types, except for EPCs, were immunomodulatory. Perinatal HI brain injury induced significant infiltration of CD4+ T cells into the injured cerebral hemisphere, and this was significantly reduced by all hUCB cell types tested. Compared to HI, UCB, Tregs, and EPCs were able to reduce motor deficits, reduce CD4+ T cell infiltration into the brain, and reduce microglial activation. In addition to the beneficial effects of UCB, EPCs also significantly reduced cortical cell death, returned CD4+ T cell infiltration to sham levels, and reduced the peripheral Th1-mediated pro-inflammatory shift.


CONCLUSION
This study highlights that cells found in UCB is able to mediate neuroinflammation and is an effective neuroprotective therapy. Our study also shows that particular cells found in UCB, namely EPCs, may have an added advantage over using UCB alone. This work has the potential to progress towards tailored UCB therapies for the treatment of perinatal brain injury.",29454374,2018,"Effects of umbilical cord blood cells, and subtypes, to reduce neuroinflammation following perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury."
463,"BACKGROUND
Despite efforts to increase diversity in clinical trials, racial/ethnic minority groups generally remain underrepresented, limiting researchers' ability to test the efficacy and safety of new interventions across diverse populations. We describe the use of a systematic framework, intervention mapping (IM), to develop an intervention to modify recruitment behaviors of coordinators and specialist investigators with the goal of increasing diversity in trials conducted within specialty clinics. To our knowledge IM has not been used in this setting.


METHODS
The IM framework was used to ensure that the intervention components were guided by health behavior theories and the evidence. The IM steps consisted of (1) conducting a needs assessment, (2) identification of determinants and objectives, (3) selection of theory-informed methods and practical applications, (4) development and creation of program components, (5) development of an adoption and implementation plan, and (6) creation of an evaluation plan.


RESULTS
The intervention included five educational modules, one in-person and four web-based, plus technical assistance calls to coordinators. Modules addressed the intervention rationale, development of clinic-specific plans to obtain minority-serving physician referrals, physician-centered and patient-centered communication, and patient navigation. The evaluation, a randomized trial, was recently completed in 50 specialty clinics and is under analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Using IM we developed a recruitment intervention that focused on building relationships with minority-serving physicians to encourage minority patient referrals.

The results indicated that QoL, mental health problems and fatigue were interrelated, and supported the direct and indirect (through fatigue) effects of QoL on mental health problems. All domains of the WHOQOL-BREF, and particularly physical (sleep problems), psychological (negative feelings) and environmental health (leisure activities) domains, were strongly related to the mental health status of the studied nurses. Fatigue and its multiple dimensions partially mediated the relationship between QoL and mental health problems.

465,"Child neglect, whether intentional or unintentional on the part of caregivers, has serious and far-reaching negative consequences for children. Neglect is the most prevalent form of child maltreatment and has been associated with impaired cognitive development, changes in brain structure and nervous systems, behavioral and personality disorders and poor academic performance. However, the role of child neglect, and subtypes of neglect, in the development of adult violent behavior is not well understood. The ""cycle of violence"" hypothesis, which predicts that individuals exposed to child physical abuse are more likely to be physically violent in adulthood, is well supported by the literature. However, a growing number of studies suggests that child neglect may be equally predictive, or more predictive, of adult violent behavior than child physical abuse. The present review considers a range of studies that investigate aspects of this relationship, and identifies key patterns and trends that have emerged from these investigations. Methodological issues and limitations of the existing literature are also identified and new research directions suggested. This review also considers studies that support the possibility of protective factors against the development of adult violent behavior in victims of child neglect.",29454475,2018,Does childhood neglect contribute to violent behavior in adulthood?

Urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are the most common pathologies, which can be associated with changes in the mechanical properties of the supportive structures in the female pelvic cavity. PFD have been studied through different methods, from experimental tensile tests using tissues from fresh female cadavers or tissues collected at the time of a transvaginal hysterectomy procedure, or by applying imaging techniques. In this work, an inverse finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to understand the passive and active behavior of the pubovisceralis muscle (PVM) during Valsalva maneuver and muscle active contraction, respectively. Individual numerical models of women without pathology, with stress UI (SUI) and POP were built based on magnetic resonance images, including the PVM and surrounding structures. The passive and active material parameters obtained for a transversely isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model were estimated for the three groups. The values for the material constants were significantly higher for the women with POP when compared with the other two groups. The PVM of women with POP showed the highest stiffness. Additionally, the influence of these parameters was analyzed by evaluating their stress-strain, and force-displacements responses. The force produced by the PVM in women with POP was 47% and 82% higher when compared to women without pathology and with SUI, respectively.

The aim of this study was to analyse the long-term functional, subjective, and psychological results after single-digit replantation.


METHODS
Thirty cases of digital replantation (14 thumbs, 12 index fingers, 2 middle fingers, 1 ring finger, and 1 little finger) in 30 patients (7 females and 23 males) with a mean age of 44.2 years (20-65 years) were evaluated at the end of a mean follow-up time of 36 months (19-50 months). The active range of motion of joints, grip and pinch strength, cutaneous sensibility, upper-extremity functioning, and subjective satisfaction were determined using the Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and the Michigan Hand Outcomes questionnaire (MHQ). Psychological sequelae, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were assessed. A correlation analysis among variables was also performed.


RESULTS
The mean score for the DASH questionnaire was 6.6 (range: 0-39.2). The symptom of cold intolerance occurred in 53% of the patients. Two patients were diagnosed with depression, and only one patient exhibited PTSD. The DASH score had a good statistical correlation with total grip strength, pinch grip strength, and static two-point discrimination (S-2PD) (P < 0.05). Several aspects of the MHQ were also statistically relevant to some or all of the three objective results. Furthermore, the grip strength showed significant correlation with DASH and most aspects of the MHQ in multivariate logistic regression analysis (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Total grip strength is the most important factor positively related to subjective outcomes. The incidence rates of psychological symptoms after digit replantation are very low at long-term follow-up.

470,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The time-course for the development of clinically significant hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is unpredictable. Little is known about the progression from pre-clinical, indolent lesions to widely invasive, aggressive phenotypes. Gastro-endoscopy often fails to detect early lesions and risk-reducing/prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) is the only curative approach. We present a HDGC family with early-onset disease, in which clinical and histological findings provided insight into the understanding of different HDGC phenotypes.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The proband was diagnosed at the age of 18 years with widely invasive, metastatic DGC. CDH1 genetic testing identified a pathogenic, germline CDH1-mutation (c.1901C>T, p.Ala634Val). Thirty family members were tested and 15 CDH1 carriers were identified. Six of them had PTG, with negative preoperative work-up. The proband's 14-year-old sister is the youngest patient, reported to date, to have PTG after negative preoperative biopsies. Intramucosal HDGC foci were detected in all PTG specimens (n=1-33). In contrast to the ""indolent"" phenotype of these foci, the aggressive DGC from the proband showed pleomorphic cells, absent E-cadherin expression, increased proliferation (Ki-67 index) and activation of oncogenic events (p53, pSrc and pStat3 overexpression). All family members had Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Cag-A-positive strains were detected in all specimens, except in the proband's sister.


CONCLUSIONS
HDGC is a heterogeneous disease regarding clinical behavior, endoscopic findings, histopathologic features, and immunophenotypic/molecular profile. The presence of bizarre, pleomorphic cells in endoscopic biopsy specimens is suggestive of advanced disease and should prompt clinical intervention. The involvement of a full multidisciplinary team is essential for the management of these patients.",29454568,2018,The phenotypic heterogeneity of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: the report of one family with early-onset disease.
471,"OBJECTIVE
The incidence of depression is significantly compounded by obesity. Obesity arising from excessive intake of high-fat food provokes anxiodepressive behavior and elicits molecular adaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region well-implicated in the hedonic deficits associated with depression and in the control of food-motivated behavior. To determine the etiology of diet-induced depression, we studied the impact of different dietary lipids on anxiodepressive behavior and metabolic and immune outcomes and the contribution of NAc immune activity.


METHODS
Adult C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to isocaloric high-fat/high-sucrose diets (HFD), enriched in either saturated or monounsaturated fat, or a control low-fat diet (LFD). Metabolic responses, anxiodepressive behavior, and plasma and NAc inflammatory markers were assessed after 12 weeks. In separate experiments, an adenoviral construct inhibiting IKKβ, an upstream component of the nuclear factor kappa-b (NFkB) pathway, was a priori injected into the NAc.


RESULTS
Both HFDs resulted in obesity and hyperleptinemia; however, the saturated HFD uniquely triggered anxiety-like behavior, behavioral despair, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, peripheral inflammation, and multiple pro-inflammatory signs in the NAc, including reactive gliosis, increased expression of cytokines, antigen-presenting markers and NFкB transcriptional activity. Selective NAc IKKβ inhibition reversed the upregulated expression of inflammatory markers, prevented anxiodepressive behavior and blunted compulsive sucrose-seeking in mice fed the saturated HFD.


CONCLUSIONS
Metabolic inflammation and NFкB-mediated neuroinflammatory responses in the NAc contribute to the expression of anxiodepressive behavior and heightened food cravings caused by a diet high in saturated fat and sugar.",29454579,2018,Nucleus accumbens inflammation mediates anxiodepressive behavior and compulsive sucrose seeking elicited by saturated dietary fat.
472,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this paper was to assess the effects of zoledronate (ZOL) and alendronate (FOS) on apoptotic behavior and gene expression of pro- and inflammatory cytokines of three cell types (human osteoblasts, human gingival fibroblasts and human osteogenic sarcoma cell lines) during a period of 4 weeks.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell viability and proliferation was assessed via cell proliferation test (MTT), fluorescence diacetate analysis (FDA). Expression of inflammatory cytokines was investigated by using polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
The proliferation and cell vitality of osteoblasts and fibroblasts were negatively affected in a dose dependent manner under ZOL and FOS administration. Osteosarcoma cells showed an increase in proliferation under lower doses of BP. ZOL had a significantly higher cytotoxic effect compared with FOS on osteoblasts and fibroblasts. ZOL increased the production of IL-6 in all cell types, whereas FOS only in osteosarcoma cell, which happened in dose dependent manner. Bisphosphonates could result in increase of IL-1β expression of fibroblasts. An increase of IL-12 was observed at higher doses of ZOL administration among osteoblasts and FOS administration in osteosarcoma cells.

ZOL and FOS could encourage cytotoxic and inflammatory reactions.",29454604,2018,"Cytotoxic and inflammatory effects of alendronate and zolendronate on human osteoblasts, gingival fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells."
473,"Wikipedia is the most commonly accessed source of health information by both healthcare professionals and the lay public worldwide. We aimed to evaluate information-seeking behavior of Internet users searching the Italian Wikipedia for articles related to epilepsy and its treatment. Using Pageviews Analysis, we assessed the total and mean monthly views of articles from the Italian Wikipedia devoted to epilepsy, epileptic syndromes, seizure type, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017. We compared the views of the article on epilepsy with those of articles focusing on Alzheimer's disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis, syncope, and stroke and adjusted all results for crude disease prevalence. With the only exception of the article on multiple sclerosis, the adjusted views for the Italian Wikipedia article on epilepsy were higher than those for the other neurological disorders. The most viewed articles on seizure type were devoted to tonic-clonic seizure, typical absence seizure, tonic convulsive seizures, and clonic convulsive seizures. The most frequently accessed articles on epilepsy syndromes were about temporal lobe epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The most frequently viewed articles on AEDs were devoted to valproic acid, carbamazepine, and levetiracetam. Wikipedia searches seem to mirror patients' fears and worries about epilepsy more than its actual epidemiology. The ultimate reasons for searching online remain unknown.

474,"Down syndrome (DS) results from the triplication of genes located on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Though many cognitive and behavioral impairments are associated with DS, sleep disturbances remain poorly understood despite being a reported phenotype in approximately 60% of individuals diagnosed with DS. In this study, sleep and electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations were recorded from aged (12-14 mos.) Dp(16)1Yey/+ mice (Dp16), a mouse model of DS. We observed disrupted sleep demonstrated by increased activity during the dark phase and increased time awake at the expense of NREM sleep compared to wild-type mice. In addition, we found that Dp16 mice display significant differences in relative EEG power distribution among oscillation frequencies in both sleep and awake states. These results in Dp16 mice are consistent with sleep disturbances found in individuals with DS, and the abnormal EEG oscillations in aged Dp16 mice suggest a potential role for GABAergic activity in these sleep and EEG abnormalities. These sleep and EEG data reflect underlying differences in neuronal activity at the network level and thus are causative agents rather than merely symptoms of DS.",29454635,2018,Sleep behavior and EEG oscillations in aged Dp(16)1Yey/+mice: a Down syndrome model.
475,"Most reward-related electroencephalogram (EEG) studies focus exclusively on the feedback-related negativity (FRN, also known as feedback negativity or FN, medial-frontal negativity or MFN, feedback error-related negativity or fERN, and reward positivity or RewP). This component is usually measured approximately 200-300 ms post-feedback at a single electrode in the frontal-central area (e.g., Fz or FCz). The present review argues that this singular focus on the FRN fails to leverage EEG's greatest strength, its temporal resolution, by underutilizing the rich variety of event-related potential (ERP) and EEG time-frequency components encompassing the wider temporal heterogeneity of reward processing. The primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of often overlooked ERP and EEG correlates beyond the FRN in the context of reward processing with the secondary goal of guiding future research toward multistage experimental designs and multicomponent analyses that leverage the temporal power of EEG. We comprehensively review reward-related ERPs (including the FRN, readiness potential or RP, stimulus-preceding negativity or SPN, contingent-negative variation or CNV, cue-related N2 and P3, Feedback-P3, and late-positive potential or LPP/slow-wave), and reward-related EEG time-frequency components (changes in power at alpha, beta, theta, and delta bands). These electrophysiological signatures display distinct time-courses, scalp topographies, and reflect independent psychological processes during anticipatory and/or outcome stages of reward processing. Special consideration is given to the time-course of each component and factors that significantly contribute to component variation. Concluding remarks identify current limitations along with recommendations for potential important future directions.",29454641,2018,Beyond the FRN: Broadening the time-course of EEG and ERP components implicated in reward processing.
476,"Previous research indicated that the skin conductance response (SCR) of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) in the Concealed Information Test (CIT) is typically increased in subjects who are financially and otherwise incentivized to defeat the CIT (the paradoxical ""motivational impairment"" effect). This is not the case for RT-based CITs, nor for P300 tests based on the 3-stimulus protocol or Complex Trial Protocol for detection of cognitive malingering (although these are not the same as forensic CITs). The present report extends earlier studies of malingerers by running five groups of subjects (15-16 per group yielding 78 total) in a mock crime (forensic) scenario: paid (to beat the test) and unpaid, instructed and uninstructed, and simply guilty. There was no evidence that the ""CIT effect"" (probe-minus-irrelevant P300 differences) differed among groups, although behavioral differences among groups were seen.",29454642,2018,"Moderate financial incentive does not appear to influence the P300 Concealed Information Test (CIT) effect in the Complex Trial Protocol (CTP) version of the CIT in a forensic scenario, while affecting P300 peak latencies and behavior."
477,"The consolidation of behavioral sequences into relatively ballistic habits is thought to involve the formation of stimulus - response associations. Typically, the stimuli in these associations are assumed to be exteroceptive, i.e., external to the organism. However, responses, themselves, also possess stimulus properties that can mediate behavior. Indeed, these ""proprioceptive cues"" have long been hypothesized to underlie habit formation (Hull, 1934a, 1934b). One such stimulus involves the time durations between responses - a stimulus termed interresponse time (IRT). We hypothesize that IRTs can come to serve as stimuli that differentially control response elements during habit formation. To examine this hypothesis we report on two experiments that asked whether CD-1 mice utilize IRTs to structure behavior in a two-choice environment. In experiment 1, eight mice were exposed to a free-operant concurrent variable-interval (VI) 30-s VI 60-s reinforcement schedule. We found that switch and stay responses were differentially correlated with IRT durations. In Experiment 2 we directly and differentially reinforced stay / switch responses based on IRT durations in a two-lever procedure. For four of the subjects, the probability of receiving reinforcement after switch responses was proportional to IRT duration. For five of the subjects, these reinforcement probabilities were inversely proportional to IRT duration. Regardless, all of our subjects learned to emit IRT-mediated switching behavior that matched the reinforcement contingencies. Together, Experiments 1 and 2 provide the first evidence of which we are aware that IRTs can come to control sequential choice behavior in mice.",29454643,2018,Proprioceptive Stimuli and habit formation: Interresponse time mediated behavior in CD-1 mice.

However, detailed neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the body-brain interactions remain unknown. In this study, we developed a method for manipulating activity levels of the heart using direct cardiac stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation that can be combined with recording cerebral local field potentials using a microdrive system, electrocardiograms, electromyograms, in a freely moving rat. With this method, the electrical stimulation to the heart increases heart rates up to 14 Hz, whereas the vagus nerve stimulation decreases heart rates to 3 Hz. Transient electrical artifacts arising from the peripheral stimulation are not contaminated in cortical local field potential signals low-pass filtered at 150 Hz and distinguishable from extracellular multiunit signals.

479,"Associations of electronically recorded data were examined before diagnosis of health disorders in early-lactation cows in herds with automated milking systems (AMS). Rumination time, activity, and milk yield data were collected for 8 mo for 605 early-lactation cows in 9 commercial AMS herds. Using multivariable generalized linear regression models controlling for parity and days in milk, data were examined relative to the day of diagnosis for health disorders occurring in absence of, or at least 14 d before, another disorder: mastitis (n = 13), new cases of lameness (n = 45), subclinical ketosis (SCK; n = 113), and purulent vaginal discharge (n = 49). All cases of displaced abomasum (DA; n = 8) occurred in conjunction with other disorders. Deviations from baseline among affected cows were examined, as well as differences compared with a group of healthy cows and an average group of all cows, who were given mock diagnosis days using the mean days in milk at diagnosis for each disorder. On 6 to 14 d of the 2 wk before diagnosis, cows with DA or mastitis had lower milk yield, rumination time, milking frequency, activity, and milk temperature compared with healthy cows as well as deviations from their own baseline rumination time and milk yield starting 4 to 12 d before diagnosis. Cows with DA had lower AMS supplement intake than healthy cows and deviations from their baseline activity and milk temperature starting 6 and 4 d before diagnosis, respectively. Cows with mastitis had greater milk conductivity than healthy cows and deviated from their baseline milking frequency and conductivity 8 and 12 d before diagnosis, respectively. Compared with healthy cows, those with SCK or new cases of lameness generally had lower milk yield, rumination time, milk temperature, supplement intake, and milking and refusal frequencies. Only the milk temperature of lame cows deviated from baseline. Thus, acute health disorders (i.e., DA and mastitis) were associated with deviations from those cows' baseline AMS data, whereas more chronic disorders (i.e., SCK and lameness) were associated with significant but subtle longer term changes in milk production and behavior. Because cows with health disorders deviated from a group of healthy cows before they deviated from their own baseline and from the average of all other cows, including a healthy reference group in health alerts could refine the ability of detection models to identify subtle deviations in early lactation.",29454684,2018,Behavior and productivity of cows milked in automated systems before diagnosis of health disorders in early lactation.
480,"The objectives of the study were (1) to test whether 6 h of feed deprivation followed by refeeding induces an acidosis challenge in dairy cattle and (2) to quantify the acidosis challenge mitigation potential of increased alfalfa silage concentration in the diet. Alfalfa silage constituted either 25 or 75% of forage dry matter (DM) replacing corn silage [low (LA) or high alfalfa (HA)] and was chopped to either 14 or 19 mm theoretical length [short (S) or long (L)]. Dietary treatments LAS, LAL, HAS, or HAL were offered to 4 rumen-cannulated Holstein dairy cattle (161 d in milk; 5th or 6th parity) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design study with 21-d periods. Starch concentration was 69 g/kg of DM higher for LA diets than HA diets. Feed was withheld for 6 h followed by ad libitum refeeding on d 18 of each period. Measurements of DM intake, milk yield and composition, rumen pH, and eating and rumination behavior were taken on 1 baseline day, the challenge day, and 2 further recovery days. After refeeding, rumen pH was reduced in cows fed LA diets but not HA diets. Feeding LAL resulted in the greatest subclinical acidosis risk (pH <5.8 for 355 min on the first recovery day). Animals fed LA produced 4.4 L less milk on the challenge day in comparison to baseline. It was concluded that short-term feed deprivation detrimentally affected rumen health and milk yield in dairy cattle normally fed ad libitum, but had no effect on DM intake or milk composition. Feeding alfalfa silage in place of corn silage mitigated acidosis risk due to interrupted feed supply, likely due to a combination of lower starch concentration in HA diets, greater effective fiber concentration, and higher buffering capacity of alfalfa relative to corn silage.",29454691,2018,The effect of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) silage chop length and inclusion rate within a total mixed ration on the ability of lactating dairy cows to cope with a short-term feed withholding and refeeding challenge.
481,"Different studies have shown a strong correlation between the rumen microbiome and a range of production traits (e.g., feed efficiency, milk yield and components) in dairy cows. Underlying dynamics concerning cause and effect are, however, still widely unknown and warrant further investigation. The aim of the current study was to describe possible functional interrelations and pathways using a large set of variables describing the production, the metabolic and immunological state, as well as the rumen microbiome and fermentation characteristics of dairy cows in early lactation (n = 36, 56 ± 3 d in milk). It was further hypothesized that the feed intake-associated behavior may influence the ruminal fermentation pattern, and a set of variables describing these individual animal attributes was included. Principal component analysis as well as Spearman's rank correlations were conducted including a total of 265 variables. The attained plots describe several well-known associations between metabolic, immunological, and production traits. Main drivers of variance within the data set included milk production and efficiency as well as rumen fermentation and microbiome diversity attributes, whereas behavioral, metabolic, and immunological variables did not exhibit any strong interrelations with the other variables. The previously well-documented strong correlation of production traits with distinct prokaryote groups was confirmed. This mainly included a negative correlation of operational taxonomic units ascribed to the Prevotella genus with milk and fat yield and feed efficiency. A central role of the animals' feed intake behavior in this context could not be affirmed. Furthermore, different methodological and interpretability aspects concerning the microbiome analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, such as the discrepancy between taxonomic classification and functional communality, as well as the comparability with other studies, are discussed. We concluded that, to further investigate the driving force that causes the difference between efficient and inefficient animals, studies including more sophisticated methods to describe phenotypical traits of the host (e.g., rumen physiology, metabolic and genetic aspects) as well as the rumen microbiome (e.g., metagenome, metatranscriptome, metaproteome, and metabolome analysis) are needed.",29454699,2018,"Interrelations between the rumen microbiota and production, behavioral, rumen-fermentation, metabolic, and immunological attributes of dairy cows."
482,"BACKGROUND
A significant burn can severely impact the lives of survivors and their carers. This systematic review sought to incorporate the experiences of guilt, blame and shame across the lifespan for burn survivors, their families as well as the experiences of the parents of burned children.


METHODS
A systematic review of qualitative studies on the experiences and perspectives of guilt, blame and shame by those affected by burn trauma across the lifespan. The databases, Pubmed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO were systematically searched. Authors independently rated the reporting of the qualitative studies included. Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the data. The search identified 230 papers. Eighteen research papers met the study inclusion criteria.


RESULTS
Guilt and ruminations of guilt, blame attribution and shame and body image were identified during thematic analysis as pivotal factors across the lifespan for burn survivors, their families as well as the experiences of the parents of burn injured children. Accounts presented, suggest that the impact of burns on the lives of the survivor and family covers a diverse spectrum of impact; personal, cultural and societal.


CONCLUSION
From the findings of the literature searches and the post-burn experiences described in this review there is a gap in the psychological care for burn survivors and their caregivers. This is specifically relevant around issues of parental guilt and blame, ruminations of guilt and shame as well as body image. These findings may not be new to burns professionals but the key message is that management of these issues fall short of delivering comprehensive post trauma care. Identifying and highlighting the importance of residual psychosocial problems will ultimately influence positive outcomes for burn survivors.",29454710,2018,"Experiences of guilt, shame and blame in those affected by burns: A qualitative systematic review."

Arthropod vectors have evolved as excellent bloodsuckers, providing an elegant transportation mode for a wide number of infectious agents. The nature of pathogen and parasite transfer and the models used to predict how a disease might spread are magnified in complexity when an arthropod vector is part of the disease cycle. One Health is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. It would benefit from a structured analysis to address vectoring of arthropod-borne diseases as a dynamic transactional process. This review focused on how arthropod vector data can be used to better model and predict zoonotic disease outbreaks. With enhanced knowledge to describe arthropod vector disease transfer, researchers will have a better understanding about how to model disease outbreaks. As public health research evolves to include more social-ecological systems, the roles of society, ecology, epidemiology, pathogen/parasite evolution and animal behavior can be better captured in the research design.

484,"Preventing or reducing negative effects on the environment from the waste landfilling is the main goal defined by the European Landfill Directive. Generally geopolymers can be considered as sustainable binders for immobilization of hazardous wastes containing different toxic elements. In this paper the influence of addition of high amount of lead on structure, strength, and leaching behavior (the effectiveness of Pb immobilization) of fly ash-based geopolymers depending on the geopolymer curing conditions was investigated. Lead was added during the synthesis of geopolymers in the form of highly soluble salt - lead-nitrate. Structural changes of geopolymers as a result of lead addition/immobilization were assessed by means of XRD, SEM/EDS, and 29Si MAS NMR analysis. Investigated curing conditions significantly influenced structure, strength and leaching behavior of geopolymers. High addition of lead caused a sizeable decrease in compressive strength of geopolymers and promoted formation of aluminum-deficient aluminosilicate gel (depolymerization of aluminosilicate gel), regardless of the curing conditions investigated. According to the EUWAC limitations, 4% of lead was successfully immobilized by fly ash-based geopolymers cured for 28 days in a humid chamber at room temperature.",29454801,2018,The influence of Pb addition on the properties of fly ash-based geopolymers.

We collected serum and saliva from 32 healthy women and measured leptin, estradiol, and progesterone. Participants also completed surveys of demographics, health and sexual behaviors, and physical activity. Leptin was predicted by meals per day and missed meals at both menses and ovulation. However, estradiol and physical activity were stronger predictors of leptin at menses, while sexual activity was a stronger predictor of leptin at ovulation.

486,"INTRODUCTION
Previous research has shown reductions in cigarette consumption during the pre-quit period of exercise-aided smoking cessation interventions. Smoking topography and sensation patterns during this period is unknown and may provide valuable insight into compensation and cessation readiness.


METHODS
Female smokers (N = 236, M age = 43, M cigarettes/day = 17.0) enrolled in an exercise-aided smoking cessation intervention self-reported daily cigarette use and cigarette sensory experiences. Breath carbon monoxide and smoking topography data were collected during the period leading up to the targeted quit date (i.e., baseline, week 1, and week 3), which was set for week 4.


RESULTS
Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that cigarette consumption (p < 0.001, eta = 0.32), carbon monoxide (p < 0.001, eta = 0.14), puff duration (p = 0.01, eta = 0.05), smoking satisfaction (p < 0.001, eta = 0.34), psychological reward (p < 0.001, eta = 0.43), enjoyment of respiratory tract sensations (p < 0.001, eta = 0.29), and craving (p < 0.001, eta = 0.39) decreased, whereas average puff flow (p = 0.01, eta = 0.05) increased.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to establish that regular exercise during the pre-quit period served as a conduit for facilitating behavioral and sensory harm reduction with cigarettes. Furthermore, the pattern of change observed between cigarette consumption and smoking topography does not support compensation. These findings imply that female smokers who exercise prior to a quit attempt are in a favourable state to achieve cessation.",29454814,2018,Smoking behaviour and sensations during the pre-quit period of an exercise-aided smoking cessation intervention.
487,"Compelling evidence indicates that hypocretin/orexin signaling regulates arousal, stress and reward-seeking behaviors. However, most studies on drug reward-related processes have so far described the effects of pharmacological blockers disrupting hypocretin/orexin transmission. We report here an extensive study on cocaine-related behaviors in hypocretin/orexin-deficient mice (KO) and their heterozygous (HET) and wildtype (WT) littermates. We evaluated behavioral sensitization following repeated administrations and preference for an environment repeatedly paired with cocaine injections (15 mg/kg). Mice were also trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/infusion). Our observations show that whereas all mice exhibited quite similar responses to acute administration of cocaine, only Hcrt KO mice exhibited reduced cocaine-seeking behaviors following a period of abstinence or extinction, and reduced cocaine incubation craving. Further, if the present findings confirm that Hcrt deficient mice may display a hypoactive phenotype, possibly linked to a reduced alertness concomitant to a decreased exploration of their environment, hypocretin/orexin defiency did not cause any attentional deficit. We thus report that innate disruption of hypocretin/orexin signaling moderately alters cocaine reward but significantly reduces long-term affective dependence that may explain the lack of relapse for cocaine seeking seen in Hcrt KO mice. Overall, with blunted cocaine intake at the highest concentration and reduced responsiveness to cocaine cues after prolonged abstinence, our findings suggest that hypocretin deficient mice may display signs of resilience to cocaine addiction.",29454841,2018,Hypocretin/orexin deficiency decreases cocaine abuse liability.
488,"Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a commonly and widely used industrial and laboratory chemical reagent that is highly toxic. Its availability and rapid harmful/lethal effects combine to make cyanide a potential foodborne/waterborne intentional-poisoning hazard. Thus, laboratory studies are needed to understand the dose-dependent progression of toxicity/lethality following ingestion of cyanide-poisoned foods/liquids. We developed an oral-dosing method in which a standard pipette was used to dispense a sodium cyanide solution into the cheek, and the rat then swallowed the solution. Following poisoning (4-128 mg/kg), overt toxic signs were recorded and survival was evaluated periodically up to 30 hours thereafter. Toxic signs for NaCN doses higher than 16 mg/kg progressed quickly from head burial and mastication, to lethargy, convulsions, gasping/respiratory distress, and death. In a follow-on study, trained operant-behavioral performance was assessed immediately following cyanide exposure (4-64 mg/kg) continuously for 5 h and again the following day. Onset of behavioral intoxication (i.e., behavioral suppression) occurred more rapidly and lasted longer as the NaCN dose increased. This oral-consumption method with concomitant operantbehavioral assessment allowed for accurate dosing and quantification of intoxication onset, severity, and recovery, and will also be valuable in characterizing similar outcomes following varying medical countermeasure drugs and doses.",29454866,2018,"Behavioral toxicity of sodium cyanide following oral ingestion in rats: Dose-dependent onset, severity, survival, and recovery."
489,"Diminished cognitive and mood function are among the most conspicuous symptoms of Gulf WarIllness(GWI). Our previous studies in a rat model of GWI have demonstrated that persistent cognitive and mood impairments are associated with substantially declined neurogenesis, chronic low-grade inflammation, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus. We tested the efficacy of curcumin (CUR) to maintain better cognitive and mood function in a rat model of GWI because of its neurogenic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and memory and mood enhancing properties. Male rats were exposed daily to low doses of GWI-related chemicals, pyridostigmine bromide, N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and permethrin, and 5-minutes of restraint stress for 28 days. Animals were next randomly assigned to two groups, which received daily CUR or vehicle treatment for 30 days. Animals also received 5'-bromodeoxyuridine during the last seven days of treatment for analysis of neurogenesis. Behavioral studies through object location, novel object recognition and novelty suppressed feeding tests performed sixty days after treatment revealed better cognitive and mood function in CUR treated GWI rats. These rats also displayed enhanced neurogenesis and diminished inflammation typified by reduced astrocyte hypertrophy and activated microglia in the hippocampus. Additional studies showed that CUR treatment to GWI rats enhanced the expression of antioxidant genes and normalized the expression of multiple genes related to mitochondrial respiration. Thus, CUR therapy is efficacious for maintaining better memory and mood function in a model of GWI. Enhanced neurogenesis, restrained inflammation and oxidative stress with normalized mitochondrial respiration may underlie better memory and mood function mediated by CUR treatment.",29454881,2018,"Curcumin Treatment Leads to Better Cognitive and Mood Function in a Model of Gulf War Illness with Enhanced Neurogenesis, and Alleviation of Inflammation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Hippocampus."

Task performance did not differ between groups. Functional MRI activation in Big-C and SCG groups differed during the divergent thinking task. No differences in activation were seen during the convergent thinking task. Big-C groups had less activation than SCG in frontal pole, right frontal operculum, left middle frontal gyrus, and bilaterally in occipital cortex. SCI displayed lower frontal and parietal activation relative to the SCG when generating alternate uses in the AUT, while VIS displayed lower frontal activation than SCI and SCG when generating typical qualities (the control condition in the AUT). VIS showed more activation in right inferior frontal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus relative to SCI. All groups displayed considerable overlapping activation during the RAT. The results confirm substantial overlap in functional activation across groups, but suggest that exceptionally creative individuals may depend less on task-positive networks during tasks that demand divergent thinking.",29454896,2018,Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Divergent and Convergent Thinking in Big-C Creativity.

492,"Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) provides imaging biomarkers of task-independent brain function that can be associated with clinical variables or modulated by interventions such as behavioral training or pharmacological manipulations. These biomarkers include time-averaged regional brain function as manifested by regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured using arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI and correlated temporal fluctuations of function across brain networks with either ASL or blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Resting-state studies are typically carried out using just one of several prescribed state conditions such as eyes closed (EC), eyes open (EO), or visual fixation on a cross-hair (FIX), which may affect the reliability and specificity of rs-fMRI. In this study, we collected test-retest ASL MRI data during 4 resting-state task conditions: EC, EO, FIX and PVT (low-frequency psychomotor vigilance task), and examined the effects of these task conditions on reliability and reproducibility as well as trait specificity of regional brain function. We also acquired resting-state BOLD fMRI under FIX and compared the network connectivity reliabilities between the four ASL conditions and the BOLD FIX condition. For resting-state ASL data, EC provided the highest CBF reliability, reproducibility, trait specificity, and network connectivity reliability, followed by EO, while FIX was lowest on all of these measures. PVT demonstrated lower CBF reliability, reproducibility and trait specificity than EO and EC. Overall network connectivity reliability was comparable between ASL and BOLD. Our findings confirm ASL CBF as a reliable, stable, and consistent measure of resting-state regional brain function and support the use of EC or EO over FIX and PVT as the resting-state condition.",29454933,2018,"Effects of resting state condition on reliability, trait specificity, and network connectivity of brain function measured with arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI."
493,"Functional connectivity analysis is an essential tool for understanding brain function. Previous studies showed that brain regions are functionally connected through low-frequency signals both within the default mode network (DMN) and task networks. However, no studies have directly compared the time scale (frequency) properties of network connectivity during task versus rest, or examined how they relate to task performance. Here, using fMRI data collected from sixty-eight subjects at rest and during a stop signal task, we addressed this issue with a novel functional connectivity measure based on detrended partial cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA). DPCCA has the advantage of quantifying correlations between two variables in different time scales while controlling for the influence of other variables. The results showed that the time scales of within-network connectivity of the DMN and task networks are modulated in opposite directions across rest and task, with the time scale increased during rest vs. task in the DMN and vice versa in task networks. In regions of interest analysis, the within-network connectivity time scale of the pre-supplementary motor area - a medial prefrontal cortical structure of the task network critical to proactive inhibitory control - correlated inversely with Barratt impulsivity and stop signal reaction time. Together, these findings demonstrate that time scale properties of brain networks may vary across mental states and provide evidence in support of a role of low frequency fluctuations of BOLD signals in behavioral control.",29454934,2018,Time scale properties of task and resting-state functional connectivity: Detrended partial cross correlation analysis.
494,"Although single-cell RNA sequencing can reliably detect large-scale transcriptional programs, it is unclear whether it accurately captures the behavior of individual genes, especially those that express only in rare cells. Here, we use single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization as a gold standard to assess trade-offs in single-cell RNA-sequencing data for detecting rare cell expression variability. We quantified the gene expression distribution for 26 genes that range from ubiquitous to rarely expressed and found that the correspondence between estimates across platforms improved with both transcriptome coverage and increased number of cells analyzed. Further, by characterizing the trade-off between transcriptome coverage and number of cells analyzed, we show that when the number of genes required to answer a given biological question is small, then greater transcriptome coverage is more important than analyzing large numbers of cells. More generally, our report provides guidelines for selecting quality thresholds for single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments aimed at rare cell analyses.",29454938,2018,Rare Cell Detection by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing as Guided by Single-Molecule RNA FISH.
495,"The perceptual load hypothesis posits that early and late selection occurs under conditions of high and low perceptual load, respectively. Recent work, however, suggests that the absence of a congruency effect in high-load trials - the behavioral signature of early selection in studies of perceptual load - may not provide an exhaustive index of failing to identify task-irrelevant distractors. Prior research also suggests that the congruency sequence effect (CSE) - a modulation of the congruency effect after incongruent relative to congruent trials - provides complementary information about whether participants identify distractors. We therefore conducted a novel test of the perceptual load hypothesis that employed both the congruency effect and the CSE as measures of distractor identification. Experiment 1 revealed that distractors were identified not only in low-load trials but also in high-load trials wherein there was no overall congruency effect. Experiment 2 further revealed which task parameters allowed us to observe such ""hidden"" distractor identification. These findings suggest that perceptual load is not always a crucial determinant of early versus late selection.",29454940,2018,Perceptual load is not always a crucial determinant of early versus late selection.
496,"Polyvalent gold nanoparticle oligonucleotide conjugates are subject of intense research. Even though 2nm diameter AuNPs have been previously modified with DNA, little is known about their structure and electrochemical behavior. In this work, we examine the influence of different surface modification strategies on the interplay between the meso-organization and the molecular recognition properties of a 27-mer DNA strand. This DNA strand is functionalized with different sulfur-containing moieties and immobilized on 2nm gold nanoparticles confined on a nanoporous alumina, working the whole system as an electrode array. Surface coverages were determined by EXAFS and the performance as recognition elements for impedance-based sensors is evaluated. Our results prove that low DNA coverages on the confined nanoparticles prompt to a more sensitive response, showing the relevance in avoiding the DNA strand overcrowding. The system was able to determine a concentration as low as 100pM of the complementary strand, thus introducing the foundations for the construction of label-free genosensors at the nanometer scale.",29454941,2018,Characterization and electrochemical response of DNA functionalized 2nm gold nanoparticles confined in a nanochannel array.
497,"Dextran based bionanocomposite membranes encapsulating clove oil (CO) and sandalwood oil (SO) that are capable of preventing infection due to their inherent virtue of antibacterial activity and modifying the wound healing cascade for accelerated scar free healing, were developed. A facile solvent casting technique was used to fabricate dextran/nanosoy/glycerol/chitosan (DNG/Ch) nanocomposite membranes followed by subsequent addition of CO and SO to obtain DNG/Ch/CO and DNG/Ch/SO herbal nanodressings. Dressings exhibited >98% antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) at extremely low loadings of 5% and 10% for CO and SO, respectively. This encapsulation strategy allowed controlled diffusion of EO over a period of 72 h which was measured in terms of drug efficacy using bacterial reduction count test and serial plate transfer disk diffusion test (SPTDDT). Swelling behavior and mechanical properties were also examined. Bacterial adherence study was performed to demonstrate the efficiency of dressings for arresting microbial invasion. In vivo wound healing studies were conducted using male swiss albino mice of BALB/c strain and DNG/Ch/CO dressings exhibited complete healing within 14 days with remarkable efficacy in scar prevention.

498,"Tissue engineering requires the design and manufacture of biomimetic scaffolds. Collagen-derived nanofibrous scaffolds have been intensively studied because collagen, in the form of fibrils, is one of the main components of the extra cellular matrix (ECM). Several collagen materials have been used in electrospinning studies including mammalian extracted Type I collagen and gelatin formulations. Denatured whole chain collagen (DWCC) can be prepared by heat denaturing acid-soluble collagen extracted from cold-water fish skin. This product provides a consistent source of collagen with a controlled molecular weight profile and intact alpha chains including telopeptides. In this work, we studied DWCC-water-acid systems in order to determine the effect of solution composition on nanofibre morphology. Whereas measurement of the classical physical properties of concentrated solutions failed to predict and only partially explained the electrospinning behavior of collagen derived polymers, hydrodynamic properties provided insight. All the samples are presented in ternary diagrams to map the electrospinnability of the systems. These ""electrospinning maps"" provide an informative resource to electrospinning collagen-derived product for biomedical or commercial applications and a practical alternative to complicated models developed for synthetic polymers.",29454947,2018,Guide to electrospinning denatured whole chain collagen from hoki fish using benign solvents.
499,"Several natural and synthetic polysaccharides are able to form, under appropriate conditions, supramolecular structures, typically physical hydrogels, and, together with their biocompatibility, this explains their wide use in food, pharmaceutical and biomedical sectors. In the case of high methoxyl pectins (HMP) the gel formation is promoted by the presence of cosolutes (sugars or polyols) and low pH. The present investigation mainly regards the structuring kinetics of aqueous HMP solutions at acid pH (3.1) with the same pectin concentration (0.2% w/w) and different sucrose concentrations (from 56 to 65% w/w). Preliminary viscosity tests were performed to individuate the threshold of the sol region. A sequence of consecutive frequency sweeps was applied to each sample immediately after its preparation. The time evolution of the linear viscoelastic behavior is described by the sigmoidal profiles of both moduli at each applied frequency and more thoroughly defined through the change of the mechanical spectrum, i.e. the variation of the parameters of the generalized Maxwell model or the Friedrich-Braun model which are both suitable to provide a satisfactory data fitting.

We outline a model where prefrontal subregions modulate behavior along orthogonal motor dimensions, and exhibit connectivity that selects for expression of one behavioral strategy while inhibiting the other.",29454957,2018,Mixed selectivity encoding and action selection in the prefrontal cortex during threat assessment.
501,"OBJECTIVE
Arsenic is a well-known environmental contaminant, causing toxicity in different organs. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of ellagic acid (EA) on arsenic-induced neurotoxicity in rats.


DESIGN
Animals were divided into five groups. The first group received normal saline (2 ml/kg) for 21 days as control group. Group 2 was orally treated with sodium arsenite (SA, 10 mg/kg) for 21 days. Groups 3 and 4 were orally treated with SA (10 mg/kg) for 7 days prior to EA (10 and 30 mg/kg respectively) treatment and continued up to 21 days simultaneously with SA administration. Group 5 was orally treated with EA (30 mg/kg) for 14 days. Passive avoidance test and rotarod test were done to evaluate the behavioral changes following SA and/or EA treatment. Different biochemical, histological and molecular biomarkers were assessed in the brain tissue.


RESULTS
Our data showed that SA significantly elevated brain tissue arsenic levels and malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, protein carbonylation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interlukein-1β production. A decrease in the total antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity occurred in the brain of rats exposed to SA. SA-treated rats showed a significant impairment in long-term-memory, motor coordination and equilibrium. These results were supported by histopathological observations of the brain. Results revealed that administration of EA (30 mg/kg) reversed all neural markers alternation and ameliorated behavioral and histopathological changes induced by SA.

We aimed to determine the effect of functional polymorphisms and haplotypes in the Dopamine Receptor D4 (DRD4) gene on general psychopathological symptoms in ED patients. Two-hundred-and-seventy-three ED patients [199 with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and 74 with Bulimia Nervosa (BN)] completed the SCL-90R inventory and were genotyped for four functional, clinically relevant DRD4 polymorphisms: three variants in the promoter region [120-bp tandem repeat (TR, long vs. short allele), C-616G and C-521 T] and a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in exon 3 (7R vs. non-7R allele). After correcting for multiple testing, none of the assayed polymorphisms were individually associated with SCL-90R results. Four DRD4 haplotypes (*1-*4) were detected in the patients with a frequency > 0.1. In the BN group, haplotype *2 (non7R-TR long-C-C) was associated with higher scores in the three global SCL-90R indices (GSI, PSDI and PST) after Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0.01 in all instances). Furthermore, carriers of this haplotype displayed higher scores (worst symptomatology) in Somatization, Obsessive-Compulsive, Anxiety, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation and the test additional items (p-values for the differences between carriers vs. non-carriers ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0110).

505,"The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is gaining in popularity as a procedure to investigate the lymphatic metastasis of malignant tumors. The commonly used techniques to identify the SLNs in clinical practice are blue dyes-guided visualization, radioisotope-based detection and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. However, all these methods have not been found to perfectly fit the clinical criteria with issues such as short retention time in SLN, poor spatial resolution, autofluorescence, low photostability and high cost. In this study, we have reported a new type of nanoprobes, named, gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs) for the SLN Raman imaging. With the advantageous features including unique ""fingerprint"" Raman signal, strong Raman enhancement, high photostability, good biocompatibility and extra-long retention time, we have demonstrated that GERTs are greatly favorable for high-contrast and deep SLN Raman imaging, which meanwhile reveals the dynamic migration behavior of the probes entering the SLN. In addition, a quantitative volumetric Raman imaging (qVRI) data-processing method is employed to acquire a high-resolution 3-dimensional (3D) margin of SLN as well as the content variation of GERTs in the SLN. Moreover, SLN detection could be realized via a cost-effective commercial portable Raman scanner.

506,"BACKGROUND
Few studies are focused on the quality of life (QOL) of primary caregivers and the effects of the clinical variables of epilepsy and patient psychiatric comorbidity on primary caregivers.


PURPOSE
Our main objective was to describe QOL and level of burden (LB) in caregivers of people with epilepsy (PWE) at a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico City. A secondary purpose was to determine if LB and QOL were different between caregivers of patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidity and caregivers of patients without neuropsychiatric comorbidity.


METHODS
One hundred and fifty-one caregivers of PWE were assessed with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) scale (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Zarit Burden Interview. Patients' clinical and demographic data, along with their psychiatric histories, were collected.


RESULTS
One hundred and twelve patients had psychiatric comorbidity. The mean LB score of the caregivers was 26.25±16.28. The mean scores for the WHOQOL-BREF domains were as follows: physical health, 47.8±10.7; psychological health, 55.4±11.5; social relationships, 47.23±18.6; and environment, 48.7±11.6. The caregivers of patients with psychiatric comorbidity had lower scores in the domains of psychological health (p=0.034) and social relationships (p=0.029) compared with caregivers of PWE without comorbidity. On adjusted multivariate analysis, aggressiveness (p=0.008), age at onset of epilepsy (p=0.02), and years with epilepsy (p=0.01) were associated with higher caregiver LB scores; higher caregiver years of education were associated with better psychological health (p=0.002) and more years with epilepsy (p=0.03) with lower QOL scores.


CONCLUSION
Aggressive behavior was the psychiatric comorbidity most clearly associated with lower QOL and higher LB. Longer duration of epilepsy was related to higher burden and lower QOL. More years of education of the caregiver were associated with better QOL. We found no significant correlation between seizure control and QOL or LB.",29455081,2018,Quality of life and level of burden in primary caregivers of patients with epilepsy: Effect of neuropsychiatric comorbidity.
507,"Secondary salinization represents a global threat to freshwater ecosystems. Salts, such as NaCl, can be toxic to freshwater organisms and may also modify the outcome of species interactions (e.g. host-parasite interactions). In nature, hosts and their parasites are embedded in complex communities where they face anthropogenic and biotic (i.e. predators) stressors that influence host-parasite interactions. As human populations grow, considering how anthropogenic and natural stressors interact to shape host-parasite interactions will become increasingly important. We conducted two experiments investigating: (1) the effects of NaCl on tadpole susceptibility to trematodes and (2) whether density- and trait-mediated effects of a parasite-predator (i.e. damselfly) and a host-predator (i.e. dragonfly), respectively, modify the effects of NaCl on susceptibility to trematode infection. In the first experiment, we exposed tadpoles to three concentrations of NaCl and measured parasite infection in tadpoles. In the second experiment, we conducted a 2 (tadpoles exposed to 0 g L-1 NaCl vs. 1 g L-1 NaCl) x 4 (no predator, free-ranging parasite-predator (damselfly), non-lethal host-predator (dragonfly kairomone), and free-ranging parasite-predator + dragonfly kairomone) factorial experiment. In the absence of predators, exposure to NaCl increased parasite infection. Of the predator treatments, NaCl only caused an increase in parasite infection in the presence of the parasite-predator. However, direct consumption of trematodes caused a reduction in overall infection in the parasite-predator treatment. In the dragonfly kairomone treatment, a reduction in tadpole movement (i.e. trematode avoidance behavior) led to an increase in overall infection. In the parasite-predator + dragonfly kairomone treatment, antagonistic effects of the parasite-predator (reduction in trematode abundance) and dragonfly kairomone (reduction in parasite avoidance behavior) resulted in intermediate parasite infection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NaCl can increase amphibian susceptibility to parasites, and underscores the importance of considering predator-mediated interactions in understanding how contaminants influence host-parasite interactions.",29455088,2018,Parasite susceptibility in an amphibian host is modified by salinization and predators.

509,"Highway safety laws aim to influence driver behaviors so as to reduce the frequency and severity of crashes, and their outcomes. For one specific highway safety law, it would have different effects on the crashes across severities. Understanding such effects can help policy makers upgrade current laws and hence improve traffic safety. To investigate the effects of highway safety laws on crashes across severities, multivariate models are needed to account for the interdependency issues in crash counts across severities. Based on the characteristics of the dependent variables, multivariate dynamic Tobit (MVDT) models are proposed to analyze crash counts that are aggregated at the state level. Lagged observed dependent variables are incorporated into the MVDT models to account for potential temporal correlation issues in crash data. The state highway safety law related factors are used as the explanatory variables and socio-demographic and traffic factors are used as the control variables. Three models, a MVDT model with lagged observed dependent variables, a MVDT model with unobserved random variables, and a multivariate static Tobit (MVST) model are developed and compared. The results show that among the investigated models, the MVDT models with lagged observed dependent variables have the best goodness-of-fit. The findings indicate that, compared to the MVST, the MVDT models have better explanatory power and prediction accuracy. The MVDT model with lagged observed variables can better handle the stochasticity and dependency in the temporal evolution of the crash counts and the estimated values from the model are closer to the observed values. The results show that more lives could be saved if law enforcement agencies can make a sustained effort to educate the public about the importance of motorcyclists wearing helmets. Motor vehicle crash-related deaths, injuries, and property damages could be reduced if states enact laws for stricter text messaging rules, higher speeding fines, older licensing age, and stronger graduated licensing provisions.

METHODS
In total, 200 prison inmates were included in this questionnaire-based study. Data on demographic characteristics, adverse family experiences during childhood and psychiatric backgrounds were collected via face-to-face interviews, and a psychometric evaluation was conducted using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28) and Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES).


RESULTS
Several historical items were more common in females than in males including family history of psychiatric disease (23.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.048), a personal history of psychiatric disease (51.0% vs. 29.0%, p < 0.001), and previous suicide attempts (49.0% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001). In male inmates, in contrast, there were higher rates of substance abuse (48.0% vs. 29.0%, p < 0.001) and previous convictions (50.0% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001). Males had a younger age at first crime (24.9 ± 8.9 years vs. 30.3 ± 9.2 years, p < 0.001), whereas females had higher rates of violent crimes (69.2% vs. 30.8% p < 0.001) and higher CTQ total scores (51.9 ± 20.9 vs. 46.2 ± 18.9, p = 0.04). A significant relationship of CTQ total score was noted with age at first offense (β = 0.772, p < 0.001) but not with sentence length (β = 0.075, p = 0.292). There were also possible mediating roles of psychiatric problems, adverse family experiences and DES in the relationship between CTQ and age at first offense.


CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our findings revealed a high prevalence of and significant associations among childhood trauma, dissociative experiences, adverse family experiences and psychiatric problems in a cohort of incarcerated females and males. A psychiatric background, childhood trauma characterized by sexual abuse and violent crimes were found to be predominant in female prison inmates, whereas a criminal background with a younger age at first offense and frequent previous convictions, substance use and sexual crimes were more prevalent among male prison inmates.

512,"INTRODUCTION
It is projected that 17 730 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia in 2017, with 3114 of these predicted to be fatal. Caregiving for a person with cancer can significantly impact caregivers' physical and mental health. Many caregivers feel ill-prepared for this role, especially when care involves complex medical needs accompanied by the psychological challenges experienced following a cancer diagnosis.


METHODS AND ANALYSIS
This study employs a convergent, parallel, mixed methods design combining an online survey with an optional interview. Eligible, consenting participants will be invited to participate in a survey to examine (1) participants' unmet needs, (2) challenges experienced throughout the cancer journey, (3) perceived self-efficacy to determine participants' level of confidence in undertaking caregiver tasks, (4) views regarding suitable content to include in a caregiver training intervention, (5) preferred method of intervention delivery (ie, website, smartphone application and/or interactive video), and (6) preferences for the timing of delivery of the intervention content (ie, ability to choose a module, access to the entire content or have a set order in which they receive the information). Caregivers will be eligible to participate if they (1) are male, (2) have previously cared for or are currently caring for a woman with breast cancer, (3) are aged over 18 years, and (4) do not currently suffer from a cognitive impairment or mental health condition (ie, depression, anxiety). Data analysis will include examination of differences in psychological outcomes and needs based on demographic variables, and mediation analysis to explore whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between challenges, unmet needs and distress. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis.

To review the patients operated by endoscopic transphenoidal approach for skull base lesions. All the clinical data including age, gender, type of pathology, surgical outcome and surgical complications were studied.


METHODS
A clinical prospective study was conducted on 94 cases with skull base lesion that were treated in Neuroscience Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq between October 2011 and December 2016. We followed each patient for an average of 2 years after surgery to determine most common lesion involving the skull base, age and gender distribution, surgical outcome, complications and hospital accommodation. Freeze system of Storz all the cases in the study.


RESULTS
The majority of our patients were between the ages of 20-29 years. Among the 94 patients, 67% had macro adenomas, followed by craniopharyngioma 11%. The mortality rate was 2.1%, Gross total removal was 57.4%. All patients show improvement of the headache after surgery, visual improvement was noticed in 73.4% and hospital accommodation was 2-5 days. Three patients developed cerebrospinal fluid leak, Infection meningitis developed in 3 patients 3.1%, and 2 patients (2.1%) suffered from hormonal disorders and were referred to endocrinologist for therapy. Diabetes insipidus developed as a temporary complication in 4 cases (4.2%).

515,"Bacillus vallismortis (B. vallismortis), an aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, was screened in a laboratory pilot study, to assess the interaction between the heavy metal Zn(II) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The influence of Zn(II) stress on EPS production, component variation, and sorption performance, was investigated. The characteristics of B. vallismortis EPS formed under stress were analyzed using FTIR, 3D-EEM and XPS. EPS was used as an adsorbent and the adsorption capacity and adsorption behavior of EPS formed with and without Zn(II) stress, were compared and assessed. Results showed that the production of polysaccharides and proteins, the main components of EPS, were promoted under Zn(II) stress. The types of EPS functional groups observed remained the same with and without heavy metal stress, but their concentrations were increased. Due to stress-induction, the adsorption capacity of Zn-EPS was significantly enhanced compared with the control-EPS. Specific EPS produced by B. vallismortis in the presence of Zn(II) stress, could have a wide range of potential applications, allowing optimization and improvement of the capacity of EPS to remove heavy metals from effluent.",29455259,2018,Influence of Zn(II) stress-induction on component variation and sorption performance of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from Bacillus vallismortis.
516,"Grit and ambition are psychological factors that may protect neurocognitive function among persons living with HIV (PLWH). We examined associations between grit, ambition, premorbid verbal intellectual function, and current neurocognitive and everyday functioning among PLWH and persons without HIV (HIV-). 120 PLWH and 94 HIV- adults completed the Grit Scale (includes total score and consistency of interests and perseverance of effort subscales), ambition scale, and a comprehensive neurobehavioral battery. PLWH had lower grit scores than HIV- adults. The two groups did not differ on ambition. No relationship was observed between grit and cognition among HIV- adults. Among PLWH, however, higher perseverance of effort and more ambition was related to better global neurocognitive functioning, and higher grit, but not ambition, was related to independence in daily functioning. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate these relationships over time and examine whether grit or ambition have protective effects on cognitive outcomes among PLWH.",29455265,2018,Grit and Ambition are Associated with Better Neurocognitive and Everyday Functioning Among Adults Living with HIV.
517,"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are specialized receptors that represent a key component of the host innate immune system. Whether molecular evolutionary history of different PRR classes have involved different genetic mechanisms underlying diverse pathogen environment in mammals, and whether distinct ecology of mammals may have imposed divergent selective pressures on the evolution of the PRRs, remained unknown. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the characterization of 20 genes belonging to four PRR classes in mammals. Evidence of positive selection was found in most (17 of 20) PRR genes examined, and most positively selected sites (84%) undergoing radical changes were found to fall in important functional regions, consistent with the co-evolutionary dynamics between the hosts and their microbial counterparts. We found different evolutionary patterns in different PRR classes, with the highest level of positive selection in C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family, suggesting that the capability of CLRs in response to a wide variety of ligands might explain their malleability to selection pressures. Tests using branch models that partitioned the data along habitat and social behavior found significant evidence of divergent selective pressures of PRRs among mammalian groups. Interestingly, species-specific evolution was detected on RIG-I-like helicase genes (RLRs) in cetaceans, suggesting that RLRs might play a critical role in the defense against widespread marine RNA viruses during their divergence and radiation into marine habitats. This study provides a comprehensive look at the evolutionary patterns and implications of mammalian PRRs, and highlights the importance of ecological influences in molecular adaptation.",29455279,2018,Divergent Selection of Pattern Recognition Receptors in Mammals with Different Ecological Characteristics.
518,"In this investigation, we attempt to replicate the Interdisciplinary Financial Planning Model advanced by Hershey et al. (International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 70, 1-38, 2010) using a sample of Brazilian adults. This model, which was originally tested on individuals from The Netherlands and the United States, posits that psychological, social, and economic forces are key determinants of retirement planning practices and perceptions of saving adequacy. Taken together, fifteen hypotheses were subject to evaluation. Participants were 167 Brazilian working adults, 21-69 years of age, who were married or cohabitating at the time of testing. A path analysis model showed substantial support for the theoretical framework, with all variables found to contribute directly or indirectly to the prediction of financial planning and saving adequacy. Furthermore, two new paths were found to emerge in the Brazilian model that were not observed in the original investigation. This cross-national replication of the Interdisciplinary Financial Planning Model extends research on the topic to a developing country in which relatively few empirical studies of retirement planning have been carried out. Other analyses in the article focus on direct comparisons between the Brazilian model and the models developed based on American and Dutch respondents, with an eye toward better understanding how cultural forces shape the retirement planning process. The discussion focuses on how models of financial planning, such as the Hershey et al.

519,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, and its mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) present in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, Val158Met (rs4680) (Chr22: 19,963,498), is possibly related to the violent behavior of schizophrenia patients. However, the specific variant that causes violent behavior is still unknown. Since the Val variation of Val158Met (rs4680) introduces a CG site into the sequence, the methylation level of the Val158Met (rs4680) region may also have an association with the homicidal behavior of schizophrenia patients. A case-control study was conducted that included 100 normal males, 100 schizophrenia inpatients, and 100 schizophrenia inpatients with homicidal behavior. A polymorphism of Val158Met (rs4680) and the methylation levels were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Compared to Met carriers, the Val/Val genotype was significantly associated with the homicidal behavior of schizophrenia patients. In addition, the methylation levels of the Val158Met (rs4680) region were significantly different between the three groups. Moreover, the methylation level of an rs4680-related CpG site was significantly associated with the Val/Val genotype which may contribute to the homicidal behavior of schizophrenia patients. In this study, we showed that the Val allele at Val158Met (rs4680) may be associated with the homicidal behavior of schizophrenia patients as well as that the methylation level of Val158Met (rs4680) could be affected by the variation of Val158Met (rs4680) and eventually contribute to the violent behavior of schizophrenia patients.",29455339,2018,Analysis of COMT Val158Met polymorphisms and methylation in Chinese male schizophrenia patients with homicidal behavior.
520,"In the present study, long-term environmental impacts of compact and ground cement composites, in which 30 wt.% of cement was replaced by washed municipal solid wastes incineration (MSWI) fly ash, were investigated for use in building industry. Consecutive leaching tests over a time span of 180 days were performed in acid water, deionized water, and saline water, respectively, with the accumulative concentration of different elements determined in the leachate. Different leaching behaviors are observed among different potential toxic elements (PTEs). For instance, higher concentrations of V in the leachate were observed from the compact cement composites than those from the ground ones. The concentration of Ba in the leachate increased with the decrease of particle size of the cement composites, and an initial increase in the leaching efficiency of Sn was followed by a clear decline with the leaching time. In addition, kinetic study revealed that the leaching behaviors of potential toxic elements follow a second-order model. The results demonstrated that the addition of washed MSWI fly ash into cement can contribute to the attrition resistance, indicating that the washed MSWI fly ash could be a promising alternative for cement as supplementary building materials.",29455349,2018,Application of washed MSWI fly ash in cement composites: long-term environmental impacts.
521,"In situ carmustine wafers containing 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) are commonly used for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma to overcome the brain-blood barrier. In theory, this chemotherapy diffuses into the adjacent parenchyma and the excipient degrades in maximum 8 weeks but no clinical data confirms this evolution, because patients are rarely operated again. A 75-year-old patient was operated twice for recurrent glioblastoma, and a carmustine wafer was implanted during the second surgery. Eleven months later, a third surgery was performed, revealing unexpected incomplete degradation of the wafer. 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance was performed to compare this wafer to pure BCNU and to an unused copolymer wafer. In the used wafer, peaks corresponding to hydrophobic units of the excipient were no longer noticeable, whereas peaks of the hydrophilic units and traces of BCNU were still present. These surprising results could be related to the formation of a hydrophobic membrane around the wafer, thus interfering with the expected diffusion and degradation processes. The clinical benefit of carmustine wafers in addition to the standard radio-chemotherapy remains limited, and in vivo behavior of this treatment is not completely elucidated yet. We found that the wafer may remain after several months. Alternative strategies to deal with the blood-brain barrier, such as drug-loaded liposomes or ultrasound-opening, must be explored to offer larger drug diffusion or allow repetitive delivery.",29455370,2018,Incomplete copolymer degradation of in situ chemotherapy.
522,"Introduction An important yet understudied component of postpartum type 2 diabetes risk reduction among high risk women is experiences with the healthcare system. Our objective was to describe the healthcare experiences of a diverse, low-income sample of women with prior GDM, including their suggestions for improving care. Methods Focus groups were conducted among African American, Hispanic, and Appalachian women who were diagnosed with GDM within the past 10 years. Participants were recruited from community and medical resources. Twelve focus groups were conducted, four within each race-ethnic group. Results Three broad themes were identified around barriers to GDM care, management, and follow-up: (1) communication issues; (2) personal and environmental barriers; and (3) type and quality of healthcare. Many women felt communication with their provider could be improved, including more education on the severity of GDM, streamlining information to be less overwhelming, and providing additional support through referrals to community resources. Although women expressed interest in receiving more actionable advice for managing GDM during pregnancy and for preventing type 2 diabetes postpartum, few women reported changing behaviors. Barriers to behavior change were related to cost, transportation, and competing demands. Several opportunities for improved care were elucidated. Discussion Our findings suggest that across all racial and ethnic representations in our sample, low-income women with GDM experience similar communication, personal, and environmental barriers related to the healthcare they receive for their GDM. Considering the increased exposure to the health care system during a GDM-affected pregnancy, there are opportunities to address barriers among women with GDM across different race-ethnic groups.",29455383,2018,Healthcare Experiences of Low-Income Women with Prior Gestational Diabetes.
523,"Background High stress and depression during pregnancy are risk factors for worsened health trajectories for both mother and offspring. This is also true for pre-pregnancy obesity and excessive gestational weight gain. Reducing stress and depression may be one path to prevent excessive caloric intake and gestational weight gain. Study Purpose We tested the feasibility of two novel interventions aimed at reducing stress and overeating during pregnancy. Reflecting different theoretical underpinnings, the interventions target different mechanisms. Mindful Moms Training (MMT) uses mindfulness to improve awareness and acceptance of experiences and promote conscious rather than automatic behavior choices. Emotional Brain Training (EBT) uses active coping to change perceptions of negative experience and promote positive affective states. Methods Forty-six overweight/obese low-income women were assigned to either MMT (n = 24) or EBT (n = 22) for an 8-week feasibility study. Pre-post changes in perceived stress, eating and presumed mechanisms were assessed. Results Women reported high levels of stress at baseline. Both interventions were well attended and demonstrated clinically significant pre-post reductions in stress, depressive symptoms, and improved eating behaviors. MMT significantly decreased experiential avoidance, whereas EBT significantly increased positive reappraisal; these changes were marginally significantly different by group. Conclusions This feasibility study found that both interventions promoted meaningful reductions in stress and depressive symptoms and improved reported eating behaviors in a high-risk group of pregnant women. Each intervention has a potentially different pathway-acceptance for MMT and reappraisal for EBT. Larger studies are needed to test efficacy on longer term reductions in stress and overeating.",29455384,2018,Novel Interventions to Reduce Stress and Overeating in Overweight Pregnant Women: A Feasibility Study.
524,"We previously reported that Yulangsan polysaccharide (YLSP), which was isolated from the root of Millettia pulchra Kurz, attenuates withdrawal symptoms of morphine dependence by regulating the nitric oxide pathway and modulating monoaminergic neurotransmitters. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanism of YLSP on the reinstatement of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. A CPP procedure was employed to assess the behavior of rats, and indicators of serum and four brain regions (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) were determined to explore its underlying mechanism. YLSP inhibited priming morphine-induced reinstatement of CPP in a dose-dependent manner. YLSP markedly reduced nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase levels in the brain. Moreover, YLSP significantly decreased the dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the serum and brain. Furthermore, YLSP significantly decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations, inhibited the expression of dopamine D1 receptors and cAMP response element binding protein mRNA, and improved the expression of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in the four brain regions. Our findings indicated that YLSP could inhibit the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP possibly by modulating the NO-cGMP and D1R-cAMP signaling pathways.",29455417,2018,Effect of Yulangsan Polysaccharide on the Reinstatement of Morphine-Induced Conditioned Place Preference in Sprague-Dawley Rats.
525,"Pathological gambling is characterized by a persisting maladaptive and recurrent behavior with severe social and psychological consequences. There is evidence of strong comorbidity with psychiatric manifestations as well as cognitive mainly involving executive functions. This study aimed to investigate impairment in executive functions and working memory, and personality traits in a sample of Greek gamblers. Twenty-four men involved in various gambling activities were recruited from ecological settings as probable pathological gamblers. They were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery involving several executive tasks, the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. An age- and education-level matched group of 21 men without history of habitual gambling served as controls. As a group, gamblers displayed significantly lower scores on indices of inhibition, decision making and self-reported emotional awareness, and scored higher on impulsivity/sensation seeking personality traits. Notably, gamblers scored similarly or significantly higher on measures of verbal and visuospatial working memory, cognitive flexibility, processing speed, verbal fluency, and sustained attention. Overall, we argue that gamblers do present with specific cognitive deficits, but there is no evidence for a generalized executive impairment, and further stress the importance of investigating cognitive, personality, and psychiatric aspects of gambling on the basis of an ecologically valid sampling.",29455442,2018,In Search of Executive Impairment in Pathological Gambling: A Neuropsychological Study on Non-treatment Seeking Gamblers.
526,"Gambling Disorder (GD) is a complex psychopathology involving a numbers of cognitive, behavioral, emotional and neurobiological determinants. Previous research suggests that GD may frequently co-occur with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. However, there is still a lack of study investigating Pathological Narcissism (PN) in both its vulnerable and grandiose facets among clinical population. Moreover, emotional dysregulation is commonly thought to underlie GD albeit research on this topic remains poor. The present study aims to investigate the role of both vulnerable and grandiose narcissism in relation to GD as well as the mediator role played by emotion dysregulation in such link. We administered to a sample of addicted gamblers (n = 74) and a sample of heathy controls (n = 105), the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Differences across groups emerged on the scores obtained on the PNI and DERS. Moreover, we found positive associations between SOGS scores and both PNI and DERS. Also, strategic addicted gamblers showed higher levels of vulnerable narcissism compared to others. Finally, emotion dysregulation difficulties appeared to fully mediate the relationship between grandiose narcissism and GD severity. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism appear important variables involved in GD. Also, emotion regulation deficits seem to account for GD and to explain the pathways by which grandiose narcissism leads to GD. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.",29455443,2018,Narcissistic Implications in Gambling Disorder: The Mediating Role of Emotion Dysregulation.

528,"Information on genetic relationships among individuals is essential to many studies of the behavior and ecology of wild organisms. Parentage and relatedness assays based on large numbers of SNP loci hold substantial advantages over the microsatellite markers traditionally used for these purposes. We present a double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) analysis pipeline that, as such, simultaneously achieves the SNP discovery and genotyping steps and which is optimized to return a statistically powerful set of SNP markers (typically 150-600 after stringent filtering) from large numbers of individuals (up to 240 per run). We explore the tradeoffs inherent in this approach through a set of experiments in a species with a complex social system, the variegated fairy-wren (Malurus lamberti), and further validate it in a phylogenetically broad set of other bird species. Through direct comparisons with a parallel dataset from a robust panel of highly variable microsatellite markers, we show that this ddRAD-seq approach results in substantially improved power to discriminate among potential relatives and considerably more precise estimates of relatedness coefficients. The pipeline is designed to be universally applicable to all bird species (and with minor modifications to many other taxa), to be cost- and time-efficient, and to be replicable across independent runs such that genotype data from different study periods can be combined and analyzed as field samples are accumulated.

529,"Youth living with HIV (YLH) have significant problems with attending their medical appointments. Poor attendance, consequently, predicts viral non-suppression and other negative health outcomes. To identity targets of intervention, this cross-sectional study examined correlates of past-year missed clinic visits among YLH (N = 2125) attending HIV clinics in the United States and Puerto Rico. Thirty-six percent of YLH missed two or more visits in the past year. Several factors were associated with missed visits in our regression model. Among sociodemographic characteristics and HIV disclosure status, females (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, compared to males), Black YLH or YLH of mixed racial heritage (AORs = 1.76, 1.71, respectively, compared to White YLH), YLH with an unknown route of infection (AOR = 1.86, compared to YLH with perinatal infection), and YLH endorsing HIV disclosure (AOR = 1.37, compared to YLH not endorsing disclosure) were at greater risk for missed visits. Among behavioral health risks, YLH who endorsed marijuana use (AOR = 1.42), frequent other drug use (AOR = 1.60), or a history of incarceration (AOR = 1.27) had greater odds of missed visits than youth not endorsing these risks. Finally, two social-cognitive resources emerged as protective factors: adherence self-efficacy (AOR = .28) and social support (AOR = .88). We discuss how providers working with YLH can improve this population's retention outcomes.",29455553,2018,Correlates of missed clinic visits among youth living with HIV.

531,"BACKGROUND
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is common in clozapine-treated patients although the actual prevalence, phenomenology and risk factors remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to address the three aforementioned questions.


METHODS
The electronic records of a large cohort of clozapine-medicated schizophrenia patients routinely screened for OCD were used. The Obsessive Compulsive Inventory Revised version (OCI-R) was available from 118 cases and a 21 points cut-off threshold for OCD was defined.


RESULTS
OCD prevalence was 47%, higher in patients on poly-pharmacy than on monotherapy (64% vs 31%; p = 0.001). Two OCI-R factors had significantly higher scores and distinct risk factors: checking behaviour (mean = 5.1; SD = 3.6) correlated with length of clozapine treatment (r = 0.21; p = 0.026), and obsessing factor (mean = 4.8; SD = 3.6) correlated with psychosis severity (r = 0.59; p = 0.001). These factors along with total OCI-R, did not correlate with either clozapine dose or plasma levels, after correcting for psychosis severity.


CONCLUSIONS
Screening for OCD in clozapine patients, and probably in those treated with structurally similar drugs with potent antiserotoninergic properties, should be widely adopted by clinicians.

532,"BACKGROUND
Habits are behavioral routines that are automatic and frequent, relatively independent of any desired outcome, and have potent antecedent cues. Among individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), behaviors that promote the starved state appear habitual, and this is the foundation of a recent neurobiological model of AN. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the habit model of AN by examining the impact of an intervention focused on antecedent cues for eating disorder routines.


METHODS
The primary intervention target was habit strength; we also measured clinical impact via eating disorder psychopathology and actual eating. Twenty-two hospitalized patients with AN were randomly assigned to 12 sessions of either Supportive Psychotherapy or a behavioral intervention aimed at cues for maladaptive behavioral routines, Regulating Emotions and Changing Habits (REaCH).


RESULTS
Covarying for baseline, REaCH was associated with a significantly lower Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) score and significantly lower Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) global score at the end-of-treatment. The end-of-treatment effect size for SRHI was d = 1.28, for EDE-Q was d = 0.81, and for caloric intake was d = 1.16.


CONCLUSIONS
REaCH changed habit strength of maladaptive routines more than an active control therapy, and targeting habit strength yielded improvement in clinically meaningful measures. These findings support a habit-based model of AN, and suggest habit strength as a mechanism-based target for intervention.",29455696,2018,Targeting habits in anorexia nervosa: a proof-of-concept randomized trial.
533,"This report identifies what is known about audience motivations at three different mass-gathering events: outdoor music festivals, religious events, and sporting events. In light of these motivations, the paper discusses how these can be harnessed by the event organizer and Emergency Medical Services. Lastly, motivations tell what kinds of interventions can be used to achieve an understanding of audience characteristics and the opportunity to develop tailor-made programs to maximize safety and make long-lasting public health interventions to a particular ""cohort"" or event population. A lot of these will depend on what the risks/hazards are with the particular populations in order to ""target"" them with public health interventions. Audience motivations tell the event organizer and Emergency Medical Services about the types of behaviors they should expect from the audience and how this may affect their health while at the event. Through these understandings, health promotion and event safety messages can be developed for a particular type of mass-gathering event based on the likely composition of the audience in attendance. Health promotion and providing public information should be at the core of any mass-gathering event to minimize public health risk and to provide opportunities for the promotion of healthy behaviors in the local population. Audience motivations are a key element to identify and agree on what public health information is needed for the event audience. A more developed understanding of audience behavior provides critical information for event planners, event risk managers, and Emergency Medical Services personnel to better predict and plan to minimize risk and reduce patient presentations at events. Mass-gathering event organizers and designers intend their events to be positive experiences and to have meaning for those who attend. Therefore, continual vigilance to improve public health effectiveness and efficiency can become best practice at events. Through understanding the motivations of the audience, event planners and designers, event risk managers, and emergency medical personnel may be better able to understand the motivation of the audience and how this might impact on audience behavior at the event.

534,"PURPOSE
Little is known about how and when coping trajectories differ between males and females. The current study aimed to examine gender differences in the use of specific coping strategies across developmental ages using time-varying effect modeling (TVEM) in a large, diverse community sample.


METHODS
A longitudinal study following adolescents across 4 years of high school and 5 years post graduation (N = 1,251) was combined with a nationally representative cross-sectional study of 18- to 22-year-olds (N = 595) to examine changes in gender differences in the use of coping strategies between ages 13 and 25. The same coping questionnaire was administered to both samples. TVEM was used to examine the age-varying prevalence rates of coping in males and females.


RESULTS
Gender differences were greatest during middle-to-late adolescence (15-19 years) for active coping, social support seeking, planning, and venting emotions. Females reported greater use of these strategies than males, but males' use increased over time and became equivalent to females after the age of ~19-20. Gender differences in the use of humor did not emerge until the age of 22, at which point the use of humor increased continuously among males but remained stable among females. The use of denial was fairly stable across time, with no gender differences at any age.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings highlight the utility of TVEM for advancing our knowledge on gender and coping across developmental time, as males and females used coping strategies at differing rates throughout adolescence and emerging adulthood. Implications for tailoring gender- and age-specific intervention efforts to improve coping and related health behaviors are discussed.",29455714,2018,Using Time-Varying Effect Modeling to Examine Age-Varying Gender Differences in Coping Throughout Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood.
535,"PURPOSE
To assess how social fraternity involvement (i.e., membership and residence) in college relates to substance use behaviors and substance use disorder symptoms during young adulthood and early midlife in a national sample.


METHODS
National multi-cohort probability samples of US high school seniors from the Monitoring the Future study were assessed at baseline (age 18) and followed longitudinally via self-administered surveys across seven follow-up waves to age 35. The longitudinal sample consisted of 7,019 males and 8,661 females, of which 10% of males and 10% of females were active members of fraternities or sororities during college.


RESULTS
Male fraternity members who lived in fraternity houses during college had the highest levels of binge drinking and marijuana use relative to non-members and non-students in young adulthood that continued through age 35, controlling for adolescent sociodemographic and other characteristics. At age 35, 45% of the residential fraternity members reported alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms reflecting mild to severe AUDs; their adjusted odds of experiencing AUD symptoms at age 35 were higher than all other college and noncollege groups except non-residential fraternity members. Residential sorority members had higher odds of AUD symptoms at age 35 when compared with their noncollege female peers.


CONCLUSIONS
National longitudinal data confirm binge drinking and marijuana use are most prevalent among male fraternity residents relative to non-members and non-students. The increased risk of substance-related consequences associated with fraternity involvement was not developmentally limited to college and is associated with higher levels of long-term AUD symptoms during early midlife.",29455716,2018,How Collegiate Fraternity and Sorority Involvement Relates to Substance Use During Young Adulthood and Substance Use Disorders in Early Midlife: A National Longitudinal Study.
536,"PURPOSE
Sexual violence (SV) perpetration on college campuses is a serious and prevalent public health issue in the U.S. In response, incoming male freshmen are mandated to receive SV prevention programming. To provide a more effective response, however, we need to understand the SV behaviors of male freshmen before they arrive on campus and the associated factors that contribute to risk and that afford protection, areas that have received limited attention.


METHODS
Male freshmen (N = 1,133) across 30 selected 4-year colleges and universities throughout the state of Georgia were recruited for a longitudinal study on SV perpetration. Levels of precollege SV as well as a range of covariates were assessed at baseline. Self-reported SV perpetrators were compared with nonperpetrators on demographic and hypothesized covariates deemed either risk or protective; then risk and protective models were analyzed using binary logistic regression.


RESULTS
Weighted analyses revealed that 19.3% self-reported perpetrating SV before college. Before starting college, young men who reported more sexual media consumption, heavy episodic drinking, hypermasculine beliefs, and peers who endorsed SV were more likely to have a history of SV perpetration at college matriculation. Alternatively, men with more knowledge of effective sexual consent and stronger family functioning were less likely to arrive to college with an SV perpetration history.


CONCLUSIONS
A significant proportion of incoming male freshmen have perpetrated SV previously. Colleges and universities need to assess incoming freshmen for risk behaviors and negative beliefs and to offer both primary and secondary preventions to more effectively reduce further perpetration.",29455718,2018,Precollege Sexual Violence Perpetration and Associated Risk and Protective Factors Among Male College Freshmen in Georgia.
537,"OBJECTIVES
Middle adolescent males are a difficult group to recruit for community sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention research. We describe a process of community engagement, and venue-based sampling of 14-17-year-old adolescent males, and compare rates of STIs and STI risk behaviors by venue.


METHODS
Community engagement consisted of (1) informational meetings with organizations; (2) participation in community meetings and events; (3) hiring community members as study personnel; and (4) an adolescent advisory board recruited from the community. Venues were identified and assessed at different times of the day and days of the week using a structured tool. At selected venues, males ages 14-17 years were invited to participate in a brief survey and provide a urine sample and an optional anal swab for DNA-based STI testing.


RESULTS
Venues were assessed (n = 249), and 31 were selected for recruitment, including parks, apartment complexes, community events, entertainment venues, a community school, and community programs for LGBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender) and adjudicated youth. We enrolled 667 participants, average age 15.7 years. Participants reported high rates of sexual and STI risk behaviors, but had low rates of STIs. These rates differed by venue, with more structured venues recruiting youth reporting fewer STI risk behaviors and less structured venues within the highest STI prevalence zip code recruiting youth reporting more STI risk behaviors.


CONCLUSION
Venue-based sampling is a feasible mechanism to target recruitment and enrollment adolescent males with high STI risk behaviors in community settings, with risk profiles varying by setting.",29455719,2018,Community Engagement and Venue-Based Sampling in Adolescent Male Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention Research.
538,"PURPOSE
Despite recent declines, teen unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in the United States remain at levels higher than comparable nations. Initiatives to prevent teen pregnancy have focused primarily on female adolescents; how to effectively engage young men to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy has not been well studied. We proposed to adapt an innovative computer-assisted motivational interviewing (CAMI) intervention, originally designed and tested with young women, for use with young men, aged 15-24 years, to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy. This manuscript describes the design of a CAMI intervention for young men aimed at preventing teen pregnancy and improving fitness.


METHODS
This randomized controlled trial will recruit 945 sexually active young men between the ages of 15 and 24 years from three health centers in New York City. Participants will be assigned by permuted block randomization to two study arms: one aimed at reducing involvement in unintended teen pregnancy (CAMI-teen pregnancy prevention) and the other at improving overall fitness (CAMI-Fitness). Except for topic, both intervention arms will provide four sessions of Motivational Interviewing coaching and use a mobile app to track behavior and set goals. We will assess young men's sexual and reproductive health behaviors and fitness at baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 64 weeks using a mobile device app created for the study.


RESULTS
Pending ongoing study.

Results from the study are expected to enhance our understanding of the efficacy of CAMI to enhance young men's reproductive health and fitness behaviors.",29455722,2018,Computer-Assisted Motivational Interviewing Intervention to Facilitate Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Fitness Behavior Changes: A Randomized Trial for Young Men.
539,"People with more education tend to have relatively healthy lifestyles. Among other things, they smoke less than those with less education. This link between education and smoking (known as the ""educational gradient"") is frequently interpreted as causal: many researchers argue that education develops skills, habits, and preferences that discourage smoking and other unhealthy behaviors. However, an alternative possibility is that these skills, habits, and preferences develop early in life and determine the likelihood of both attaining a high level of education and avoiding smoking. I test the latter possibility using data from the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). In particular, I assess the degree to which indicators of self-control in adolescence explain the association between educational attainment and smoking in adulthood. Results from a series of regression-based tests indicate that self-control is a significant predictor of both outcomes, even when controlling for a host of other risk factors. However, it does not appear to explain the educational gradient.",29455746,2018,"Today's decisions, Tomorrow's outcomes: Does self-control explain the educational smoking gradient?"
540,"The traditional approach to class voting has largely ignored the question whether material class positions coincide with subjective class identification. Following Sosnaud et al. (2013), this study evaluates party preferences when Europeans' material and subjective social class do not coincide. Seminal studies on voting behavior have suggested that members of lower classes are more likely to vote for the economic left and cultural right and that higher classes demonstrate the opposite pattern. Yet, these studies have on the one hand overlooked the possibility that there is a mismatch between the material class people can be classified in and the class they think they are part of, and on the other hand the consequences of this discordant class identification on voting behavior. Analyzing the 2009 wave of the European Elections Study, we find that the majority of the Europeans discordantly identify with the middle class, whereas only a minority of the lower and higher classes concordantly identify with their material social class. Further, material class only seems to predict economic voting behavior when it coincides with subjective class; for instance, individuals who have an inflated class identification are more likely to vote for the economic left, even when they materially can be classified as middle or high class. We conclude this paper with a discussion on scholarly debates concerning class and politics.",29455752,2018,"Imagining class: A study into material social class position, subjective identification, and voting behavior across Europe."
541,"During the global housing boom that preceded the 2007-9 financial crisis, household debt increased substantially in many European countries, posing a challenge for literature on financialization and the institutional heterogeneity of mortgage markets. This paper examines recent institutional shifts in European mortgage markets and specifies three analytically distinct models of debt accumulation: inclusion, extension and intensity. While existing research has emphasized inclusion (access to homeownership), we show that financial intensification is an important determinant of cross-national variation in debt. We assess the variation in financial intensity in six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) using household-level survey data. Our results show that inclusion and expansion explain only part of the cross-national variation in mortgage debt to income ratios. Furthermore, household financial behavior is consistent with the financial intensity model, and variation in the degree of financial intensification explains a substantial portion of the cross-national difference in debt levels.",29455753,2018,Varieties of indebtedness: Financialization and mortgage market institutions in Europe.
542,"INTRODUCTION
Clinical trials have demonstrated significant impact in reducing weight and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the intensity of these trials limits their scalability to real world settings. The purpose of this study was to embed a lifestyle intervention for overweight and obese mothers within the routine practice of a parent education, home visiting organization.


DESIGN
Pragmatic trial that used a stratified random design.


SETTING/PARTICIPANTS
Overweight or obese mothers of preschool children located across St. Louis, Missouri, enrolled in Parents As Teachers, a home visiting organization reaching women and children nationwide.


INTERVENTION
A lifestyle intervention derived from the Diabetes Prevention Program was embedded within Parents As Teachers entitled Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home (HEALTH).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Outcomes included the proportion of women that achieved 5% weight loss at 24 months and improvements in clinical and behavioral outcomes at 12 and 24 months. Participants were enrolled from 2012 to 2014 and data analysis began in 2016.


RESULTS
Women in the usual care versus intervention group were significantly less likely to achieve 5% weight loss at 24 months (11% vs 26%, p=0.01). At 12 months, there was a 2.8-kg difference in weight between groups (p=0.0006), and by 24 months a 4.7-kg difference in weight (3.2 [SD=7.6] kg vs -1.5 [SD=8.3] kg, p=0.002); group differences in waist circumference were also evident by 12 months (2.1 [SD=8.4] cm vs -0.7 [SD=9.8] cm, p=0.04) and 24 months (3.8 [SD=10.6] cm vs -2.5 [SD=9.1] cm, p=0.005), as were improvements in behavioral outcomes. There was no difference in blood pressure between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
HEALTH achieved modest but clinically significant weight loss outcomes, and reduced weight gain in mothers of young children. The scalability of this embedded intervention offers the potential to reach mothers in Parents As Teachers programs nationally.

Today, novel high-throughput technologies are providing researches with increasingly complex information on the diverse phenotypic signatures of individual lymphocytes. With a focus on T cells, we summarize here, how computational approaches are becoming increasingly important to identify the relevant developmental boundaries and connections between these high-dimensional lymphocyte states. We then describe how these insights may be further expanded by novel experimental approaches that allow to map the fate of individual T cells and their progeny in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we highlight how these experiments have uncovered a probabilistic regulatory structure of T cell immune responses and briefly discuss, how two distinct theoretical frameworks used to describe this structure may be merged to best capture single T cell behavior in computational terms.",29455845,2018,Single-Cell Resolution of T Cell Immune Responses.

Our ability to seek out social partners, flexibly navigate and learn from social interactions, and develop social relationships is critically important for our social and cognitive development and for our mental and physical health. Despite the importance of our social interactions, the neurodevelopmental bases of such interactions are underexplored, as most research examines social processing in noninteractive contexts. We begin this chapter with evidence from behavioral work and adult neuroimaging studies demonstrating how social-interactive context fundamentally alters cognitive and neural processing. We then highlight four brain networks that play key roles in social interaction and, drawing on existing developmental neuroscience literature, posit the functional roles these networks may play in social-interactive development. We conclude by discussing how a social-interactive neuroscience approach holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both typical and atypical social development.",29455860,2018,A Social-Interactive Neuroscience Approach to Understanding the Developing Brain.
545,"Susceptibility to social influence is associated with a host of negative outcomes during adolescence. However, emerging evidence implicates the role of peers and parents in adolescents' positive and adaptive adjustment. Hence, in this chapter we highlight social influence as an opportunity for promoting social adjustment, which can redirect negative trajectories and help adolescents thrive. We discuss influential models about the processes underlying social influence, with a particular emphasis on internalizing social norms, embedded in social learning and social identity theory. We link this behavioral work to developmental social neuroscience research, rooted in neurobiological models of decision making and social cognition. Work from this perspective suggests that the adolescent brain is highly malleable and particularly oriented toward the social world, which may account for heightened susceptibility to social influences during this developmental period. This chapter underscores the need to leverage social influences during adolescence, even beyond the family and peer context, to promote positive developmental outcomes. By further probing the underlying neural mechanisms as an additional layer to examining social influence on positive youth development, we will be able to gain traction on our understanding of this complex phenomenon.",29455864,2018,Social Influence on Positive Youth Development: A Developmental Neuroscience Perspective.
546,"This chapter discusses what cognition-action trade-offs in infancy reveal about the organization and developmental trajectory of attention. We focus on internal attention because this aspect is most relevant to the immediate concerns of infancy, such as fluctuating levels of expertise, balancing multiple taxing skills simultaneously, learning how to control attention under variable conditions, and coordinating distinct psychological domains. Cognition-action trade-offs observed across the life span include perseveration during skill emergence, errors and inefficient strategies during decision making, and the allocation of resources when attention is taxed. An embodied cognitive-load account interprets these behavioral patterns as a result of limited attentional resources allocated across simultaneous, taxing task demands. For populations where motor errors could be costly, like infants and the elderly, attention is typically devoted to motor demands with errors occurring in the cognitive domain. In contrast, healthy young adults tend to preserve their cognitive performance by modifying their actions.",29455866,2018,Cognition-Action Trade-Offs Reflect Organization of Attention in Infancy.
547,"Genome-wide association analysis advanced understanding of blood pressure (BP), a major risk factor for vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Accounting for smoking behavior may help identify BP loci and extend our knowledge of its genetic architecture. We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic and diastolic BP incorporating gene-smoking interactions in 610,091 individuals. Stage 1 analysis examined ∼18.8 million SNPs and small insertion/deletion variants in 129,913 individuals from four ancestries (European, African, Asian, and Hispanic) with follow-up analysis of promising variants in 480,178 additional individuals from five ancestries. We identified 15 loci that were genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10-8) in stage 1 and formally replicated in stage 2. A combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analysis identified 66 additional genome-wide significant loci (13, 35, and 18 loci in European, African, and trans-ancestry, respectively). A total of 56 known BP loci were also identified by our results (p < 5 × 10-8). Of the newly identified loci, ten showed significant interaction with smoking status, but none of them were replicated in stage 2. Several loci were identified in African ancestry, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations. The identified loci show strong evidence for regulatory features and support shared pathophysiology with cardiometabolic and addiction traits. They also highlight a role in BP regulation for biological candidates such as modulators of vascular structure and function (CDKN1B, BCAR1-CFDP1, PXDN, EEA1), ciliopathies (SDCCAG8, RPGRIP1L), telomere maintenance (TNKS, PINX1, AKTIP), and central dopaminergic signaling (MSRA, EBF2).",29455858,2018,A Large-Scale Multi-ancestry Genome-wide Study Accounting for Smoking Behavior Identifies Multiple Significant Loci for Blood Pressure.
548,"BACKGROUND
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) effectively reduces fatigue directly following treatment in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but little is known about the process of change during and after CBT.


DESIGN
Additional analysis of a randomized clinical trial.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate which psychological factors mediate change in fatigue during and after CBT.


METHODS
TREFAMS-CBT studied the effectiveness of a 16-week CBT treatment for MS-related fatigue. Ninety-one patients were randomized (44 to CBT, 47 to the MS-nurse consultations). Mediation during CBT treatment was studied using assessments at baseline, 8 and 16weeks. Mediation of the change in fatigue from post-treatment to follow-up was studied separately using assessments at 16, 26 and 52weeks. Proposed mediators were: changes in illness cognitions, general self-efficacy, coping styles, daytime sleepiness, concentration and physical activity, fear of disease progression, fatigue perceptions, depression and physical functioning. Mediators were separately analysed according to the product-of-coefficients approach. Confidence intervals were calculated with a bootstrap procedure.


RESULTS
During treatment the decrease in fatigue brought on by CBT was mediated by improved fatigue perceptions, increased physical activity, less sleepiness, less helplessness, and improved physical functioning. Post-treatment increases in fatigue levels were mediated by reduced physical activity, reduced concentration, and increased sleepiness.


CONCLUSION
These results suggests that focusing on improving fatigue perceptions, perceived physical activity, daytime sleepiness, helplessness, and physical functioning may further improve the effectiveness of CBT for fatigue in patients with MS. Maintenance of treatment effects may be obtained by focusing on improving physical activity, concentration and sleepiness.",29455894,2018,Cognitive behavioural therapy for MS-related fatigue explained: A longitudinal mediation analysis.
549,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the role of a novel motivational perspective-sexual communal motivation-in women's pain during intercourse and both partners' distress in couples coping with vulvodynia, a prevalent gynecological pain condition. Our goal was to test whether sexual communal strength (i.e., motivation to meet a partner's sexual needs) and unmitigated sexual communion (i.e., prioritization of a partner's sexual needs in neglect of one's own needs) were indirectly associated with pain, depression, and anxiety via sexual distress.


METHODS
Couples (N=101) completed daily surveys about their sexual communal motivation, sexual distress, anxiety, depression, and women reported on their pain during intercourse. Using multilevel modeling, we examined how daily fluctuations in sexual communal motivation were directly and indirectly (via sexual distress) associated with pain and psychological distress.


RESULTS
On days when women with vulvodynia reported higher sexual communal strength, they reported less pain and anxiety, and on days when they reported higher unmitigated sexual communion, they reported more pain, more anxiety, and both partners reported more depressive symptoms. Daily associations between women's unmitigated sexual communion and greater pain, depression and anxiety were mediated by sexual distress.


CONCLUSIONS
Being motivated to meet a partner's sexual needs was associated with less pain and anxiety for women with vulvodynia, but when this motivation excluded a focus on one's own needs, there were detrimental consequences for women's pain and both partners' depressive symptoms. Interventions for improving women's pain and the psychological well-being of affected couples should target motivational factors and sexual distress.",29455897,2018,"Communal motivation in couples coping with vulvodynia: Sexual distress mediates associations with pain, depression, and anxiety."

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a complex etiology, involving the immune system, genetic factors, and external/internal triggers, with psychosomatic aspects. The aim of the study was to investigate childhood trauma and resilience in a psoriatic sample compared with healthy controls. Correlations between childhood trauma, resilience, quality of life, clinical data and psoriatic features were also evaluated.


METHODS
Seventy-seven psoriatic patients and seventy-six homogeneous healthy controls were enrolled. We used the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) to assess the severity of psoriasis and the Skindex-29 to measure health-related quality of life. The psychometric battery included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-Risc) to assess trauma exposure and resilience, respectively.


RESULTS
Psoriatic patients showed a significant prevalence of childhood trauma and a lower resilience level compared to healthy controls. Associations between traumatic experiences, low resilience and reduced quality of life in psoriatic subjects were also observed.


CONCLUSIONS
A multidisciplinary approach is helpful to investigate clinical aspects, trigger factors and psychophysiological stress response in psoriatic subjects. Improving resilience with an early psychological intervention focused on self-motivation and strengthening of self-efficacy could facilitate the management of psoriasis.",29455895,2018,Childhood trauma and resilience in psoriatic patients: A preliminary report.
551,"OBJECTIVE
Psychosocial stress is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in biomarkers that indicate whether individuals show adaptive (i.e., stress-buffering and health-promoting) or maladaptive (i.e., stress-escalating and health-impairing) stress reactions in social contexts. As heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested to be a biomarker of adaptive behavior during social encounters, it may be possible that inter-individual differences in HRV are associated with inter-individual differences regarding stress in distinct social domains.


METHODS
To test this hypothesis, resting state HRV and psychosocial stress was assessed in 83 healthy community-dwelling individuals (age: 18-35years). HRV was derived from heart rate recordings during spontaneous and instructed breathing to assess the robustness of possible associations between inter-individual differences in HRV and inter-individual differences in psychosocial stress. Psychosocial stress was determined with a self-report questionnaire assessing stress in distinct social domains.


RESULTS
A series of categorical and dimensional analyses revealed an association between inter-individual differences in HRV and inter-individual differences in psychosocial stress: Individuals with high HRV reported less stress in social life, but not in family life, work life or everyday life, than individuals with low HRV.


CONCLUSIONS
On basis of these findings, it may be assumed that individuals with high HRV experience less psychosocial stress than individuals with low HRV. Although such an assumption needs to be corroborated by further findings, it seems to be consistent with previous findings showing that individuals with high HRV suffer less from stress and stress-related disorders than individuals with low HRV.",29455900,2018,Heart rate variability is associated with psychosocial stress in distinct social domains.

It was proven that the free hydroxyl groups are weakened and tend to disappear with fiber treatment. It is the same for intermolecular hydrogen bands between cellulosic chains that present a decrease in both intensity and frequency.

557,"INTRODUCTION
The effectiveness of self-guided Internet-based lifestyle counseling (e-counseling) varies, depending on treatment protocol. Two dominant procedures in e-counseling are expert- and user-driven. The influence of these procedures on hypertension management remains unclear. The objective was to assess whether blood pressure improved with expert-driven or user-driven e-counseling over control intervention in patients with hypertension over a 4-month period.


STUDY DESIGN
This study used a three-parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled design.


SETTING/PARTICIPANTS
In Toronto, Canada, 128 participants (aged 35-74 years) with hypertension were recruited. Participants were recruited using online and poster advertisements. Data collection took place between June 2012 and June 2014. Data were analyzed from October 2014 to December 2016.


INTERVENTION
Controls received a weekly e-mail newsletter regarding hypertension management. The expert-driven group was prescribed a weekly exercise and diet plan (e.g., increase 1,000 steps/day this week). The user-driven group received weekly e-mail, which allowed participants to choose their intervention goals (e.g., [1] feel more confident to change my lifestyle, or [2] self-help tips for exercise or a heart healthy diet).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Primary outcome was systolic blood pressure measured at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included cholesterol, 10-year Framingham cardiovascular risk, daily steps, and dietary habits.


RESULTS
Expert-driven groups showed a greater systolic blood pressure decrease than controls at follow-up (expert-driven versus control: -7.5 mmHg, 95% CI= -12.5, -2.6, p=0.01). Systolic blood pressure reduction did not significantly differ between user- and expert-driven. Expert-driven compared with controls also showed a significant improvement in pulse pressure, cholesterol, and Framingham risk score. The expert-driven intervention was significantly more effective than both user-driven and control groups in increasing daily steps and fruit intake.


CONCLUSIONS
It may be advisable to incorporate an expert-driven e-counseling protocol in order to accommodate participants with greater motivation to change their lifestyle behaviors, but more studies are needed.

558,"Covert motor learning can sometimes transfer to overt behavior. We investigated the neural mechanism underlying transfer by constructing a two-context paradigm. Subjects performed cursor movements either overtly using arm movements, or covertly via a brain-machine interface that moves the cursor based on motor cortical activity (in lieu of arm movement). These tasks helped evaluate whether and how cortical changes resulting from ""covert rehearsal"" affect overt performance. We found that covert learning indeed transfers to overt performance and is accompanied by systematic population-level changes in motor preparatory activity. Current models of motor cortical function ascribe motor preparation to achieving initial conditions favorable for subsequent movement-period neural dynamics. We found that covert and overt contexts share these initial conditions, and covert rehearsal manipulates them in a manner that persists across context changes, thus facilitating overt motor learning. This transfer learning mechanism might provide new insights into other covert processes like mental rehearsal.",29456026,2018,Neural Population Dynamics Underlying Motor Learning Transfer.
559,"We investigated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in children and young adults with unilateral cerebral palsy. Twenty participants were randomized to receive active or sham tDCS. The intervention consisted of 10 consecutive weekday sessions of tDCS applied to the non-lesioned hemisphere (20 min) concurrently with CIMT (120 min). Participants, caregivers, and interventionists were blinded to group assignment. The primary safety outcome investigated adverse events. The primary behavioral outcome was the Assisting Hand Assessment. All 20 participants (mean age = 12.7 yrs, range = 7.4-21.6 years) were evaluated for the primary outcomes. No serious adverse events occurred, and the most commonly reported minor adverse events were headache and itchiness. Both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in hand function after the intervention, although no significant effect of tDCS was observed (between-group difference = -2.18, 95% CI = [-6.48, 2.12], p = 0.30). Although hand function improved overall, no significant differences between intervention groups were found. Children with preserved corticospinal tract circuitry from the lesioned hemisphere, compared to those without, showed greater improvement in hand function (mean difference = 3.04, 95% CI = [-0.64, 6.72], p = 0.099). Our study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of serial sessions of tDCS, and presents preliminary evidence for the effect of CST circuitry on outcomes following tDCS/CIMT. Future work in children with unilateral cerebral palsy should focus on the optimal dosing and consider individual brain circuitry when describing response to combined interventions.

Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of dyslexia via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of profound, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.",29456133,2018,No evidence for systematic white matter correlates of dyslexia: An Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis.
561,"Sensory cortical systems often activate in parallel, even when stimulation is experienced through a single sensory modality [1-3]. Co-activations may reflect the interactive coupling between information-linked cortical systems or merely parallel but independent sensory processing. We report causal evidence consistent with the hypothesis that human somatosensory cortex (S1), which co-activates with auditory cortex during the processing of vibrations and textures [4-9], interactively couples to cortical systems that support auditory perception. In a series of behavioral experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe interactions between the somatosensory and auditory perceptual systems as we manipulated attention state. Acute TMS over S1 impairs auditory frequency perception when subjects simultaneously attend to auditory and tactile frequency, but not when attention is directed to audition alone. Auditory frequency perception is unaffected by TMS over visual cortex, thus confirming the privileged interactions between the somatosensory and auditory systems in temporal frequency processing [10-13]. Our results provide a key demonstration that selective attention can modulate the functional properties of cortical systems thought to support specific sensory modalities. The gating of crossmodal coupling by selective attention may critically support multisensory interactions and feature-specific perception.",29456139,2018,Selective Attention Gates the Interactive Crossmodal Coupling between Perceptual Systems.
562,"Visual selective attention is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows us to process relevant visual stimuli while ignoring irrelevant distracters and has been extensively studied in human and non-human primate subjects. Mice have emerged as a powerful animal model for studying aspects of the visual system but have not yet been shown to exhibit visual selective attention. Differences in the organization of the visual systems of primates and mice raise the possibility that selective visual attention might not be present in mice, at least not in the forms that are well established in primates. Here, we tested for selective visual attention in mice by using three behavioral paradigms adapted from classic studies of attention. In a Posner-style cueing task, a spatial cue indicated the probable location of the relevant visual event, and we found that accuracy was higher and reaction times were shorter on validly cued trials. In a cue versus no-cue task, an informative spatial cue was provided on half the trials, and mice had higher accuracy and shorter reaction times with spatial cues and also lower detection thresholds measured from psychometric curves. In a filter task, the spatial cue indicated the location of the relevant visual event, and we found that mice could be trained to ignore irrelevant but otherwise identical visual events at uncued locations. Together, these results demonstrate that mice exhibit visual selective attention, paving the way to use classic attention paradigms in mice to study the genetic and neuronal circuit mechanisms of selective attention.",29456140,2018,Visual Selective Attention in Mice.
563,"In dynamic environments, split-second sensorimotor decisions must be prioritized according to potential payoffs to maximize overall rewards. The impact of relative value on deliberative perceptual judgments has been examined extensively [1-6], but relatively little is known about value-biasing mechanisms in the common situation where physical evidence is strong but the time to act is severely limited. In prominent decision models, a noisy but statistically stationary representation of sensory evidence is integrated over time to an action-triggering bound, and value-biases are affected by starting the integrator closer to the more valuable bound. Here, we show significant departures from this account for humans making rapid sensory-instructed action choices. Behavior was best explained by a simple model in which the evidence representation-and hence, rate of accumulation-is itself biased by value and is non-stationary, increasing over the short decision time frame. Because the value bias initially dominates, the model uniquely predicts a dynamic ""turn-around"" effect on low-value cues, where the accumulator first launches toward the incorrect action but is then re-routed to the correct one. This was clearly exhibited in electrophysiological signals reflecting motor preparation and evidence accumulation. Finally, we construct an extended model that implements this dynamic effect through plausible sensory neural response modulations and demonstrate the correspondence between decision signal dynamics simulated from a behavioral fit of that model and the empirical decision signals. Our findings suggest that value and sensory information can exert simultaneous and dynamically countervailing influences on the trajectory of the accumulation-to-bound process, driving rapid, sensory-guided actions.",29456147,2018,Dynamic Interplay of Value and Sensory Information in High-Speed Decision Making.
564,"The dynamics of the center of mass (CoM) during walking and running at various gait conditions are well described by the mechanics of a simple passive spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). Due to its simplicity, however, the current form of the SLIP model is limited at providing any further information about multi-segmental lower limbs that generate oscillatory CoM behaviors and their corresponding ground reaction forces. Considering that the dynamics of the CoM are simply achieved by mass-spring mechanics, we wondered whether any of the multi-joint motions could be demonstrated by simple mechanics. In this study, we expand a SLIP model of human locomotion with an off-centered curvy foot connected to the leg by a springy segment that emulates the asymmetric kinematics and kinetics of the ankle joint. The passive dynamics of the proposed expansion of the SLIP model demonstrated the empirical data of ground reaction forces, center of mass trajectories, ankle joint kinematics and corresponding ankle joint torque at various gait speeds. From the mechanically simulated trajectories of the ankle joint and CoM, the motion of lower-limb segments, such as thigh and shank angles, could be estimated from inverse kinematics. The estimation of lower limb kinematics showed a qualitative match with empirical data of walking at various speeds. The representability of passive compliant mechanics for the kinetics of the CoM and ankle joint and lower limb joint kinematics implies that the coordination of multi-joint lower limbs during gait can be understood with a mechanical framework.",29456169,2018,"Kinematics of lower limbs during walking are emulated by springy walking model with a compliantly connected, off-centered curvy foot."
565,"Mitochondrial crista structure partitions vital cellular reactions and is precisely regulated by diverse cellular signals. Here, we show that, in Drosophila, mitochondrial cristae undergo dynamic remodeling among distinct subcellular regions and the Parkinson's disease (PD)-linked Ser/Thr kinase PINK1 participates in their regulation. Mitochondria increase crista junctions and numbers in selective subcellular areas, and this remodeling requires PINK1 to phosphorylate the inner mitochondrial membrane protein MIC60/mitofilin, which stabilizes MIC60 oligomerization. Expression of MIC60 restores crista structure and ATP levels of PINK1-null flies and remarkably rescues their behavioral defects and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In an extension to human relevance, we discover that the PINK1-MIC60 pathway is conserved in human neurons, and expression of several MIC60 coding variants in the mitochondrial targeting sequence found in PD patients in Drosophila impairs crista junction formation and causes locomotion deficits. These findings highlight the importance of maintenance and plasticity of crista junctions to cellular homeostasis in vivo.",29456190,2018,PINK1 Phosphorylates MIC60/Mitofilin to Control Structural Plasticity of Mitochondrial Crista Junctions.

We study a program called Becoming a Man (BAM), developed by the nonprofit Youth Guidance, in two RCTs implemented in 2009-2010 and 2013-2015. In the two studies participation in the program reduced total arrests during the intervention period by 28-35%, reduced violent-crime arrests by 45-50%, improved school engagement, and in the first study where we have follow-up data, increased graduation rates by 12-19%. The third RCT tested a program with partially overlapping components carried out in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), which reduced readmission rates to the facility by 21%. These large behavioral responses combined with modest program costs imply benefit-cost ratios for these interventions from 5-to-1 up to 30-to-1 or more. Our data on mechanisms are not ideal, but we find no positive evidence that these effects are due to changes in emotional intelligence or social skills, self-control or ""grit,"" or a generic mentoring effect. We find suggestive support for the hypothesis that the programs work by helping youth slow down and reflect on whether their automatic thoughts and behaviors are well suited to the situation they are in, or whether the situation could be construed differently.

568,"A growing body of literature has begun to explore social attention in infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with hopes of identifying early differences that are associated with later ASD or other aspects of development. The present study used eye-tracking to familiar (mother) and unfamiliar (stranger) faces in two groups of 6-month-old infants: infants with no family history of ASD (low-risk controls; LRC), and infants at high risk for ASD (HRA), by virtue of having an older sibling with ASD. HRA infants were further characterized based on autism classification at 24 months or older as HRA- (HRA without an ASD outcome) or HRA+ (HRA with an ASD outcome). For time scanning faces overall, HRA+ and LRC showed similar patterns of attention, and this was significantly greater than in HRA-. When examining duration of time spent on eyes and mouth, all infants spent more time on eyes than mouth, but HRA+ showed the greatest amount of time looking at these regions, followed by LRC, then HRA-. LRC showed a positive association between 6-month attention to eyes and 18-month social-communicative behavior, while HRA- showed a negative association between attention to eyes at 6 months and expressive language at 18 months (all correlations controlled for non-verbal IQ; HRA- correlations held with and without the inclusion of the small sample of HRA+). Differences found in face scanning at 6 months, as well as associations with social communication at 18 months, point to potential variation in the developmental significance of early social attention in children at low and high risk for ASD.",29456277,2018,Differential Attention to Faces in Infant Siblings of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Associations with Later Social and Language Ability.

571,"Introduction
Alcohol dependence syndrome is a major public health issue globally and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. The total dose of alcohol consumed has been linked to liver diseases, pancreatitis, and other alcohol-related medical consequences. However, this has not been studied in relation to severity of dependence; although it is well known that alcohol causes neuronal damage, which in turn potentiates dependence. Thus, there is a need to study the relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and severity of dependence.


Materials and Methods
A total of 165 consecutive cases of alcohol dependence syndrome were studied in a General Hospital Psychiatry Unit at a tertiary care hospital. Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was used to evaluate the severity of alcohol dependence, and Life Time Alcohol Consumption (LTAC) was evaluated by taking careful history. Correlation coefficients were calculated between ASI and LTAC. Group differences were analyzed using t-test.


Results
There was a significant correlation between ASI and LTAC (r = 0.162, P = 0.032), which was highly significant in the subgroup without medical complications (r = 0.250, P = 0.003). A similar correlation in the medical complications subgroup was not significant.


Conclusions
Lifetime alcohol consumption co-related with the severity of alcohol dependence, particularly in those presenting without medical complications (i.e., those with behavioral and social consequences, and injuries).",29456319,2017,Lifetime alcohol consumption and severity in alcohol dependence syndrome.

In a cross-sectional study, 75 academically typically achieving adolescents were compared with 105 students with academic difficulty and 52 students with specific learning disability (SLD). Academic functioning was assessed using teacher's screening instrument, intelligence quotient, and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences index for SLD. Stress and suicidal ideas were assessed using general health questionnaire, suicide risk-11, and Mooney Problem Checklist (MPC). Appropriate statistical methods were applied.


Results
Three groups were comparable on age, gender, mother's working status, being only child, nuclear family, self-reported academic decline, and type of school. About half of adolescents reported psychological problems on General Health Questionnaire (mean score >3 in all the groups). Academically typically achieving adolescents showed higher stressors in peer relationships, planning for future and suicidal ideation compared to adolescents with academic difficulty. Adolescents face stress regarding worry about examinations, family not understanding what child has to do in school, unfair tests, too much work in some subjects, afraid of failure in school work, not spending enough time in studies, parental expectations, wanting to be more popular, worried about a family member, planning for the future, and fear of the future. Significant positive correlation was seen between General Health Questionnaire scores and all four subscales of MPC. Suicidal ideas showed a negative correlation with MPC.

583,"Microelectromechanical systems remain an area of significant interest in fundamental and applied research due to their wide ranging applications. Most device designs, however, are largely two-dimensional and constrained to only a few simple geometries. Achieving tunable resonant frequencies or broad operational bandwidths requires complex components and/or fabrication processes. The work presented here reports unusual classes of three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical systems in the form of vibratory platforms assembled by controlled compressive buckling. Such 3D structures can be fabricated across a broad range of length scales and from various materials, including soft polymers, monocrystalline silicon, and their composites, resulting in a wide scope of achievable resonant frequencies and mechanical behaviors. Platforms designed with multistable mechanical responses and vibrationally de-coupled constituent elements offer improved bandwidth and frequency tunability. Furthermore, the resonant frequencies can be controlled through deformations of an underlying elastomeric substrate. Systematic experimental and computational studies include structures with diverse geometries, ranging from tables, cages, rings, ring-crosses, ring-disks, two-floor ribbons, flowers, umbrellas, triple-cantilever platforms, and asymmetric circular helices, to multilayer constructions.

Only little is known about the psychosocial aspects of breast cancer patients after mastectomy with immediate versus delayed breast reconstruction.


Methods
We systematically screened PubMed using the following key words: mastectomy, immediate vs. delayed reconstruction, psychosocial aspects and quality of life. To highlight different psychological outcomes, studies were categorized into those describing: anxiety, depression, body image and satisfaction with the surgical outcome. We also compared patients after mastectomy alone with those undergoing immediate or delayed reconstruction.


Results
Methodologies and psychological outcomes varied among the identified studies, making it difficult to compare results. There are contradictory outcomes concerning the psychosocial aspects of breast cancer patients after mastectomy alone compared with those who underwent an immediate or delayed reconstruction following mastectomy. Some studies show that immediate reconstruction after mastectomy had a positive impact on patients' psychological well-being.

585,"Breast cancer is the most common cause of skin metastases in women. The probability of their occurrence ranges from about 5% in the entire population to as much as 30% in the late stages of the disease. Although rarely life-threatening, they have a major impact on the quality of life of patients with this diagnosis, being the cause of pain, effusion, ulceration, infection, and psychological discomfort. Available methods of treatment, both local and systemic, often fail to provide adequate control of the disease. A particular challenge seems to be the treatment of those patients with cutaneous metastases who, due to the extent of their metastases, are not eligible for resection, in whom the possibility of radiation therapy has already been used, and in whom systemic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. A new method providing the opportunity for effective treatment is electrochemotherapy (ECT). ECT combines electropulsation of tumor cells (by local application of electric pulses) and administration of antineoplastic drugs such as cisplatin or bleomycin (either intravenous or intratumoral). Several clinical studies have demonstrated that ECT provides safe, efﬁcient, and non-invasive locoregional treatment for chest wall breast cancer recurrence.",29456474,2017,Electrochemotherapy in Breast Cancer - Discussion of the Method and Literature Review.
586,"Emerging evidence suggest an impaired endocannabinoid activity in the pathophysiology of binge eating disorder (BED). Herein, we investigated whether endocannabinoid tone could be modified as a consequence of dietary-induced binge eating in female rats. For this purpose, brain levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), as well as two endocannabinoid-like lipids, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), were assessed in different brain areas involved in the hedonic feeding (i.e., prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus). The brain density of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1) was also evaluated. Furthermore, we determined plasma levels of leptin, ghrelin, and corticosterone hormones, which are well-known to control the levels of endocannabioids and/or CB1 receptors in the brain. To induce binge eating behavior, rats were subject to an intermittent and limited access to a high fat diet (HFD) (margarine). Three experimental groups were used, all with ad libitum access to chow: control (CTRL), with no access to margarine; low restriction (LR), with 2 h margarine access 7 days/week; high restriction (HR), with 2 h margarine access 3 days/week. Bingeing was established when margarine intake in the HR group exceeded that of the LR group. Our results show that, compared to CTRL, AEA significantly decreased in the caudate putamen, amygdala, and hippocampus of HR group. In contrast, 2-AG significantly increased in the hippocampus while OEA decreased in the hypothalamus. Similar to the HR group, AEA and OEA decreased respectively in the amygdala and hypothalamus and 2-AG increased in the hippocampus of LR group. Moreover, LR group also had AEA decreased in the prefrontal cortex and increased in the nucleus accumbens. In both groups we found the same reduction of CB1 receptor density in the prefrontal cortex compared to CTRL. Also, LR and HR groups showed alterations in both ghrelin and corticosterone levels, while leptin remained unaltered. In conclusion, our findings show a modified endocannabinoid tone due to margarine exposure, in several brain areas that are known to influence the hedonic aspect of food. Even if not uniquely specific to binge eating, margarine-induced changes in endocannabinoid tone could contributes to the development and maintenance of this behavior.",29456490,2018,Limited Access to a High Fat Diet Alters Endocannabinoid Tone in Female Rats.
587,"Task-switching is an important cognitive skill that facilitates our ability to choose appropriate behavior in a varied and changing environment. Task-switching training studies have sought to improve this ability by practicing switching between multiple tasks. However, an efficacious training paradigm has been difficult to develop in part due to findings that small differences in task parameters influence switching behavior in a non-trivial manner. Here, for the first time we employ the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to understand the influence of feedback on task-switching and investigate how drift diffusion parameters change over the course of task switch training. We trained 316 participants on a simple task where they alternated sorting stimuli by color or by shape. Feedback differed in six different ways between subjects groups, ranging from No Feedback (NFB) to a variety of manipulations addressing trial-wise vs. Block Feedback (BFB), rewards vs. punishments, payment bonuses and different payouts depending upon the trial type (switch/non-switch). While overall performance was found to be affected by feedback, no effect of feedback was found on task-switching learning. Drift Diffusion Modeling revealed that the reductions in reaction time (RT) switch cost over the course of training were driven by a continually decreasing decision boundary. Furthermore, feedback effects on RT switch cost were also driven by differences in decision boundary, but not in drift rate. These results reveal that participants systematically modified their task-switching performance without yielding an overall gain in performance.",29456494,2018,The Influence of Feedback on Task-Switching Performance: A Drift Diffusion Modeling Account.
588,"Trust is essential for mutually beneficial human interactions in economic exchange and politics and people's social identities notably have dramatic effects on trust behaviors toward others. Previous literature concerning social identities generally suggests that people tend to show in-group favoritism toward members who share the same identity. However, how our brains process signals of identity while facing uncertain situations in interpersonal interactions remains largely unclear. To address this issue, we performed an fMRI experiment with 54 healthy adults who belonged to two identity groups of opposing political orientations. The identity information of participants was extracted from a large-scale social survey on the 2012 Taiwan presidential election. Accordingly, participants were categorized as either the Kuomintang (KMT) or the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supporters. During the experiment, participants played trust games with computer agents with labels of the same or the opposing political identity. Interestingly, our results suggest that the behaviors of the two groups cannot be equally attributed to in-group favoritism. Behaviorally, only the DPP supporter group showed a significant trust preference toward in-group members, which did not hold for the KMT supporter group. Consistently, neurophysiological findings further revealed that only the DPP supporter group showed neuronal responses to both unexpected negative feedback from in-group members in anterior insula, temporoparietal junction, and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as to unexpected rewards from out-group members in caudate. These findings therefore suggest that acquired identities play a more complex role in modulating people's social expectation in interpersonal trust behaviors under identity-relevant contexts.",29456496,2018,How Do Acquired Political Identities Influence Our Neural Processing toward Others within the Context of a Trust Game?
589,"Recent debates about the conventional traditional threshold used in the fields of neuroscience and psychology, namely P < 0.05, have spurred researchers to consider alternative ways to analyze fMRI data. A group of methodologists and statisticians have considered Bayesian inference as a candidate methodology. However, few previous studies have attempted to provide end users of fMRI analysis tools, such as SPM 12, with practical guidelines about how to conduct Bayesian inference. In the present study, we aim to demonstrate how to utilize Bayesian inference, Bayesian second-level inference in particular, implemented in SPM 12 by analyzing fMRI data available to public via NeuroVault. In addition, to help end users understand how Bayesian inference actually works in SPM 12, we examine outcomes from Bayesian second-level inference implemented in SPM 12 by comparing them with those from classical second-level inference. Finally, we provide practical guidelines about how to set the parameters for Bayesian inference and how to interpret the results, such as Bayes factors, from the inference. We also discuss the practical and philosophical benefits of Bayesian inference and directions for future research.",29456498,2018,Using SPM 12's Second-Level Bayesian Inference Procedure for fMRI Analysis: Practical Guidelines for End Users.
590,"Most transhumeral amputees report that their prosthetic device lacks functionality, citing the control strategy as a major limitation. Indeed, they are required to control several degrees of freedom with muscle groups primarily used for elbow actuation. As a result, most of them choose to have a one-degree-of-freedom myoelectric hand for grasping objects, a myoelectric wrist for pronation/supination, and a body-powered elbow. Unlike healthy upper limb movements, the prosthetic elbow joint angle, adjusted prior to the motion, is not involved in the overall upper limb movements, causing the rest of the body to compensate for the lack of mobility of the prosthesis. A promising solution to improve upper limb prosthesis control exploits the residual limb mobility: like in healthy movements, shoulder and prosthetic elbow motions are coupled using inter-joint coordination models. The present study aims to test this approach. A transhumeral amputated individual used a prosthesis with a residual limb motion-driven elbow to point at targets. The prosthetic elbow motion was derived from IMU-based shoulder measurements and a generic model of inter-joint coordinations built from healthy individuals data. For comparison, the participant also performed the task while the prosthetic elbow was implemented with his own myoelectric control strategy. The results show that although the transhumeral amputated participant achieved the pointing task with a better precision when the elbow was myoelectrically-controlled, he had to develop large compensatory trunk movements. Automatic elbow control reduced trunk displacements, and enabled a more natural body behavior with synchronous shoulder and elbow motions. However, due to socket impairments, the residual limb amplitudes were not as large as those of healthy shoulder movements. Therefore, this work also investigates if a control strategy whereby prosthetic joints are automatized according to healthy individuals' coordination models can lead to an intuitive and natural prosthetic control.",29456499,2018,Can We Achieve Intuitive Prosthetic Elbow Control Based on Healthy Upper Limb Motor Strategies?
591,"Trace amines (TAs), endogenous amino acid metabolites that are structurally similar to the biogenic amines, are endogenous ligands for trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a GPCR that modulates dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic activity. Selective TAAR1 full and partial agonists exhibit similar pro-cognitive, antidepressant- and antipsychotic-like properties in rodents and non-human primates, suggesting TAAR1 as a novel target for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that TAAR1 partial agonists are wake-promoting in rats and mice, and that TAAR1 knockout (KO) and overexpressing mice exhibit altered sleep-wake and EEG spectral composition. Here, we report that locomotor and EEG spectral responses to the psychostimulants modafinil and caffeine are attenuated in TAAR1 KO mice. TAAR1 KO mice and WT littermates were instrumented for EEG and EMG recording and implanted with telemetry transmitters for monitoring locomotor activity (LMA) and core body temperature (Tb). Following recovery, mice were administered modafinil (25, 50, 100 mg/kg), caffeine (2.5, 10, 20 mg/kg) or vehicle p.o. at ZT6 in balanced order. In WT mice, both modafinil and caffeine dose-dependently increased LMA for up to 6 h following dosing, whereas only the highest dose of each drug increased LMA in KO mice, and did so for less time after dosing. This effect was particularly pronounced following caffeine, such that total LMA response was significantly attenuated in KO mice compared to WT at all doses of caffeine and did not differ from Vehicle treatment. Tb increased comparably in both genotypes in a dose-dependent manner. TAAR1 deletion was associated with reduced wake consolidation following both drugs, but total time in wakefulness did not differ between KO and WT mice. Furthermore, gamma band EEG activity following both modafinil and caffeine treatment was attenuated in TAAR1 KO compared to WT mice. Our results show that TAAR1 is a critical component of the behavioral and cortical arousal associated with two widely used psychostimulants with very different mechanisms of action. Together with our previous findings, these data suggest that TAAR1 is a previously unrecognized component of an endogenous wake-modulating system.",29456505,2018,Deletion of Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Attenuates Behavioral Responses to Caffeine.
592,"Humans are born completely dependent on adult care for survival. To get the necessary support, newborns rely on socio-communicative abilities which have both innate and learned components. Maternal responsiveness (MR), as a critical aspect of mother-infant interaction, is a robust predictor of the acquisition of socio-communicative abilities. However, maternal responsiveness (MR) is influenced by parity, since mothers rely on a limited capacity of cognitive control for efficient attachment with their offspring. This fact is of particular concern for preterms, whose developing brain already faces many challenges due to their premature emergence from the womb's controlled environment and may still have to compete with siblings for mother's attention. Thus, in the present work, we aimed to understand how parity interferes with MR and whether it affects the development of socio-communicative abilities of preterm infants. We used the Social Interaction Rating Scale (SIRS) and the mother-child observation protocol in 18 dyads with gestational age <36 weeks. Dyads were separated into three groups: primiparous with twin pregnancy (TPM), primiparous (PM), and multiparous (MP). Dyadic behavior was evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Our results show that offspring size affects MR, but not the socio-communicative development of preterm infants during the first year, suggesting a level of resilience of brain systems supporting the attachment to caregivers.",29456516,2018,The Socio-Communicative Development of Preterm Infants Is Resistant to the Negative Effects of Parity on Maternal Responsiveness.
593,"Wineries face unprecedented challenges due to new market demands and climate change effects on wine quality. New yeast starters including non-conventional Saccharomyces species, such as S. kudriavzevii, may contribute to deal with some of these challenges. The design of new fermentations using non-conventional yeasts requires an improved understanding of the physiology and metabolism of these cells. Dynamic modeling brings the potential of exploring the most relevant mechanisms and designing optimal processes more systematically. In this work we explore mechanisms by means of a model selection, reduction and cross-validation pipeline which enables to dissect the most relevant fermentation features for the species under consideration, Saccharomyces cerevisiae T73 and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii CR85. The pipeline involved the comparison of a collection of models which incorporate several alternative mechanisms with emphasis on the inhibitory effects due to temperature and ethanol. We focused on defining a minimal model with the minimum number of parameters, to maximize the identifiability and the quality of cross-validation. The selected model was then used to highlight differences in behavior between species. The analysis of model parameters would indicate that the specific growth rate and the transport of hexoses at initial times are higher for S. cervisiae T73 while S. kudriavzevii CR85 diverts more flux for glycerol production and cellular maintenance. As a result, the fermentations with S. kudriavzevii CR85 are typically slower; produce less ethanol but higher glycerol. Finally, we also explored optimal initial inoculation and process temperature to find the best compromise between final product characteristics and fermentation duration. Results reveal that the production of glycerol is distinctive in S. kudriavzevii CR85, it was not possible to achieve the same production of glycerol with S. cervisiae T73 in any of the conditions tested. This result brings the idea that the optimal design of mixed cultures may have an enormous potential for the improvement of final wine quality.",29456524,2018,Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii Synthetic Wine Fermentation Performance Dissected by Predictive Modeling.
594,"Persistent use of permethrin has resulted in its ubiquitous presence as a contaminant in surface streams and soils, yet little is known about the kinetics and metabolic behaviors of this pesticide. In this study, a novel bacterial strain Acinetobacter baumannii ZH-14 utilizing permethrin via partial hydrolysis pathways was isolated from sewage sludge. Response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design of cultural conditions was used for optimization resulting in 100% degradation of permethrin (50 mg·L-1) within 72 h. Strain ZH-14 degraded permethrin up to a concentration of 800 mg·L-1. Biodegradation kinetics analysis indicated that permethrin degradation by this strain was concentration dependent, with a maximum specific degradation rate, half-saturation constant, and inhibition constant of 0.0454 h-1, 4.7912 mg·L-1, and 367.2165 mg·L-1, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified 3-phenoxybenzenemethanol and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde as the major intermediate metabolites of the permethrin degradation pathway. Bioaugmentation of permethrin-contaminated soils with strain ZH-14 significantly enhanced degradation, and over 85% of permethrin was degraded within 9 days with the degradation process following the first-order kinetic model. In addition to degradation of permethrin, strain ZH-14 was capable of degrading a large range of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, cyhalothrin, and beta-cypermethrin which are also widely used pesticides with environmental contamination problems, suggesting the promising potentials of A. baumannii ZH-14 in bioremediation of pyrethroid-contaminated terrestrial and aquatic environments.",29456525,2018,Kinetics and Novel Degradation Pathway of Permethrin in Acinetobacter baumannii ZH-14.

The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of the root aqueous extract of Entada africana (EA) on an experimental model of endometriosis. The study was performed in rats orally treated with EA at doses of 127.5, 255, and 510 mg/kg. Microgynon® 30 served as the reference substance. Estradiol valerate and oxytocin were used to induce dysmenorrhea. Endometrial implant levels of catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) allowed estimating tissue oxidative status. Ovarian dynamic and rat sexual behavior were assessed through histological analysis of ovaries, uterus, and vagina. EA decreased dysmenorrhea at tested doses following a 7-day treatment (p < 0.001). Endometrial implant volume decreased following the three treatment periods (p < 0.05). Catalase activity (p < 0.001) and MDA level (p < 0.01) increased only following a 3-day treatment. EA also increased antral follicles, reduced luteinized unruptured follicle number (p < 0.001), and induced animals to be in the estrus phase. In conclusion, EA prevented the progress of endometriosis, reduced dysmenorrhea, promoted ovarian follicle growth, prevented anovulation, and stimulated the special period of rat sexual desire. These results suggest that Entada africana could be a promising alternative option for the treatment of endometriosis.",29456574,2017,"The Root Aqueous Extract of Entada africana Guill. et Perr.

In the present study, cancer tissues and normal tissues were extracted from patients with CRC who were treated in the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Jinan, China). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression level of miR-766-5p was significantly higher (P<0.01) in cancer tissue than that in normal tissue. SW480 cells were used for in vitro study and randomly separated into the miR-negative control (NC) inhibitor treatment group and miR-766-5p inhibitor treatment group.

Results demonstrated that in the miR-766-5p inhibitor group, there was a decreased level of cell proliferation/migration/invasion and higher cell apoptosis compared with that in the miR-NC inhibitor group. miR-766-5p was predicted and verified to target the 3' untranslated region of suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) in SW480 cells. Protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT were decreased and SCAI was increased following miR-766-5p inhibitor treatment.

Methods
A sample of 1000 students in 8th to 10th grades was randomly selected from 16 schools in Irbid, Jordan. A self-reported questionnaire including attitude related questions was used in a descriptive, cross-sectional study.


Results
Generally, the students expressed positive attitudes toward obesity; which means that their attitudes were consistent with societal norms in terms of health and social functioning (mean= 3.5, SD=0.39). Furthermore, the students expressed positive attitudes toward lifestyle; which means that their attitudes were consistent with healthy behaviors (mean=3.7, SD=0.58). However, boys had significantly more positive attitudes than girls (p=0.04). The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 23.8%, while obese and non-obese students had similar attitudes toward lifestyle and obesity. Finally, around 20% to 30% of students desired a prevention program out of school time shared with their families and friends and involves eating healthy food and getting more exercise.

We examined economic decision-making about risk and time in situations in which deciders chose for others who also chose for them. We propose that this unique setting, which has not been studied before, elicits perception of reciprocity that prompts a unique bias in preferences. We found that decision-makers are less patient (more discounting), and more risk averse for losses than gains, with other peoples' money, especially when their choices for others are more uncertain. Those results were derived by exploiting a computational modeling framework that has been shown to account for the underlying psychological and neural decision processes.

A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in Soba locality, Khartoum, Sudan. An interviewer-administrated questionnaire was assigned to 462 residents of the area living in four geographically distributed squares around the sewage plant. The data was analyzed in SPSS; Cronbach's alpha reliability scale of measurement was used to check the internal validity of six variables related to the quality of life. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the health hazards and the quality of life. Among the 462 residents, difficulty in breathing (37.9%) and nausea (37.2) were the principal health hazards. Moreover, the residents had a satisfactory level of awareness (88.7%) about the health hazards. The utmost impact on the quality of life was psychological (97.2%). It was statistically correlated with the reported factors, which impacted the quality of life in the district as revealed by the Cronbach's alpha reliability test with absenteeism (P=0.026), disability (P=0.014), socialization (P=0.032) and death (P=0.016). A logistic regression analysis revealed chemical hazards had a statistically significant association (P<0.05) with quality of life of the residents of Soba district.

601,"Background
Impaired social interaction is one of the essential features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our previous copy number variation (CNV) study discovered a novel deleted region associated with ASD. One of the genes included in the deleted region is ARHGEF10. A missense mutation of ARHGEF10 has been reported to be one of the contributing factors in several diseases of the central nervous system. However, the relationship between the loss of ARHGEF10 and the clinical symptoms of ASD is unclear.


Methods
We generated Arhgef10 knockout mice as a model of ASD and characterized the social behavior and the biochemical changes in the brains of the knockout mice.


Results
Compared with their wild-type littermates, the Arhgef10-depleted mice showed social interaction impairment, hyperactivity, and decreased depression-like and anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral measures of learning in the Morris water maze were not affected by Arhgef10 deficiency. Moreover, neurotransmitters including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine were significantly increased in different brain regions of the Arhgef10 knockout mice. In addition, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) decreased in several brain regions.


Conclusions
These results suggest that ARHGEF10 is a candidate risk gene for ASD and that the Arhgef10 knockout model could be a tool for studying the mechanisms of neurotransmission in ASD.

Decreased expression of CBR1 is associated with disease progression and an unfavorable outcome in several types of malignancies. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether CBR1 expression could be a useful prognostic factor in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Therefore, its mechanisms of action were investigated in order to understand how CBR1 affects cancer cell behavior in vitro. CBR1 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and tissue samples obtained from 90 patients with OSCC. The associations between CBR1 expression, clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival were also analyzed. In addition, the role of CBR1 in cancer cell invasion and metastasis was examined, along with its underlying molecular mechanisms, via transfecting CBR1-siRNA into the HSC2 human OSCC cell line. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that biopsy tissue samples of 71.1% of the patients with OSCC were positive for CBR1. In addition, CBR1 expression status was correlated with the N classification (P<0.0001), stage (P=0.0018) and outcome (P=0.0095). Furthermore, a statistical correlation was determined between the protein expression status and overall survival (P=0.0171). In vitro studies indicated that the suppression of CBR1 by CBR1-siRNA increased cancer cell proliferative, wound healing and migratory abilities. These findings suggest that low expression levels of CBR1 may affect cancer prognosis, and that CBR1 may have potential as a prognostic factor for patients with OSCC.",29456845,2018,Low carbonyl reductase 1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.

In an effort to refine a model of clinical care identifying effective communication with health care providers (HCPs) as a key skill for successful transition to adult medical care, this study explored the perspectives of emerging adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) about factors that impact the quality and content of communication with their HCPs.


Methods
Twenty emerging adults with T1D were interviewed about health communication experiences with their pediatric HCP and readiness for transition to adult diabetes care. Interviews were recorded and transcribed; three raters coded transcripts using conventional content analysis for broad themes.


Results
Five themes emerged from the data capturing factors that influence emerging adult-HCP communication: HCP interaction style, HCP consistency, HCP support for autonomy, parental involvement in medical care, and emerging adult comfort with disclosure. Most emerging adults had not discussed transition to adult diabetes care with their HCP; some expressed confidence in their ability to transition while others expressed anxiety about the transition process.


Conclusions
Findings support the conceptual model of communication and inform clinical implications for working with emerging adults with T1D. Continuity of care should be prioritized with transition-age patients. Additionally, HCPs should initiate conversations about engagement in risky behaviors and transition to adult medical care and ensure emerging adults have time without parents to discuss these sensitive topics. Psychologists can enhance the transition process by facilitating effective patient-HCP communication and coaching both patients and HCPs to ask questions about risky behaviors and transition to adult medical care.",29456906,2017,Health Communication Experiences of Emerging Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.

The aim of this study was to assess awareness of performance and performance accuracy for a task that requires executive functions (EF), among healthy adolescents and to compare their performance to their parent's ratings.


Method
Participants: 109 healthy adolescents (mean age 15.2 ± 1.86 years) completed the Weekly Calendar Planning Activity (WCPA). The discrepancy between self-estimated and actual performance was used to measure the level of awareness. The participants were divided into high and low accuracy groups according to the WCPA accuracy median score. The participants were also divided into high and low awareness groups. A comparison was conducted between groups using WCPA performance and parent ratings on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).


Results
Higher awareness was associated with better EF performance. Participants with high accuracy scores were more likely to show high awareness of performance as compared to participants with low accuracy scores. The high accuracy group had better parental ratings of EF, higher efficiency, followed more rules, and were more aware of their WCPA performance.

However, recent research shows that learning effects once thought to be specific depend on subtleties of the training paradigm and that within even a simple training procedure there are multiple aspects of the task and stimuli that are learned simultaneously. Here, we suggest that learning on any task involves a broad network of brain regions undergoing changes in representations, read-out weights, decision rules, attention and feedback processes as well as oculomotor changes. However, importantly, the distribution of learning across the neural system depends upon the details of the training procedure and the characterstics of the individual being trained. We propose that to advance our understanding of PL, the field must move towards understanding how distributed brain processes jointly contribute to behavioral learning effects.",29457054,2018,Towards a whole brain model of Perceptual Learning.
608,"Background
Patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) are susceptible to significant vascular complications, such as aortic and visceral arterial ruptures, aneurysms, and dissection. We describe a case of repeated bleeding in a 57-year-old woman and a case of sudden onset of artery dissection in her daughter, both of whom were previously diagnosed with vascular EDS and managed at our institution.


Case presentation
A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency department due to sudden onset of left low back pain. Her past history included vascular EDS. An urgent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma and left external iliac artery dissection. Stent graft repair was performed. Five hours postoperatively, cardiac arrest occurred and resuscitation attempts failed. The 32-year-old daughter with genetically diagnosed vascular EDS was notified of the death of her mother during the customary end-of-life conference. Six hours after her mother's death, she was admitted to our emergency department due to sudden onset of left low back pain. On examination, she was not in hypovolemic shock, and weak pulses were palpable in the bilateral dorsalis pedis. An urgent abdominal CT scan revealed a right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma around the right external iliac artery and left external iliac artery dissection. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent conservative therapy consisting of bed rest and antihypertensive therapy with nicardipine. She developed no further vascular complications requiring surgical intervention and was discharged on the 21st hospital day.


Conclusions
Vascular rupture can be fatal in patients with vascular EDS. This report underscores the importance of strategic management of vascular complications to prevent rupture, and the importance of psychological care for the bereaved family given the hereditary nature of vascular EDS.",29457070,2017,Sudden onset of artery dissection in a 32-year-old woman with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to psychological stress of her mother's death: a case series.
609,"Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most common chronic disease. Dental tissue engineering is a promising alternative approach to alleviate the shortcomings of the currently available restorative materials. Mimicking the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) could enhance the performance of tissue engineering scaffolds. In this study, we developed microtubular (~20 μm diameter) polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) scaffolds resembling the tubular (~2.5 μm diameter) structure of dentin, the collagen-based mineralized tissue that forms the major portion of teeth, to study the effect of scaffold architecture on differentiation of mouse dental pulp cells in vitro. Flat (control), plasma-treated solid and microtubular PMMA scaffolds with densities of 240±15, 459±51 and 480±116 tubules/mm2 were first characterized using scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurements. Dental pulp cells were cultured on the surface of the scaffolds for up to 21 days and examined using various assays. Cell proliferation and mineralization were examined using Alamar Blue and Xylenol Orange (XO) staining assays, respectively. The differentiation of pulp cells into odontoblasts was examined by immunostaining for Nestin and by quantitative PCR analysis for dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1), dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) and osteocalcin (Ocn). Our results showed that the highest tubular density scaffolds significantly (p<0.05) enhanced differentiation of pulp cells into odontoblasts as compared to control flat scaffolds, as evidenced by increased expression of Nestin (5.4x). However, mineralization was suppressed on all surfaces, possibly due to low cell density. These results suggest that the microtubular architecture may be a desirable feature of scaffolds developed for clinical applications.


Lay Summary
Regenerative engineering of diseased or traumatized tooth structure could avoid the deficiencies of traditional dental restorative (filling) materials. Cells in the dental pulp have the potential to differentiate to dentin-producing odontoblast cells. Furthermore, cell-supporting scaffolds that mimic a natural extracellular matrix (ECM) are known to influence behavior of progenitor cells. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a dentin-like microtubular scaffold would enhance differentiation of dental pulp cells. The hypothesis was proven true and differentiation to odontoblasts increased with increasing density of the microtubules. However, mineralization was suppressed, possibly due to a low density of cells. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of a microtubular scaffold design to promote odontoblast cells for regeneration of dentin.",29457125,2017,Enhanced differentiation of dental pulp cells cultured on microtubular polymer scaffolds in vitro.
610,"Cell therapy is an emerging paradigm for the treatment of heart disease. In spite of the exciting and promising preclinical results, the benefits of cell therapy for cardiac repair in patients have been modest at best. Biomaterials-based approaches may overcome the barriers of poor differentiation and retention of transplanted cells. In this study, we prepared and tested hydrogels presenting extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived adhesion peptides as delivery vehicles for c-kit+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). We assessed their effects on cell behavior in vitro as well as cardiac repair in rats undergoing ischemia reperfusion. Hydrogels presenting the collagen-derived GFOGER peptide induced cardiomyocyte differentiation of CPCs as demonstrated by increased expression of cardiomyocyte structural proteins. However, conditioned media obtained from GFOGER hydrogels showed lower levels of secreted reparative factors. Interestingly, following injection in rats undergoing ischemia-reperfusion, treatment with CPCs encapsulated in nonadhesive RDG-presenting hydrogels resulted in the preservation of cardiac contractility and attenuation of postinfarct remodeling whereas the adhesion peptide-presenting hydrogels did not induce any functional improvement. Retention of cells was significantly higher when delivered with nonadhesive hydrogels compared to ECM-derived peptide gels. These data suggest that factors including cell differentiation state, paracrine factors and interaction with biomaterials influence the effectiveness of biomaterials-based cell therapy. A holistic consideration of these multiple variables should be included in cell-biomaterial combination therapy designs.",29457128,2018,Evaluation of Hydrogels Presenting Extracellular Matrix-Derived Adhesion Peptides and Encapsulating Cardiac Progenitor Cells for Cardiac Repair.
611,"Background
Human behaviors are affected by attitudes and beliefs, which in turn are shaped by higher-level values to which we have ascribed. In this study, we explore the relationship between two higher-level values, press freedom and LGBT freedom, and HIV infection with national data at the population level.


Methods
Data were the number of persons living with HIV (PLWH, n = 35,468,911) for 148 countries during 2011-15, press freedom index (PFI) determined by the Reporters Without Borders, and LGBT freedom index (LGBT-FI) based on laws regulating same-sex relationships and expression. PLWH prevalence (1/1000), PFI and LGBT-FI were mapped first. Multiple regression was thus used to associate the logarithm of PLWH prevalence with PFI, LGBT-FI and PFI × LGBT-FI interaction, controlling for per capita GDP and weighted by population size.


Results
Global prevalence of PLWH during 2011-15 was 0.51 per 1000 population. The prevalence showed a geographic pattern moving from high at the south and west ends of the world map to low at the north and east. Both PFI and LGBT-FI were positively associated with PLWH prevalence with a negative interaction between the two.


Conclusions
More people are infected with HIV in countries with higher press freedom and higher LGBT freedom. Furthermore, press freedom can attenuate the positive association between levels of LGBT freedom and risk of HIV infection. This study demonstrated the urgency for and provided data supporting further research to investigate potential cultural and socioecological mechanisms underpinning the complex relationship among press freedom, LGBT freedom and HIV infection, with data collected at the individual level.",29457142,2018,Cross-country Association of Press Freedom and LGBT freedom with prevalence of persons living with HIV: implication for global strategy against HIV/AIDS.

Guided imagery involves the controlled visualization of detailed mental images. This integrative health technique is used for healing, health maintenance, or the treatment of specific conditions. Guided imagery is an integral part of mindfulness meditation, hypnosis, and various relaxation exercises. However, evidence to support the widespread use and dissemination of guided imagery interventions has been lacking. The purposes of this scoping review were to document the scope of health outcomes and disease processes examined by guided imagery researchers and the journal outlets where this work has been published. Secondary purposes were to review the efficacy of guided imagery, risk of bias from studies published in selected integrative health journals, and gain feedback from clinicians in a practiced-based research network (PBRN) about potential barriers for use in clinical settings.


Methods
Ten bibliographic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1960 and 2013 that included adult participants. Descriptive and analytic methods were employed to document the journal outlets, diseases, and health outcomes investigated.


Results
320 RCTs that included more than 17,979 adult participants were reviewed. The published studies appeared in 216 peer-reviewed journals from diverse disciplines largely representing psychology, the sport sciences, rehabilitation, nursing, and medicine. Major outcomes observed were coping with pain, stroke recovery, anxiety, coping with stress, and sport skills. Practitioner feedback from the PBRN revealed some interest but skepticism and time constraints were discussed as barriers.

613,"Adolescence is a period of heightened risk-taking relative to both adulthood and childhood, due in part to peers' increased influence on adolescent decision making. Because adolescents' choices have harmful consequences, there is great interest in specific interventions that might attenuate risk taking. We hypothesized that it might be possible to reduce adolescent risk taking through an intervention targeting the ability/tendency to engage cognitive control processes. While some studies of Working Memory Training (WMT) have indicated subsequent enhancement of adults' cognitive control abilities, potential impacts on adolescent cognitive control have not been explored. Accordingly, we tested whether four weeks of WMT (relative to Active Control Training, ACT) might increase performance on cognitive control measures and decrease risk-taking in adolescents. Adolescents receiving WMT, compared to those receiving ACT, exhibited some evidence of improved short-term memory performance following the 4-week training period. Improvements did not significantly transfer to performance on basic cognitive control measures. However, on two risk-taking tasks administered at post-training either with or without an anonymous peer audience, adolescents who received WMT evinced suppressed levels of risk taking when observed by peers, an effect not seen in ACT. Further work is needed to more fully characterize the potential of WMT interventions in stemming risk behavior within adolescent samples.",29457149,2017,Working Memory Training in Adolescents Decreases Laboratory Risk Taking in the Presence of Peers.
614,"The detailed kinetic mechanism of the HOSO2 + 3O2 reaction, which plays a pivotal role in the atmospheric oxidation of SO2, was investigated using accurate electronic structure calculations and novel statistical thermodynamic/kinetic models. Explored using the accurate composite method W1U, the detailed potential energy surface (PES) revealed that the addition of O2 to a HOSO2 radical to form the adduct (HOSO4) proceeds via a transition state with a slightly positive barrier (i.e., 0.7 kcal mol-1 at 0 K). Such a finding compromises a long-term hypothesis about this channel of being a barrierless process. Moreover, the overall reaction was found to be slightly exothermic by 1.7 kcal mol-1 at 0 K, which is in good agreement with recent studies. On the newly-constructed PES, the temperature- and pressure-dependent behaviors of the title reaction were characterized in a wide range of conditions (T = 200-1000 K & P = 10-760 Torr) using the integrated deterministic and stochastic master equation/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (ME/RRKM) rate model in which corrections for hindered internal rotation (HIR) and tunneling treatments were included. The calculated numbers were found to be in excellent agreement with literature data. The sensitivity analyses on the derived rate coefficients with respect to the ab initio input parameters (i.e., barrier height and energy transfer) were also performed to further understand the kinetic behaviors of the title reaction. The detailed kinetic mechanism, consisting of thermodynamic and kinetic data (in NASA polynomial and modified Arrhenius formats, respectively), was also provided at different T & P for further use in the modeling/simulation of any related systems.",29457181,2018,Ab initio kinetics of the HOSO2 + 3O2 → SO3 + HO2 reaction.

A multi-component approach involving dietary modification and advocacy for a healthy lifestyle comprising of regular physical activity, minimizing screen time and behavioral interventions have been found beneficial in preventing obesity. A life-cycle approach has been recommended where preventive interventions go as far back as affecting maternal, fetal and early childhood nutrition and lifestyle. Family, school and community involvement is important for long term results, so is the involvement of government in developing policies that help create an environment and opportunities for healthy diet and physical activity.

The real tragedy, of course, is the disability, suffering, and early death that devastates families and communities. But all of society pays, with the annual medical cost estimated at $147 billion. The causal pathways are complex, but if we drill down, sugar is a deeply consequential pathway to obesity, and the single greatest dietary source is sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The copious amount of sugar in the American diet is no accident. Industry practices and regulatory failures have fueled this explosion. Yet there are sensible, effective interventions that would create the conditions for healthier behaviors. What are the key interventions, and how can we overcome the social, political, and constitutional roadblocks? Tobacco control offers a powerful model, suggesting that success requires a suite of interventions working in concert: labeling, warnings, taxation, portion sizes, product formulation, marketing restrictions, and bans in high-risk settings such as schools and hospitals.

618,"In the struggle over the durability of the Affordable Care Act, defenders of the ACA stand guard at many fronts. A major contribution of the ACA to nondiscrimination law, however, appears increasingly vulnerable. The ACA established significant new nondiscrimination protections for patients under section 1557 and its implementing regulations. Several of these regulations-including protections on the basis of gender identity and pregnancy termination-are now under reconsideration at the Department of Health and Human Services, after a nationwide injunction lasting almost a year. Nondiscrimination laws matter, of course, because they promote equal access to health care. But focusing on discriminatory behavior alone is a narrow view of the purpose and potential of nondiscrimination rules-and underestimates the stakes of softening section 1557. To evaluate these protections, we must consider not only their impacts on discriminatory behavior but also their behavioral and attitudinal impacts on patients and communities. This is because supportive or stigmatizing rules can exert an expressive effect: laws communicate information about prevailing social norms, they give some norms greater authority by virtue of the state's support, and they can shape community values. Through these expressive impacts, nondiscrimination laws may affect not only discriminatory behavior in health activities but also the attitudes, beliefs, and decisions of people who are legally protected.",29457243,2018,Raising the Stakes for Nondiscrimination Protections in the ACA.
619,"OBJECTIVE
Predictors of attrition and predictors and moderators of outcome were explored in a transdiagnostic sample of patients who received ten-session cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-T) for nonunderweight eating disorders. Body image flexibility, a protective positive body image construct, was hypothesized to be a significant moderator.


METHOD
Data from two case series were combined to form a sample of 78 participants who received CBT-T. Baseline measures of body image, negative affect, personality, and motivation (readiness to change and self-efficacy) were included as potential predictors. Global eating disorder psychopathology at each assessment point (baseline, mid- and post-treatment, 1- and 3-month follow-up) was the outcome variable. Predictors of attrition were assessed using logistic regression, and multilevel modeling was applied for predictors and moderators of outcome.


RESULTS
Body image flexibility emerged as the strongest predictor and moderator of global eating disorder psychopathology, followed by body image avoidance. Body checking, negative affect, personality beliefs, and self-efficacy were significant predictors of global eating disorder psychopathology.

620,"Alcohol intoxication may affect self-reports of alcohol use and related constructs, such as impulsivity and dependence symptoms. Improved knowledge about potential systematic reporting biases induced by alcohol, e.g. through disinhibition, may be relevant for the assessment of intoxicated individuals both in clinical routine and research. We therefore randomly assigned 54 socially drinking males aged 18 to 19 without lifetime diagnosis of DSM-IV alcohol dependence to one of two experimental arms: either placebo infusion at day 1 and alcohol infusion at day 2, or vice versa. The lab-based intravenous alcohol infusion produced a constant blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent. On each day, participants completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, as well as other questionnaires on alcohol expectancies, drinking motives and substance use-related temperament traits. We found that alcohol significantly increased self-reported expectancies (tension reduction) and motives (conformity; η2  = .16-.23), but we observed no effect of sequence, i.e. alcohol first versus placebo first (Pcorr  ≥ .118). High baseline alcohol expectancies did not moderate alcohol effects (Pcorr  ≥ .462). We conclude that moderate alcohol intoxication might not generally affect the reliability of self-reported alcohol use, alcohol use problems and psychological concepts related to drinking behavior in young males without alcohol dependence.

METHODS AND RESULTS
Pure cultures were inoculated in pasteurized grape juice in order to perform alcoholic fermentations. Some non-Saccharomyces species did not ferment, others did not get established, and none of them completed alcoholic fermentations. The physicochemical parameters of the wines and the abundance of aromatic compounds at the end of alcoholic fermentation highlighted the notable differences in the aroma forming ability and fermentative behavior of the different non-Saccharomyces species, but not within clones.


CONCLUSIONS
Lower diversity was detected within non-Saccharomyces species than that reported in S. cerevisiae with regard to enological behavior and aromatic profiles. M. pulcherrima and Lachancea thermotolerans are the two species with higher possibilities to become an inoculum.


SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
Few significant differences were found within clones of the same species, but very important parameters in wine quality, such as volatile acidity, ethyl acetate and acetoin, which would justify selection programs within those species.

622,"INTRODUCTION
Suicide is a multicausal human behavior, with devastating and immensely distressing consequences. Its prevalence is estimated to be 20-30 times greater in patients with bipolar disorders than in the general population. The burden of suicide and its high prevalence in bipolar disorders make it imperative that our current understanding be improved to facilitate prediction of suicide and its prevention. In this review, we provide a new perspective on the process of suicide in bipolar disorder, in the form of a novel integrated model that is derived from extant knowledge and recent evidence.


METHODS
A literature search of articles on suicide in bipolar disorder was conducted in recognized databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and PsycINFO using the keywords ""suicide"", ""suicide in bipolar disorders"", ""suicide process"", ""suicide risk"", ""neurobiology of suicide"" and ""suicide models"". Bibliographies of identified articles were further scrutinized for papers and book chapters of relevance.


RESULTS
Risk factors for suicide in bipolar disorders are well described, and provide a basis for a framework of epigenetic mechanisms, moderated by neurobiological substrates, neurocognitive functioning, and social inferences within the environment. Relevant models and theories include the diathesis-stress model, the bipolar model of suicide and the ideation-to-action models, the interpersonal theory of suicide, the integrated motivational-volitional model, and the three-step theory. Together, these models provide a basis for the generation of an integrated model that illuminates the suicidal process, from ideation to action.


CONCLUSION
Suicide is complex, and it is evident that a multidimensional and integrated approach is required to reduce its prevalence. The proposed model exposes and provides access to components of the suicide process that are potentially measurable and may serve as novel and specific therapeutic targets for interventions in the context of bipolar disorder. Thus, this model is useful not only for research purposes, but also for future real-world clinical practice.",29457330,2018,Modeling suicide in bipolar disorders.

624,"Nanoparticles degradable upon external stimuli combine pharmacokinetic features of both small molecules as well as large nanoparticles. However, despite promising preclinical results, several redox responsive disulphide-linked nanoparticles failed in clinical translation, mainly due to their unexpected in vivo behavior. Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most evaluated antioxidants responsible for disulfide degradation. Herein, the impact of GSH on the in vivo behavior of redox-sensitive nanogels under physiological and modulated conditions is investigated. Labelling of nanogels with a DNA-intercalating dye and a radioisotope allows visualization of the redox responsiveness at the cellular and the systemic levels, respectively. In vitro, efficient cleavage of disulphide bonds of nanogels is achieved by manipulation of intracellular GSH concentration. While in vivo, the redox-sensitive nanogels undergo, to a certain extent, premature degradation in circulation leading to rapid renal elimination. This instability is modulated by transient inhibition of GSH synthesis with buthioninsulfoximin. Altered GSH concentration significantly changes the in vivo pharmacokinetics. Lower GSH results in higher elimination half-life and altered biodistribution of the nanogels with a different metabolite profile. These data provide strong evidence that decreased nanogel degradation in blood circulation can limit the risk of premature drug release and enhance circulation half-life of the nanogel.",29457349,2018,Impact of Glutathione Modulation on Stability and Pharmacokinetic Profile of Redox-Sensitive Nanogels.

We analyzed subjects from the Truven Health MarketScan Claims database from 2001 to 2009. Infertile men were identified through diagnosis and treatment codes. Comparison groups included vasectomized men and an age-matched cohort who were not infertile and had not undergone vasectomy. We considered cancer types previously associated with infertility that were diagnosed after the diagnosis of infertility. The treatment regimens were determined based on the presence of claims with CPT codes for chemotherapy (CTX), radiation (RTX) or surgical treatment (ST) for each entity in all study groups. Cases with multimodal treatments were also identified. As a result, CTX was similarly distributed among the infertile, vasectomized, and control groups. In contrast, RTX treatment length was shorter in infertile men. The frequency of multimodal treatment (i.e., radiation and chemotherapy) was twofold lower in men with infertility compared to other men. By focusing on treatment patterns for each cancer type among these groups, the duration of RTX and CTX was shorter in infertile men diagnosed with NHL compared to controls. We conclude that Infertile men diagnosed with cancer and specific cancer types experience different treatment courses, with shorter RTX and less combined RTX/CTX compared to fertile and vasectomized men. These differences could reflect differences in stage at presentation, biological behavior, or treatment responses in infertile men.",29457365,2018,Male infertility is associated with altered treatment course of men with cancer.

The present study explored the potential for internet search data to serve as indicators of subjective well-being (SWB) and predictors of health at the state and metro area levels. We propose that searches for positive and negative affect-related terms represent information-seeking behavior of individuals who are experiencing emotions and seeking information about them.


METHOD
Data on the frequency of Google searches for 15 affect terms were collected from Google's Trends website (trends.google.com). These were paired with data on health, self-reported emotions, psychological well-being, personality, and Twitter postings at the state and metro area levels.


RESULTS
Several internet search scores correlated with indicators of cardiovascular health and depression. Some search term scores also correlated strongly with self-reported emotions, well-being metrics, neuroticism, per capita income, and Twitter postings at the state or metro area level. Multiple regression analyses suggest that affect searches predict depression rates at the metro area level beyond the effects of income and other well-being measures.

Here we present a detailed biophysical study on the behavior of dynamic SCPNs in living cells and an evaluation of their catalytic functionality in such a complex medium. We first developed a number of delivery strategies that allowed the selective localization of SCPNs in different cellular compartments. Live/dead tests showed that the SCPNs were not toxic to cells while spectral imaging revealed that SCPNs provide a structural shielding and reduced the influence from the outer biological media. The ability of SCPNs to act as catalysts in biological media was first assessed by investigating their potential for reactive oxygen species generation. With porphyrins covalently attached to the SCPNs, singlet oxygen was generated upon irradiation with light, inducing spatiallycontrolled cell death. In addition, Cu(I)- and Pd(II)-based SCPNs were prepared and these catalysts were screened in vitro and studied in cellular environments for the carbamate cleavage reaction of rhodamine-based substrates. This is a model reaction for the uncaging of bioactive compounds such as cytotoxic drugs for catalysis-based cancer therapy. We observed that the rate of the deprotection depends on both the organometallic catalysts and the nature of the protective group. The rate reduces from in vitro to the biological environment, indicating a strong influence of biomolecules on catalyst performance. The Cu(I)-based SCPNs in combination with the dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl protective group showed the best performances both in vitro and in biological environment, making this group promising in biomedical applications.",29457449,2018,Catalytically Active Single-Chain Polymeric Nanoparticles: Exploring Their Functions in Complex Biological Media.

Calibration, the degree to which a probabilistic estimate of an event reflects the true underlying probability of the event, has largely been neglected in the field of clinical psychology in favor of other components of accuracy such as discrimination (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Although it is frequently overlooked, calibration is a critical component of accuracy with particular relevance for prognostic models and risk-assessment tools. With advances in personalized medicine and the increasing use of probabilistic (0% to 100%) estimates and predictions in mental health research, the need for careful attention to calibration has become increasingly important.",29457474,2018,The Importance of Calibration in Clinical Psychology.
631,"This study aims to investigate the association between management and communication strategies and the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms presented by elderly people with Alzheimer's disease. One hundred and thirty-four family caregivers answered a questionnaire with socio-demographic data and questions regarding the care context, the Small Communication Strategies Scale, the Dementia Management Strategy Scale, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Caregivers used the criticism management strategy more when the elderly presented hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, irritability, nighttime behavior, and appetite abnormalities. The encouragement strategy was more significantly used only in the presence of euphoria/elation. The caregivers who used the most active management strategy were those who cared for the elderly with delirium, hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, irritability, and appetite and eating abnormalities. The use of communication strategies did not differ between groups with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is concluded that criticism management and active management strategies are strongly associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The results of this study may be useful for planning treatment interventions that aim to modify the use of management strategies used by caregivers.",29457487,2018,Dementia management strategies associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households in Baltimore, Maryland, from August 2014 to August 2015. Adult heads of household completed questions on diet, exercise, and perceived habits among network members. Our dependent variables were high added sugar intake (≥39.9 teaspoons/day), high fruit/vegetable intake (≥6.1 servings/day), and being physically active (≥moderately activity). Our network exposures were proportion of members perceived to daily consume (1) sugar-sweetened beverages, (2) sweets, (3) fruits, and (4) vegetables, as well as to weekly exercise (1) vigorously or (2) moderately. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine associations between habits with relevant network exposures. Our sample included 266 adults with mean age of 44.5 years, 86.1% women and 95.5% African American. We found a statistically significant association between study participants' high daily intake of added sugar with perceived network exposure to daily sugar-sweetened beverages (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.02, 1.20]) and daily sweets (OR = 1.10, 95% CI [1.02, 1.20]). Greater network exposure to weekly vigorous exercise was significantly associated with personally being physically active (OR = 1.15, 95% CI [1.04, 1.28]), but not network exposure to weekly moderate exercise. Among public housing residents, associations exist between individuals' and perceived networks' lifestyle habits of high added sugar foods consumption and vigorous exercise, which may hold promise for future social network interventions.",29457512,2018,Perceived Diet and Exercise Behaviors Among Social Network Members With Personal Lifestyle Habits of Public Housing Residents.
633,"PURPOSE
To describe caregiver challenges with and confidence managing three aggressive behavior types in persons with dementia: verbal aggression, destroying property, and threatening to hurt others.


DESIGN AND METHOD
Secondary analysis of baseline data from the 2001-2004 Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II (REACH II) initiative.


RESULTS
One or more aggressive behaviors within 1 week were reported by more than a third of caregivers, with most expressing upset but fewer expressing confidence managing the behaviors. Caregiver distress and confidence differed by race/ethnicity in response to verbal aggression, with more White/Caucasian caregivers expressing upset than Hispanic/Latinos or Black/African Americans. Fewer Hispanic/Latinos expressed confidence managing verbal aggression, compared with White/Caucasians or Black/African Americans.


DISCUSSION
Aggressive behaviors challenge caregivers, with reactions varying by behavior type and race/ethnicity.

Dental students have been identified as a group with high risks of developing both temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and psychosocial conditions. Our primary aim was to evaluate the cross-sectional prevalence of TMD diagnoses, as defined in the Diagnostic Criteria (DC)/TMD, among dental students. The secondary aim was to evaluate the prevalence and association of behavioural and psychosocial factors in relation to DC/TMD diagnoses.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted among undergraduate dental students during the second semester of their third year at the Department of Odontology, Medical Faculty, Umeå University, Sweden. Three consecutive cohorts were recruited during August in 2013, 2014, 2015. In total, 54 students were included and examined according the DC/TMD procedure.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of any DC/TMD diagnosis was 30%. The most prevalent TMD diagnosis was myalgia. Individuals with a TMD-pain diagnosis (i.e. myalgia or arthralgia) reported significantly higher pain intensity levels according to the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) as compared to individuals without TMD-pain (Fisher's exact test p < .001, two-sided). In addition, individuals with any TMD scored significantly higher jaw functional limitations according to the Jaw Functional Limitation Scale 20 (JFLS-20, p < .001) and oral parafunctions according to the Oral Behavior Checklist (OBC, p = .005) as compared to individuals without TMD. The psychosocial factors evaluated did not differ between individual with or without a TMD diagnosis. The majority of the dental students reported symptoms that are already identified as risk factors for developing TMD and pain conditions.

Biocompatibility and degradation of poly ε-caprolactone (PCL)-Biphasic Calcium Phosphate (BCP) scaffolds fabricated by the ""Melt Stretching and Compression Molding (MSCM)"" technique were evaluated in rat models.


OBJECTIVES
Degradation behaviors and histological biocompatibility of the PCL-20% BCP MSCM scaffolds and compare with those of PCL-20% β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds commercially fabricated by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) were evaluated.


METHODS
The study groups included Group A: PCL-20% BCP MSCM scaffolds and Group B: PCL-20% TCP FDM scaffolds, which were implanted subcutaneously in twelve male Wistar rats. On day 14, 30, 60 and 90, dimensional changes of the scaffolds and their surrounding histological features were assessed using Micro-Computed Tomography (μ-CT) and histological analysis. Changes of their molecular weight were assessed using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC).


RESULTS
Formation of collagen and new blood vessels throughout the scaffolds of both groups increased with time with low degrees of inflammation. The μ-CT and GPC analysis demonstrated that the scaffolds of both groups degraded with time, but, their molecular weight slightly changed over the observation periods. All results of both groups were not significantly different.

638,"Objective
The present study aimed to evaluate the influences of combined traffic noise (CTN) on the ability of learning and memory in mice.


Materials and Methods
The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were exposed to CTN from highways and high-speed railways for 42 days, whose day-night equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level (Ldn) was 70 dB(A). On the basis of behavioral reactions in Morris water maze (MWM) and the concentrations of amino acid neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, the impacts of CTN on learning and memory in mice were examined.


Results
The MWM test showed that the ability of learning and memory in mice was improved after short-term exposure (6-10 days, the first batch) to 70 dB(A) CTN, which showed the excitatory effect of stimuli. Long-term exposure (26-30 days, the third batch; 36-40 days, the fourth batch) led to the decline of learning and memory ability, which indicated the inhibitory effect of stimuli. Assays testing amino acid neurotransmitters showed that the glutamate level of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group in the first batch. However, the former was lower than the latter in the third and fourth batches. Both, behavioral reactions and the concentrations of amino acid neurotransmitters, testified that short-term exposure and long-term exposure resulted in excitatory effect and inhibitory effect on the ability of learning and memory, respectively.


Conclusion
The effects of 70 dB(A) CTN on the ability of learning and memory were closely related to the exposure duration. Furthermore, those effects were regulated and controlled by the level of glutamate in the hippocampus.",29457601,2018,Influences of combined traffic noise on the ability of learning and memory in mice.
639,"Knowing the density or abundance of primate populations is essential for their conservation management and contextualizing socio-demographic and behavioral observations. When direct counts of animals are not possible, genetic analysis of non-invasive samples collected from wildlife populations allows estimates of population size with higher accuracy and precision than is possible using indirect signs. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional indirect survey methods, prolonged or periodic genetic sampling across months or years enables inference of group membership, movement, dynamics, and some kin relationships. Data may also be used to estimate sex ratios, sex differences in dispersal distances, and detect gene flow among locations. Recent advances in capture-recapture models have further improved the precision of population estimates derived from non-invasive samples. Simulations using these methods have shown that the confidence interval of point estimates includes the true population size when assumptions of the models are met, and therefore this range of population size minima and maxima should be emphasized in population monitoring studies. Innovations such as the use of sniffer dogs or anti-poaching patrols for sample collection are important to ensure adequate sampling, and the expected development of efficient and cost-effective genotyping by sequencing methods for DNAs derived from non-invasive samples will automate and speed analyses.",29457631,2018,Non-invasive genetic censusing and monitoring of primate populations.
640,"Previous studies of nonhuman primates have found relationships between health and individual differences in personality, behavior, and social status. However, despite knowing these factors are intercorrelated, many studies focus only on a single measure, for example, rank. Consequently, it is difficult to determine the degree to which these individual differences are independently associated with health. The present study sought to untangle the associations between health and these individual differences in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We studied 85 socially housed macaques at the Oregon and California National Primate Research Centers, and used veterinary records to determine the number of injuries and illnesses for each macaque. We measured personality using 12 items from a well-established primate personality questionnaire, performed focal observations of behaviors, and calculated dominance status from directional supplant data. All twelve personality questionnaire items were reliable and were used to represent five of the six personality dimensions identified in rhesus macaques-Dominance, Confidence, Openness, Anxiety, and Friendliness (also known as Sociability). Following this, we fit generalized linear mixed effects models to understand how these factors were associated with an animal's history of injury and history of illness. In the models, age was an offset, facility was a random effect, and the five personality dimensions, behavior, sex, and dominance status were fixed effects. Number of injuries and illnesses were each best represented by a negative binomial distribution. For the injury models, including the effects did improve model fit. This model revealed that more confident and more anxious macaques experienced fewer injuries. For the illness models, including the fixed effects did not significantly improve model fit over a model without the fixed effects. Future studies may seek to assess mechanisms underlying these associations.",29457637,2018,"Rhesus macaque personality, dominance, behavior, and health."

Using a prospective longitudinal design, the authors investigated whether trajectories of frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry in children (Mage  = 6.39 years at enrollment) predicted subjective, behavioral, and autonomic indices of socioemotional processes. Resting frontal EEG activity was measured across four separate repeated assessments spanning approximately 2 years. Children's EEG asymmetry across assessments was best characterized by two trajectories: a stable right frontal asymmetry class (48.65%), and a stable left frontal asymmetry class (51.35%). At visit 4, children in the stable right frontal asymmetry displayed more avoidance-related tendencies and children in the stable left frontal asymmetry class exhibited more approach-related tendencies across social, emotional, and autonomic measures. These findings suggest that developmental patterns of resting frontal brain activity across the early school years may underlie approach- and avoidance-related motivation and predict socio-emotional processes in some children.",29457644,2018,Trajectories of frontal brain activity and socio-emotional development in children.

The cognitive behavioral model of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) suggests that cognitions and reduced activity level perpetuate the fatigue and impairment that individuals with CFS experience.

RESULTS
Findings were generally inconsistent with the cognitive behavioral model of CFS.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes are seafood pathogens of public health significance and predictive models are effective tools for quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of these pathogens. However, most current predictive models are based on growth of single strains in broth cultures and interactions of two or more bacteria in a food matrix can skew the outcomes of the predictions. Therefore, the impact of V. parahaemolyticus and L. monocytogenes when co-cultured and in mono culture on cooked shrimp at cold storage was investigated in this study.


RESULTS
The results indicated that L. monocytogenes co-cultured with V. parahaemolyticus exhibited reduced growth and longer lag phase at 4 °C and 10 °C. V. parahaemolyticus exhibited similar behavior when co-cultured with L. monocytogenes at 4 °C (Death rate, K=-0.67 Log10 CFU/g/day). The death rate of K at 10 °C when V. parahaemolyticus co-cultured with L. monocytogenes was -1.62 Log10 CFU/g/day. There was no significant reduction of growth in monoculture experiments.

645,"Human cognition and behavior are dominated by symbol use. This paper examines the social learning strategies that give rise to symbolic communication. Experiment 1 contrasts an individual-level account, based on observational learning and cognitive bias, with an inter-individual account, based on social coordinative learning. Participants played a referential communication game in which they tried to communicate a range of recurring meanings to a partner by drawing, but without using their conventional language. Individual-level learning, via observation and cognitive bias, was sufficient to produce signs that became increasingly effective, efficient, and shared over games. However, breaking a referential precedent eliminated these benefits. The most effective, most efficient, and most shared signs arose when participants could directly interact with their partner, indicating that social coordinative learning is important to the creation of shared symbols. Experiment 2 investigated the contribution of two distinct aspects of social interaction: behavior alignment and concurrent partner feedback. Each played a complementary role in the creation of shared symbols: Behavior alignment primarily drove communication effectiveness, and partner feedback primarily drove the efficiency of the evolved signs. In conclusion, inter-individual social coordinative learning is important to the evolution of effective, efficient, and shared symbols.",29457653,2018,How to Create Shared Symbols.
646,"To evaluate the effect of fish growth on mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) bioaccumulation, a non-steady state toxicokinetic model, combined with a Wisconsin bioenergetics model, was developed to simulate Hg and PCB bioaccumulation in Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). The model was validated by comparing observed versus predicted Hg and PCB 180 concentrations across 5 age classes from five different waterbodies across North America. The non-steady state model generated accurate predictions for Hg and PCB bioaccumulation in three of five waterbodies: Apsey, Sharbot and Stonelick Lake. The poor performance of the model for the Detroit River and Lake Hartwell, which were two well-known contaminated sites with possibly high heterogeneity in spatial contamination, was attributed to changes in the feeding behavior and/ or change in prey contamination. Model simulations indicate that growth dilution is a major component of contaminant bioaccumulation patterns in fish especially during early life stages and was predicted to be more important for hydrophobic PCBs compared to Hg. Simulations which considered tissue specific growth provided some improvement in model performance particularly for PCBs in fish populations which exhibited changes in their whole body lipid content with age. Higher variation in lipid growth compared with that of lean dry protein was also observed between different bluegill populations which partially explains the greater variation in PCB bioaccumulation slopes compared with Hg across sampling sites.

647,"Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling has previously been shown to have an important role on the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, including cocaine. Recently, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) have been proposed as intracellular transporters of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) as well as other bioactive lipids to their catabolic enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The role of these transporters in modulating the brains reward system has yet to be investigated. This study examined the effects of genetic deletion of FABP 5/7 on cocaine preference, as assessed by the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm. Male and female wild type (WT) and FABP 5/7 KO mice showed similar acquisition of cocaine CPP, with no differences found in overall locomotor activity. In addition, while male and female WT mice showed stress-induced CPP for cocaine, male and female FABP 5/7 KO mice failed to show a stress-induced preference for the cocaine-paired chamber. Additionally, serum corticosterone levels were analyzed to explore any potential differences in stress response that may be responsible for the lack of stress-induced preference for cocaine. Serum samples were obtained in animals under basal conditions as well as following a 30-min tube restraint stress. Male and female FABP 5/7 KO mice showed reduced corticosterone levels under stress compared to their WT counterparts. The reduction in corticosterone response under stress may mediate that lack of a stress-induced preference for cocaine in the FABP 5/7 KO mice. Thus, the role of FABPs may play an important role in drug-seeking behavior under stressful conditions.",29457656,2018,Fatty acid binding protein deletion prevents stress-induced preference for cocaine and dampens stress-induced corticosterone levels.
648,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Gambling Disorder (GD) is characterized by recurrent gambling behavior that is associated with significant impairment and distress, high psychiatric comorbidities, and high functional disability. The military veteran population appears particularly susceptible to developing the disorder, but relatively little has been studied among this population. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the clinical psychopathologies and comorbidities of veterans seeking treatment for problem gambling and how problem gambling may impact functioning.


METHODS
Treatment-seeking veterans meeting criteria for GD (N = 61) underwent a structured clinical interview and completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for Gambling Disorder (PG-YBOCS), the Gambling Belief Questionnaire (GBQ), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).


RESULTS
Veterans seeking treatment for GD had high rates of psychiatric and addiction disorder comorbidities. Few veterans had previously sought treatment and most reported substantive challenges in social and occupational functioning. When determining how gambling-related characteristics (ie, severity and cognitive distortions) impact function, severity of cognitive distortions was the strongest statistical predictor of overall functional disability.


CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE
The findings from this study indicate that there is high comorbidity between GD and other psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as social and occupational functioning. In addition, cognitive distortions related to gambling relate importantly to overall functioning and should be considered in the development of interventions for veterans with GD.

OBJECTIVE
Multiple studies were evaluated investigating the therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in treatment of SUDs.


METHOD
Through literature searches (eg, PubMed, Google Scholar), 60 studies (2000-2017) were identified examining the effect of rTMS, tDCS, or DBS on cravings and consumption of SUDs, including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and stimulants.


RESULTS
rTMS and tDCS demonstrated decreases in drug craving and consumption, while early studies with DBS suggest similar results. Results are most encouraging when stimulation is targeted to the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC).


CONCLUSIONS
Short-term treatment with rTMS and tDCS may have beneficial effects on drug craving and consumption. Future studies should focus on extending therapeutic benefits by increasing stimulation frequency and duration of treatment.

Despite their prevalence in certain clinical populations, our understanding of the neurobiological cause of repetitive behavior is lacking. Likewise, not knowing the pathophysiology has precluded efforts to find effective drug treatments. Our comparisons between mouse strains that differ in their expression of repetitive behavior revealed an important role of the subthalamic nucleus. In mice with high rates of repetitive behavior, we found significant differences in dendritic spine density, gene expression, and neuronal activation in the subthalamic nucleus. Taken together, these data demonstrate a hypoglutamatergic state. Furthermore, by using environmental enrichment to reduce repetitive behavior, we found evidence of increased glutamatergic tone in the subthalamic nucleus with our measures of spine density and gene expression.

The utility and maturity of the original Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model have been verified in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. But little research has clarified whether the model has effect on glycemic control. The main purpose of this study is to modify the IMB model to explore self-management on glycemic control in T2DM patients in Shanghai, China.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sampling method between June and August 2015 in three tertiary hospitals and four community health service centers. Totally 796 participants meeting the inclusion criteria (age ≥18 years and a diagnosis of T2DM) completed the anonymous questionnaire and blood test for glycemic control.

RESULTS
The modified model demonstrated an acceptable fit of the data. Paths from information to self-management behaviors (β=0.119, P<0.01) and HbA1c (β=-0.140, P<0.001), from motivation to behavioral skills (β=0.670, P<0.001), from behavioral skills to self-management behaviors (β=0.562, P<0.001) and from self-management behaviors to HbA1c (β=-0.343, P<0.001) were all significant and in the predicted direction. Information and motivation co-varied with each other (r=0.350, P<0.001). The modified IMB model of HbA1c <7% could not be well explained.

Swimming, stationary (circular) track running, and treadmill running are all commonly used methods for measuring endurance. Despite the use of these methods across a broad range of taxa, how comparable these methods are to one another, and whether they are biologically relevant, is rarely examined. We used Australian water dragons (Intellagama lesueurii), a species that is morphologically adept at climbing, swimming, and running, to compare these three methods of endurance and examined if there is repeatability within and between trial methods. We found that time to exhaustion was not highly repeatable within a method, suggesting that single measures or a mean time to exhaustion across trials are not appropriate. Furthermore, we compared mean maximal endurance times among the three methods, and found that the two running methods (i.e., stationary track and treadmill) were similar, but swimming was distinctly different, resulting in lower mean maximal endurance times. Finally, an individual's endurance rank was not repeatable across methods, suggesting that the three endurance trial methods are not providing similar information about an individual's performance capacity. Overall, these results highlight the need to carefully match a measure of performance capacity with the study species and the research questions being asked so that the methods being used are behaviorally, ecologically, and physiologically relevant.",29457704,2018,Comparability and repeatability of three commonly used methods for measuring endurance capacity.

To explore palliative care stakeholders' views on what makes a patient more or less complex and insights on capturing complexity at patient-level.


DESIGN
In-depth qualitative interviews, analysed using Framework analysis.


PARTICIPANTS/SETTING
Semi-structured interviews across six UK centres with patients, family, professionals, managers and senior leads, purposively sampled by experience, background, location and setting (hospital, hospice and community).


RESULTS
65 participants provided an understanding of complexity, which extended far beyond the commonly used physical, psychological, social and spiritual domains. Complexity included how patients interact with family/professionals, how services' respond to needs and societal perspectives on care. 'Pre-existing', 'cumulative' and 'invisible' complexity are further important dimensions to delivering effective palliative and end-of-life care. The dynamic nature of illness and needs over time was also profoundly influential. Adapting Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, we categorised findings into the microsystem (person, needs and characteristics), chronosystem (dynamic influences of time), mesosystem (interactions with family/health professionals), exosystem (palliative care services/systems) and macrosystem (societal influences). Stakeholders found it acceptable to capture complexity at the patient-level, with perceived benefits for improving palliative care resource allocation.


CONCLUSION
Our conceptual framework encompasses additional elements beyond physical, psychological, social and spiritual domains and advances systematic understanding of complexity within the context of palliative care. This framework helps capture patient-level complexity and target resource provision in specialist palliative care.",29457743,2018,"A framework for complexity in palliative care: A qualitative study with patients, family carers and professionals."
654,"The positive effects of physical activity on bone strength are certain. However, researchers have yet to precisely quantify the contribution of specific characteristics of physical activity that affect bone strength in children and adolescents. This commentary highlights 2 noteworthy 2017 publications that addressed osteogenic physical activity dose-response issues. Both papers moved the field forward by providing new insights on physical activity exposures beyond high-impact loading. Koedijk et al's paper was selected because, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first systematic review to solely examine associations between sedentary behavior and indicators of bone strength. The second selected paper, Gabel et al, used novel approaches in accelerometer processing and statistical modeling to separate the osteogenic effects of frequency of short bouts of physical activity from total volume of physical activity. As such, the authors of this paper begin to explore in youth what animal models have shown for some time, that is, optimal bone adaptation requires the correct combination of intensity, frequency, duration, nonrepetitive movement, and rest. Together, these papers signal new and important approaches for the conceptualization, measurement, and interpretation of osteogenic physical activity.",29457753,2018,Bone Strength and Exercise During Youth-The Year That Was 2017.
655,"Transitions between hospital and community are particularly challenging for vulnerable adults experiencing behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) of dementia. Too often, miscommunication results in triggering a recurrence of disruptive behaviours leading to frustration of staff and families. As part of the implementation of Health Quality Ontario (HQO) Quality Standards, this project involved improving transitions using an electronic-based care plan on a 23-bed geriatric dementia unit in a mental health hospital. ""My Dementia Careplan,"" is an interprofessional care plan that was developed in the electronic medical record (EMR) to enhance communication of information between healthcare providers when patients are being discharged to the community. It is written from the patient's perspective in collaboration with the family and interprofessional team. It describes strategies to manage behavioural challenges along with the standardized tools to objectively monitor progress. This care planning will help to support transition of knowledge between hospital and community.",29457768,2017,Mending the Cracks: A Case Study in Using Technology to assist with Transitional Care for Persons with Dementia.
656,"BACKGROUND
Smoking cessation is correlated with several psychological, social, biological, and pharmacological aspects. The combined tendency to experience negative emotions and to inhibit the expression of these emotions is indicated as ""type D personality,"" an independent risk marker for clinical outcome in cardiac disease. Despite this effect of type D personality on cardiovascular disease, it is still unclear whether this personality trait may influence smoking cessation after a myocardial infarction.


HYPOTHESIS
we hypothesized that there is a relationship between type D personality and smoking persistence in acute coronary syndrome patients, and this association may predict a worse long-term prognosis.


METHODS
The study enrolled 231 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Type D scale 14 (ds 14) was administered upon admission to the hospital.


RESULTS
After controlling for demographic and clinical confounders, non-type D patients reported statistically significant higher frequencies of smoking cessation when compared with the type D group. In addition, the presence of this psychological factor anticipates significantly the onset of smoking during adolescence. Furthermore, current type D smokers had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Type D personality and smoking status increase the risk of cardiac events. An emotionally stressed personality and persistence of smoking after the first cardiac event, and mostly their mutual influence, indicate a population at high cardiovascular risk.",29457844,2018,Effect of type D personality on smoking status and their combined impact on outcome after acute myocardial infarction.
657,"Aggression between male conspecifics is a complex social behavior that is likely modulated by multiple gene variants. In this study the BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains (RIS) were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying behaviors associated with intermale aggression. Four hundred and fifty-seven males from 55 strains (including the parentals) were observed at an age of 13 +/- 1 week in a resident-intruder test following 10 days of isolation. Attack latency was measured directly within a 10 minute time period and the test was repeated 24 hours later. The variables we analyzed were the proportion of attacking males in a given strain as well as the attack latency (on days 1 and 2, and both days combined). On day 1, 29% of males attacked, and this increased to 37% on day 2. Large strain differences were obtained for all measures of aggression, indicating substantial heritability (intraclass correlations 0.10-0.18). We identified a significant QTL on chromosome (Chr) 1 and suggestive QTLs on mouse Chrs 1 and 12 for both attack and latency variables. The significant Chr 1 locus maps to a gene-sparse region between 82 and 88.5 Mb with the C57BL/6J allele increasing aggression and explaining about 18% of the variance. The most likely candidate gene modulating this trait is Htr2b which encodes the serotonin 2B receptor and has been implicated in aggressive and impulsive behavior in mice, humans, and other species.",29457871,2018,A QTL on chromosome 1 modulates inter-male aggression in mice.
